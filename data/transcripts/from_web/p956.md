<timemark seconds="470" />

The Joe Rogan Experience

<timemark seconds="478" />

yes what's up brother how are you man please being squeezed into a sports jacket or a suit for conventional reasons that your mom put you in there after church or something we got to the office soon as you put a dude you thinking several steps ahead I like it

<timemark seconds="518" />

we're going to get into the sandwich before the podcast about these press junkets in about how you entertain yourself by forcing yourself to use a certain word

<timemark seconds="530" />

yeah the danger the the Westing in the film business is press junkets and as you would say no brother and effective and that's my suspicions to then that will soak in efficient and effective cuz you said inch a sound comes in and they ask you a question

<timemark seconds="548" />

why How could an actor is David Beckham when he says it on the pencil whatever it is and you answer it and some fossil fashion and on the fourth time you want to answer that question you'll want to swap flies are you stopped and got mad so what happens is you have to play games with yourself so you get someone on the side to throw different was it you like violence you to know that you'd and then that keeps you occupied could you thinking when someone else me about Beckman is on the pants off somehow got a stick in a race a minute you'd I don't say it's not easy and your aunt has become very creative ask someone to be sincere and ask the same questions over and over and over again to them like to have people keep filing in a new person comes in and asks it so tell us about this film and how did this get started and so whose idea was it

<timemark seconds="602" />

so I'm a short film jumble make Excalibur about 1990 and impressionable young man of 10 and it was the first line

<timemark seconds="612" />

knights in shining armor film ever spoke to me I wasn't particular interest in Errol Flynn or in combination that they did in the 50s in the Shamrock and spoke to one another they were shouted at one another so it took some time before you realize that's why it's so hard to solve we draft position of being Camp yet simultaneously aggressive and $25 and the visual effects and Las Vegas Shani 19th century armor and made a real impression on me because it was it was a voice it was a creative voice so it made an impression on me

<timemark seconds="662" />

I need somewhere in the Attic of my mind are relegated to the point where I had enough creative ideas in my reservoir to bring it forward to make it film and then someone gave me money and Warner Brothers wanted to make it and then it was the Challenger suppose of trying to take us to join into this

<timemark seconds="680" />

weld the fantasy Epic Fantasy medieval Lord of the Rings econ of the world and it's completely out of my wheelhouse so I found the challenge provocative an exciting as well as a fasting error genre you know the fascinating world of the fantasy neon Knights and swords and bows and arrows and round for whatever reason it's been like intoxicating to people for a long time he is an archetype the superheroes obviously was the first superhero he is old 14 hundred years old and it's

<timemark seconds="734" />

is relevant today as it was then that because it's not rocket on that somehow kids are the dress up as Mom and please been sandwiches or nights so we like

<timemark seconds="747" />

we relived it

<timemark seconds="749" />

it's an outfit that we wore 1,200 years ago so you feel familiar in it it's just it's fascinating that one jonra that one sort of archetype is just locked into the psyche of people yeah it's just it's there the other thing about it which is quite fun cuz you can take these kind of mystical rides into metaphor so you can symbolize things with 300 for Elephants would you call somebody in for real estate license

<timemark seconds="786" />

using CGI means moving a lot of it

<timemark seconds="793" />

boring the creative Asturias Spain this movie I'm used to making movies at 8:30. How was 3 months 6 weeks to shoot two months to a date is 3 months to do the whole thing or to write it to write it and to shoot it the whole thing from the beginning to the end of six months and then three months site for editing so you're wrapped impacting on Stemmons so this is a totally different kind of commitment

<timemark seconds="828" />

Jr's your mind and yeah if I'm reading you what I was getting into I would have also double bubble on the side of a good cuz you saw things to be here in the Hof it's no it's 3 is

<timemark seconds="842" />

can you play a movie like it's a big Epic movie do you have an actual schedule of when you think it's going to begin and when it's going to end or do you do but you know the terrain filmmaking is changed exponentially like everything a lot with technology so what was putting it off Jerry's don't put in this year to release dates of a real dog so we had to release the witch is projected a couple years from when you stop movies that Guy brought his check my the movie you'll coming out in

<timemark seconds="874" />

Louis Blues Restaurant exactly a year ago but then what happens if you're not branded movie you get elbowed off that date in Star Wars or something will come along and then you don't have to compete with sidewalls see you going to move cuz you come see lots of brands of this isn't something that we used to suffer because everyone was equal Kevin into the equation you give yourself the advantage of having a movie star or something but that doesn't exist exist now is the brand is the big brother so he comes my sling and Bullies his way until we can't and that's why you can't really get new films breaking through because those occupy the weekends already occupied. Seuss a real real strong the date that will come in one weekend off the Guardians the first hit

<timemark seconds="931" />

and it's very dangerous being within the parameters of a of a big movie that's a really interesting thing that only movies have to go through these days right that means it's one of the rare things where people are getting out and going to see something that's been made together in a group you know that you're you're watching media like it's not a live performance it's something that's been created and it's going to press play at 8 p.m. on Friday night and everyone is going to go to see if you got to get as many of those people together as you can the rare things like that so you're opening weekend everything's about they know what you're the make by Thursday evening right. You're coming is supposed to be coming out Friday by Sunday night evening clever people out there that happening to Club little boxes and computer says that the data and special tomorrow

<timemark seconds="987" />

how about never used to be the case she's coming up set and I think that this is a failure it hasn't lived up to expectations even if it's a creative success is good and movies find their own way usually in the end anyway but the key financial aspect has become polarized it's too significance of a component in the equation could not form right in the end of the day somehow you want to unify reconcile

<timemark seconds="1035" />

thought so cuz there was such a different reconcile those put it in a nice little package so you put in a a pill with a sweet wrapper around it and then you and then you should be happy you should have the substance and you should have the flavor

<timemark seconds="1053" />

but the now the focus is on the flavor and all the substance and that's result orientated so you movie comes out they got to put it might slow down song

<timemark seconds="1067" />

the question first of all we should be what's the movie like brother what do you make each just become too competitive into comparative financially and I love it. LaBelle and I like things that successful but it has to be second reason was primary and primary is what's it like creatively a film like not to sit on it but Fast and Furious all I heard about was how much money made that's all you hear it's like the big story the biggest fast the Furious opening box office hundreds of millions and he's like why is it so appealing at this movie is made a billion dollars because it's comparative in this competitive like two people in the audience because it's you can it's like Spectators Bowl who's the winner

<timemark seconds="1125" />

but like a Floyd Mayweather you want to find out how much money you made give me two hundred million dollars at 5 to get excited about it's an extra element Victorious Life the people can have through Sports Stars celebrities and success if they feel somehow related to or they went on the opening weekend or they are invested in that if it's successful and somehow proliferate successful rate of business but you're also a business enterprise mean you're you're a financial business and what is a guy like you like your movies have a certain flavor you know I can start off with Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels like that movie has a flavor to it and then your other films like people want to go to see that kind of flavor from your fealty feel like pressure in that regard like to live up to those expectations or the

<timemark seconds="1185" />

form to these ideas if people have of your movies yes or no

<timemark seconds="1189" />

is an okay depends what mood to catch me in right I like what I do and I'm going to do it anyway I just want some people pay me to do it and give me the money to get to do it so I don't mind the financial aspect of it I didn't mind films having to compete if there is a Reconciliation as I say that the primary component should be on the quality of the work that should be with Primerica garage films being successful I'd like them to be successful I like the competitive element but sometimes Executives you realize my your priorities are on the wrong thing here in the end it is a creative medium and that is what has to be primary do they get in the way of a guy like you though like I would imagine a guy like you that give you a certain amount of leeway than I gave you only way that's beautiful positive

<timemark seconds="1246" />

hopefully what is your individual idiosyncrasies they want you to put your imprint upon the work and I've been nothing but encouraging in that sense but you know people betray their agendas while you're in luck conversation will they betray their priorities you want to trust a man because he's a man of substance and 2 degree Independence so he's not looking to me to find himself through me so you're not asking me to tell you who you are that's the ongoing Battle of life people tell us who we are right and independence from that is Malik be trusted I don't want anything from you and thereby I could be kind to you because I don't need to manipulate you you no longer crotch right so it's got to be very difficult to find out exactly what his real motives really are

<timemark seconds="1306" />

then nevermind find suits never know how they dress in the polling suits really yeah I mean occasionally you find token pocket square that you can tell her heart's not in it the wife stuck it in there cuz she saw someone on TV that had a bit of Razzle Dazzle about

<timemark seconds="1338" />

suits or thing the death of the suit who was the death of the suit was the present attitude toward on going alone and I don't want to stick how it's how I feel but that's that's what happened we being brainwashed to not just like gentlemen but I see a guy like you and I say that's a peeling I look how you're dressed in a conservative suit this is a nice you like I'm sure you could wear any suit you wanted but you chose assert that has a certain look to it yeah I have spent some time I'll swing around a bit like the same reason that we spent time asking around with L pocket square it's I remember thinking how much I found a suit repugnant and I became angry that the soup being robbed from and so I had to create an alibi the way in to understand why is that I'd like a suit this was the magic of round

<timemark seconds="1398" />

the magic of Ralph Lauren nice Jewish boy from New York who Lipschitz created a waspy Empire

<timemark seconds="1406" />

there's a wonderful expression that you think you're distressed British and Ralph Lauren created this great Empire I resold waspy world back to the waspy world actually not to the most people in England there was a sort of resentment about Savile Row to ditional tailoring because the office is the number crunchers to come along and there's a creativity in the suit a suit needs to be creative the person that puts it on, be putting it on because he's told to put it on he's going to want to put it on so what Ralph did is he fashioned up this so of Quasi New England well and so he took on a truck Peterbilt of cliche any refashion that cliche to give it a new sense of life and you sense of brat he put black people in the suits wear traditional it was just the one man suit you made it feeling you we gave it takes what he did is he

<timemark seconds="1466" />

the old well Battleship Texas have a new world and wasps to find their way back into the world with an eloquent narrative I'm fascinated by the way your brain works because for you it's important that the person want to wear the suit and I'm feeling that that's so that's symbolic of how you feel about life itself like the person has want to be doing what they're doing that's a want to wear that suit it has to be an authentic gesture willink right now now that's the important book that is lots of books in this thing but they were very eloquent about it

<timemark seconds="1520" />

if you don't learn something new on the bus

<timemark seconds="1524" />

you have to take full responsibility for everything that you do why be subservient you must be the master of your own kingdom

<timemark seconds="1537" />

I feel you mix a lot of sense that you can just booked into things with their own eyes off of you will walk into things with your eyes fully open you don't know what you're getting into you have to take possession of your life is this a thought process they have to constantly reaffirm versus some form of meditational Mantra that you decide to a spouse

<timemark seconds="1564" />

the needs to be some. In the old day where you remember

<timemark seconds="1571" />

but there's a world out there trying to tell you who you are and it swelled in here that's trying to tell you who you are now where you want to put your ex because the world outside is very noisy and very tempting and as all the Razzamatazz as all the tents Manolo glitter

<timemark seconds="1588" />

it's called the toys

<timemark seconds="1591" />

but that's because you don't think you were enough in the first place for the first place the whole idea of the world to sell yourself as Festival to have to make you feel bad about yourself less than inside a minor present is Sister by the way it is the system

<timemark seconds="1609" />

what's the expression about tonight don't hate the player hate the game tonight the game love the game cuz you're so only game acceptable a move on into the rules the world with you you are and you have to tell yourself who you are and this is ongoing battle that somehow the needs to be a Reconciliation between the two but in the end you've got to have all the eggs in your basket

<timemark seconds="1638" />

there's also an ongoing internal battle that was in there there's the you that you want people to think you are and there's a you who you are and trying to figure out like how do I how do I figure out who I am I can do do I have a correct Assumption of how the people are receiving me and how I actually am objectively or am I bullshiting the world with this suit and pocket square yeah I would say that's exactly the scenario that was joking about the external world is I'm asking you to tell me who I am that's what we're playing at in as soon as you stop play. Whatever you want to call it but that's the dynamic that were in it somehow we have to

<timemark seconds="1692" />

give ourselves enough confidence to reassure ourselves the way enough however into the game because I got so I will in the suit under the weather suit suit mean by paying for it I mean by owning it it's now my suit it's my idea to put on the suit I have to pass my eyes in some way I have to understand a narrative that allows me to I would not suit and they buy up on my suit, and I come out into the world I guess what I'm a good time because I'm owning the suit that is a very Roc solid philosophy written down

<timemark seconds="1735" />

it's what the essence of narrative I'm Storyteller the essence of narrative is only about this Dynamic there is nothing else in the story other than this dynamic

<timemark seconds="1747" />

so the struggle between other people's perceptions and your own wants and desires and who you truly are your your significant realself that's it that's hilarious you tell me a story that didn't that we engaged in this famous that's not about this journey I'll give an example the particle son

<timemark seconds="1771" />

Parable Christian seems the religious 10% sure but a bunch of laid out set as a father has two sons and I was only understand how do you say to them he wants to spend their inheritance the youngest has his and the youngest son takes all the time and he runs off and sniffs Coke off strip two states full movie is entity realizes

<timemark seconds="1798" />

this is getting pretty boring and I'm in a lot of trouble he ends up feeding

<timemark seconds="1804" />

throwing food pics that's his job

<timemark seconds="1807" />

how do you count even eat the food that you give to the pics at which point he says Dad will you take me back

<timemark seconds="1815" />

that thing goes to they don't meet happens not through telephones it just happens at which point he called that what's going on with you since the beginning helping loyal to you and I hear the stories of my younger brother coming back he's been sniffing Coke of strippers tits for the last time and you prepared kill the fatted calf what's the airspeed that I want another story

<timemark seconds="1845" />

this is your Aunt something about that you take a step to the song Angel with baby thing you a good boy at which point you guys out to make the park up some the whites. The whites with some returns and he says

<timemark seconds="1858" />

you and Austin I found

<timemark seconds="1860" />

that's the end of the story

<timemark seconds="1863" />

it's quite hard to make sense of that in the literal sense you got was a bit unfair to call into the oldest son cuz he never ran off and did anything

<timemark seconds="1873" />

but the essence of the story is that you are the father

<timemark seconds="1880" />

you are enough

<timemark seconds="1883" />

your oldest son is your intellect says that he's trying to reconcile make sense of a prosaic and material world the youngest son being the one child Federal entity that is what's going on about

<timemark seconds="1902" />

Chili's recklessness and sense of adventure he finds you can't escape himself

<timemark seconds="1910" />

she has to return to himself at which point he has to accept who he is with plenty intellect is left out the equation pretty much is the older brother because he can understand the significance of the Journey of the wasteful brother in the end you have to leave yourself to understand the value of yourself you have to lose stuff before you realize the older stuff that you losing is ephemeral and Transit rate so it was you or not you were wise enough but you've got to somehow prostitute yourself before you realize Ram value fact is the SS full stories that's deep Guy Ritchie you think about all the time or just cemented philosophy so you just made

<timemark seconds="1960" />

a man is a king has a son the son the father is runs into back of a grub the son jumps into a little boat little skillet skillet that's why you cook your chops on internet little skiff skiff takes off down the river by prostitutes in a brothel and the stands straight he becomes king on the street he works his way out the different ladas and then he pulls the sword from a stone a sudden point in his life Centerpoint Eeveelution Americans on to be the king of a bathtub

<timemark seconds="2008" />

but he's he's I'm King takes us to join into the material world has flammable the different runs on the ladder and also he has to return to himself the significance of the extraction from the sword from the stone is the stone is the material world material well that seems we'll sell it because it controls you whilst you're projecting your sense of identity of Punnett the extraction of the stone is taking back your own authority your own

<timemark seconds="2036" />

Divinity Iran Authority around identity whatever it is that you could call that you're in Pala you will no longer looking for a sense of self outside of yourself and then you have to face the demons that you created and your history facing them and fighting them in owning them you put them in the face of who you are and that's a wrestling match you have to take away all these crutches and that's all that we struggle from in life is taking Prodigy's please tell me who I am please give me a bit more money so people think you are and you're liberated from your home thing it's back to the story can you please not just the store at the office to storyville narrative

<timemark seconds="2079" />

do you think that most people that are watching the film we're going to get that though they're just going to get an entertaining story they're just going to see a bunch of cool stuff some drama play out but this is fascinating that you're operating so many levels underneath it you better Storyteller business-to-business understand story and you need to understand why everything is literal there's nothing wrong with literalism it is what it is it's the guy you can glean what you can claim when you're ready to clean while you're ready to claim are you Joseph Campbell fan

<timemark seconds="2115" />

Iowa Jose California that mean that's a recurring theme in his work the hero's journey has the hero's journey these underlying sort of narrative that

<timemark seconds="2126" />

just really guides all all stories not ancient tales and that there's something inherently human about them important about these stories and they resonate with the our wants and needs and goals and even also maybe the structure that we really truly need in our own life

<timemark seconds="2142" />

yeah I mean. Or he's from whatever. I'm sympathetic to this particular to Jersey Campbell's philosophy on this religion is religion has done to the spiritual significance of narrative

<timemark seconds="2163" />

he's literally says that it's putting on a suit of armor on something that's wrong the spectacular doing it convention you doing for others you're not doing it for you and then I'll let remind we look at the narrative and we see the narrative for what we believe it to be exterior narrative so we completely we see the world upside down we don't wear no actually interested in the essence of the narrative because we're so busy pandering of the approval of others to everything that we see every narrative that we listen to every film that you say you're not really interested in it

<timemark seconds="2208" />

so you're interested in its body because that's what we correspond to it's fascinating that you're comparing it to Suits because it resonates like when you think of a guy showing up for work or getting ready for work he doesn't want to go and he's putting on his suit and it's dredging through and putting it on and you think about a guy was Crispus talking in his collars and putting on his cufflinks and tightening up is Ty and it feels empowered by the whole process of it it's very it's very appealing it like to be seen in a film to three exciting this amount of purpose so that you didn't mean streets so now you remember never really thought about that until this conversation because I just I don't really wear suits occasionally

<timemark seconds="2268" />

food for a long time to run from us slowly managed to pull that bass true that clothes man eat your a forty-five-year-old Giza and you still dressing house is a lot about what some people like to be comfortable though I get back by the way and they like that look comfortable your suits going into this completely constructed on the inside my body Chapel Brunello knows what he's doing these are all handmade tailored yeah, things tweets but it's as comfortable as a pair of pajamas so they all have to be comfortable

<timemark seconds="2324" />

everything about ties though go on I kill someone with a tie on Fisher can kill someone if I got a hold of that tie your dad Joe is compensation needs to go on a longer that's got to go up

<timemark seconds="2339" />

something about tide you wear the Rope around your neck if someone just gets a deep grabbed you have to in a deep disagreement you have to wrestle that sucker loose and taking off to be safe

<timemark seconds="2358" />

I'm not going down with this you should have my own personal problem I just feel like someone with a tie on all you have to do is grab that thing and that's a wrap like if you went to a Jiu-Jitsu match near the Rope running I cured you just to practitioner write so done I'm sure you can call a joke then yeah really bad guy name is I'm over by the gate I mean it's like an acquired taste with the gay so tasty

<timemark seconds="2406" />

I'm old about stranger Mammoth ski, how elegantly Segways from the tie I mean I'm all about creating Wakulla Hangman's rope on the bottom of you gay guys around the wrist so what is doing for people just listening he's talking it like towards is on the inside inside crock of his elbow and once it comes to the inside you can't get that again

<timemark seconds="2451" />

that's it I see the van sciver from there to fight over from that cuz you from then on you want to roll around in 20 years what belt is a white belt from a not so much does the average person the street is Guy Ritchie a black belt in Jiu-Jitsu they go now it seems I need you now more than ever I was well that's why when I see a guy is experienced is he wearing a tie I go maybe just super confident about no one being able to get to that was going on, ridiculous person that's what's going on I mean you have your own ridiculous ideas about owning suits I have no idea ideas about getting choked to death wearing a tie

<timemark seconds="2509" />

like I said I'm not going to LGA fishing I really do have an issue with ties okay for real it's very elegant appearance the whole thing from the top to the bottom when did you start training under who where would where were you at 15 years sex with go second down in that and then I see I went twice on the right leg and I was choked can you remember check sure I was checking that was a it was a revelation because old man

<timemark seconds="2548" />

I hope you have a Leo Leo

<timemark seconds="2565" />

Al a fancy the idea that I would not be on the mat 84 so I will school nawaza which is the ground game and they're pretty tasty we got some good use out of class so I went from kranti to judai Vols any interest in the ground game and then brought you Gracie came to live in the UK about 20 years ago and Rodger Gracie went on to become the wild Champion eight times

<timemark seconds="2596" />

and I signed taking lessons with him and his dad Mauricio then I ended up in New York.

<timemark seconds="2605" />

Do we live to a lift in New York for a while Mike's wife and I went ahead and Zoe's gym when it was about a methadone clinic and I fell in love with him so often and I'll bet you Jitsu in a serious way and I became obsessed with it for number two years since I was kind of lazy to a degree sorry I'll go blap I want to show to go to black belt and you know I know there's some tasty play Bounce out of that cuz I've lost fun with me but also drifted a bit I come in and out this to sign a few injuries but if I was training him in 5 years

<timemark seconds="2650" />

you got to be obsessed yeah but I mean I was eight years if you're a real fanatic you can get five years but it's super rare like BJ Penn got in three and almost unheard-of there's a few people have done that the other place. They they they mean it and within six months there a proper pain in the ass in the various positions in the possibilities it becomes a part of your life becomes a part of your almost like you're their operating system and as you see these guys reinforce that operating system you see their their game becoming more and more complex and build a chain attack after attack and being able to anticipate the defenses those attacks and plan two and three steps ahead you see all this play out its anime I really really enjoy watching

<timemark seconds="2710" />

I want to go from being beginning student to being killer it's a fascinating process because you were literally watching someone develop their comprehension of a language of fighting and that language of fighting is analogous to life it it helps them in every single aspect of their life because it's one of the most difficult things that a person will do in their day and you walk into a jiu jitsu School your HBU park your car you live in this normal realm of normal people see no problems and bills and stresses and issues but once you go into that thing you put on that Gigi or no gear whatever you're doing and you go into that class once you engage in the sparring sessions he's sparring sessions with skilled practitioners you're doing one of the most difficult things any person within a hundred-mile radius of you that's not fighting for their life is doing and by doing that on a regular basis and constantly reinforcing this language it enhances the all your possibilities and your potential possibilities as a person

<timemark seconds="2769" />

very eloquent, couldn't agree with you more and roll down now usually I'm usually get two or three people in my life and now there is also a black belt. It's it was an Olympic thing is a beast that's why it's so

<timemark seconds="2804" />

everyone this is a complete stop structure that on the hood. Find my phone's not even friendly, but everyone is at this whole substructure after everyone else gyms, lost my temper oh I had a reason to lose my temper is anyone ever being a bully that people of it comes to such a system of accountancy Brian that you can get away with being a bully cuz it was a bigger but I ain't going to get found out and I like that aspect of everyone gets found out

<timemark seconds="2849" />

yeah especially over time but I didn't mean if your training consistently with really difficult trading partners your character is going to be tested there's just no way there's not there's no way around it and sometimes I write a few Rich guy's penis and fiddleback play as you know the train is good Defiance a good but because they don't get outside of the comfort zone and go to a feral Jim trait that is very hung off them to really evolved where are you going to keep putting yourself in a comfortable spot and I'm comfortable James and as you said one you do that though you do see the kind of the same thing over and over again the same type of human you know you just see them in London or you see the New York or Los Angeles you see that same type of human

<timemark seconds="2909" />

sport in general but let's be specific because it's something that you and I can relate to is the wrong no barriers in Jiu-Jitsu that was looking at you if you were alright pull your Black and Whites complete come to the mat and if you can with a gay Z fighting game with Casey Lee fighting yeah I know it is a complete Clarity of vision when you find someone just write them on their ability of how they find you carry that social hierarchy liquid what's important in that school is that it is like who is proficient who's very good that is that is that's the best currency the ultimate currency at right around New York that they school cuz I was lost but now I have to get on a couple people

<timemark seconds="2969" />

Daniel currency on the mat or Claritin that you or any to any big time celebrity that's probably one of the few places where you really truly experienced that like there is no bulshit in that role I can someone's going after you and you're going after them it's 100% it is what it is all the bullshit veil of society's been removed yeah I mean on Monday to water but now it's talking back to what we were talking about previously aware that you become less adventurous

<timemark seconds="3006" />

as Eureka grows in Jiu-Jitsu particularly got it doesn't tap if you were an issue you know that was a couple of guys that I can think of one in particular but if you get the better of him and bond lodges back farther than me but he realizes in trouble Jasper. If you just moved a little bit. She think that being at you Jitsu player

<timemark seconds="3047" />

has an identity in itself and it doesn't you cannot use it as a crutch this the essence of all martial arts martial arts was about find yourself within that framework I'll be honest about it and you meet the opponent and is your man, I will tell you you'll finding it's about you fighting you in the ring

<timemark seconds="3069" />

what you want other part of the mind that we were told me about wants to say is about your reputation in the gym I want people think of you say it again you're trying to find an identity from outside of yourself by not typing and you know that feeling myself cuz it makes my game being creative is always been very adamant about that do you have to open up your game in the gym and it's the only way to really truly progressed and don't worry about being tapped don't have that ego there's a great video of him and Demian Maia rolling and they're rolling they have like when they're putting almost no like kinetic strength no explosive energy nothing nothing atletic they're just going through the movements and exchanging positions and they're tapping each other left and right and left and right with no ego it's really interesting to watch because you see like Marcelo catch Damian and they brought to a position and Damian tops and then they go through another position and Marcelo does it and it's just his real

<timemark seconds="3129" />

bassinet because we're doing there truly flowing there's no like real out here we go right they could see them do it but like when these guys to do it like as they're doing they're obviously using strength and their countering with skill but everything is very smooth and controlled and you're looking at two of the very best black belts to ever do it you're looking at Demian Maia right now is arguably the top contender in the UFC welterweight division he's going to be fighting Jorge masvidal next weekend actually which is really an intense fight talk is moss with all the Killer and then Marcelo Garcia who's probably one of the all-time greats strangulation experts ever walk the face of the planet and he's really revolutionized a lot of aspects of the guillotine the rear naked choke and I was in Brazil in South Paulo in 2003 when he burst onto the scene when he choked out Shaolin

<timemark seconds="3182" />

and to see these two guys rolling together it's really really interesting because this is really kind of how you have to do it you just do it you know there's there's no one is saying I can't tap I can't and I can't put myself in a bad position they're they're exchanging positions wrecked like right there when Damon gets under Hooks and he's goes to the Deep app Marcello's is rolling with it they're just flowing yeah but you need two to tango you can have one with an ego and if you don't go to play the game and bunkers down and screws himself that it makes a whole thing very hard to do is go to beat you both going to be complicit yep yeah absolutely yeah it's very is very interesting watching like to really really high-level guys like this role or like you know how'd your Gracie in Braulio estima or something like that and that's got a great scene there's so much top-level Jiu-Jitsu over in England right now used to be a time just a couple of decades ago where if you wanted to train it was very difficult to find really proficient in San

<timemark seconds="3242" />

action and engraved into it when we might snatch which is certainly get something out of that but it seems like the the level of autonomy there's some people that have just have one Rock Solid attack like Ronda Rousey at that rocks out of attack with the arm bar and she comes from that YouTube background that's annoying. Nasty I believe is one of the best armbars I have ever seen in MMA not just because she's with successful with it but would you watch her transitions you watch her she's able to adjust and change them like the cat zingano fight is a perfect example that cat zingano just charges outer like a fuking bat out of hell and they have this mad scramble and Rhonda realize the position that she doesn't even utilize but she says she understands armbar so well she knows why I can just throw my hip over this way and kick back

<timemark seconds="3302" />

here and I'll catch that armbar dishes just overall understanding of the position is so high level when someone has a

<timemark seconds="3315" />

and execute as bodies back and you could do something to it the level of sophistication when it's so typical Hixson that it was while I understand about the primitive

<timemark seconds="3339" />

but I'm aware I'm primitive I'm aware that my understanding of Jiu Jitsu is really quite primitive and then when you see something like that comes sneaking out of nowhere or something to what you're saying it's kind of interesting but I understand totally is I'm also primitive I know I know what I know like I understand like there's what what the hixson's language is is a series of words that you've never heard before spoken perfectly in the right order with no pauses are arms or no filler and the way he flows with it it's just he's got a level proficiency that very few other than Marcelo and Demian Maia can really appreciate that did the true beauty of it all cuz they just don't like I won't see things coming to complex

<timemark seconds="3399" />

yeah but you know enough already could line some of the other day that someone needs to know that they didn't have any brains

<timemark seconds="3410" />

so you know enough to know that you're in treacherous and deep-water say otherwise it'll be the same with that handled now you said you got your knee fixed your your blue would you say C L I see how did you get a cadaver replacement or 100 hamstring and the patella eventually gave in at the first when I was about 21 on knees bent NACA did you know about stem cell shoulder surgery and I had some placental stem cell shot in my shoulder and it's amazing and why did you have that done Vegas there's a guy named dr. Roddy McGee

<timemark seconds="3470" />

technology this involve today what was the punch of tears just stuff just years and years of abuse at my college is gone the shoutin a Mycologist about two weeks ago and now that's what I'm hearing about I'll send you and it was me and dr. Roddy McGee that we did about a month ago. He's amazing and he's he's well up-to-date with the latest technology is also very conservative in his proach to it but what he's saying is that they are able to regenerate cartilage and meniscus tissue and this is the first time anything has ever come along then actually regenerates is tissue they've been able to trim it and do things to it to mitigate pain but now they can literally regenerate tissue there even injecting it into people's discs now the discs in the spine and they're showing that they can regrow disc tissue yeah but you just mailed my three issues disc issue and College

<timemark seconds="3530" />

of course meniscus and conflige and disc what do you got going on with your back and I'm going to show you something else that you're going to need and you're going to get after we have this conversation I have a machine Outback hold up reverse hyper and it was created by this mad genius named Louie Simmons and with the reverse hyper is the machine. Decompresses your back and also strengthens at the same time it decompresses it on the downswing and then on the upswing it it strengthens all those muscles around it but it literally pull the back apart in a compressed disc switch is bad posture load of degeneration and you look up the screen this is this guy's fucking crazy he's one of the craziest people I've ever interview he was hilarious but he's a old-time powerlifters been doing it forever and he's got fake shoulders fake knees everything's blown out he has no biceps biceps are completely severed off of his arm

<timemark seconds="3590" />

what was he saying like he was he had two of his friends are making a max out bench like 5 days after his shoulder replacement he's a fucking Maniac but they were trying to have fuses discs and so he came up with this machine and you see as it swings down when she swinging down it's pulling her back apart to go to the hair growth when it's going down it's pulling the back and active decompression and as she's swinging up she's strengthening all those muscles in the spine in a real weird way where you really can't get at them and was underneath the superficial muscles in the surrounding muscle muscle around the discs and you could see the fat in it at The Superficial that's fine just say it's a lot this through your

<timemark seconds="3650" />

superficial muscles to get to your core muscles well it's just if forces that area of the body to work like you're sustaining a load and you can you lift it up and you hold it in that position and then as you let it go with bits decompressing and in the decompress cycle you you're feeling your muscles relax and you could actually feel it pulling like you feel in the lower back in a weird way you feel it kind of pulling and separating and then a couple of seconds later strengthening and again and then you pulling in separating your strength and then I have another thing out back that I I bend over from the waist on and it allows my lower back just completely relaxed and my upper body pulls down on my lower body and it separates decompresses the lower spine mean it's been tremendous huge huge asset but there's a bunch of things they can do now if you heard of Regina King do you know what that is Regina King is something that was developed in Germany that a lot of professional athletes like Kobe Bryant rotten Manny they went over there and it's a blood

<timemark seconds="3710" />

opening procedures similar to platelet rich plasma but they take the blood in as they're they're spinning at the heat it up and when they heat it up the blood has a reaction to the extreme heat like it like a thinks you have a fever so it's produces is very intense anti inflammatory response obviously if you're a scientist or a doctor and butchering this but and they take this yellow serum which is this an anti inflammatory response and they can injected into all these areas that you have massive inflammation like bulging disc and has a incredible affect an incredible effect of Peyton Manning allow them to get back to football again I had a bulging disc make my hands go numb totally went away through decompression and through this kind of stuff happened to on 40 Highway 49

<timemark seconds="3770" />

except to go up a creaky back but in the last month

<timemark seconds="3774" />

I went to Matt's lamp no money

<timemark seconds="3779" />

and I went to the doctor and get little x-ray he went well cut up right for the tenth time of operation on that night till I give you a new one in years from now or whatever it is but it changed the shoulder and he looked it up right you better find a new one to me. He wasn't a vessel to receive this information

<timemark seconds="3832" />

now the last month I am ready to receive this information as soon as we get off the phone or off the podcast here I'm going to connect you with him and he'll be able to keep you abreast of all the stuff and it changes constantly like when I first went I first got a shot in July of last year and I was that close to surgery I was trying to figure out okay I was planning my time I was saying okay if I get the surgery I essentially can't use this arm for at least a few weeks and it's going to be pretty weak for at least three months and I was really accepting that he said we'll just give this a shot and within a couple of weeks of getting a shot I was like God damn it feels better than I ever felt before and so through a series of exercises like a lot of rotator cuff strengthening exercises and Bottoms Up kettlebells like we have to stabilize the atom

<timemark seconds="3892" />

Fantastic Four stabilization muscles realize that if you're going to do something along the lines of Jiu Jitsu something's very physically demanding you have to strengthen your machine I can't you can't just keep going to just sit which is what I was doing for you had me to that was my exercise I don't think that's adequate I think you have to strengthen the machine and I think yoga is also really big and part important part of strengthening that machine because it's lengthening it's decompressing the spine and it's making you strong in these static positions which is very similar to the load is going to be pushed on those joints and on your back when you're doing jiu-jitsu

<timemark seconds="3940" />

find my price is wrong I was doing and it was incredibly painful incredibly challenging but what is rolling around in my name is it for some reason that keeps me motivated self again south yes with yoga I just haven't made it that far to access that struggle and enjoy it I feel like I'm always running on fumes yeah we've got to run on fumes but it's it's building a house one layer of paint at a time I mean it's it's not a does not an easy thing to do and I think that competitive element are you talking about is an internal struggle and that internal struggle is you and your breath keeping your breath in calm and check and focusing entirely on your breath while managing the positions and then

<timemark seconds="4000" />

slowly but surely developing more Proficiency in those positions more range of motion more dexterity keep going over and over again and then you one day you get to a point for me was like maybe a year-and-a-half doing a pretty regularly while I'm like okay now I can finally hold this position for 30 seconds where is before I literally count to 10 and just try to get the 10 and then I fall down and then I get back up and try again try to get the 10 try to get to town my feet would Buckle I need wouldn't be locked out and then I'll try again but once you develop a certain amount of proficiency then you can concentrate entirely on the breast and that's where the real struggle is and in keeping the mind on track not thinking about other bullshit not think about the gist of the struggle of life and all the different variables that you have to deal with on a daily basis thinking only of the breath the pastor in the breath very difficult to keep on track so that in Varian that's the competitive struggle that this in your own mind

<timemark seconds="4060" />

that seems this thing. That's all there is is that outside wall of the noise and what comes with that unless the internal self but everything is everything is subject to these rules yeah and yoga in the census night difference Jiu-Jitsu is no different narrative is not different is being aware of what the dynamic what's actually going on. I think is fundamental yes yes I'm Pat recognition recognizing that it's the same for yoga is for a the essence of a narrative and those things become a vehicle for developing your human potential whether it's yoga or whether she gets it and I think pattern recognition it's a date they take place in both things in yoga Hugo okay I've been here before I know where this is cuz I know I know what to do in you go right back into that thing of concentrating on controlling the breath these big long deep breaths and his big long exhales and then the focus is entirely on the breath and those patterns

<timemark seconds="4120" />

they come up in Jiu-Jitsu as well I mean that that ability to maintain breath mean I'm sure you recognize that in person just starts at one of the things you see about someone is just aren't even if they're athletic they don't know what they're doing is hyperventilating to don't know what to do they start breathing weird and they had the breath is like the first thing that you lose control over and Hickson from the movie choke mean that was the big thing that separated Hixson from all the other two player games is Yoga to make it appealing at all tomorrow shall artist that was with your wife did that's what your mom does it's what the housewives do it's not something that Amanda's especially not the top Jiu-Jitsu killer ever it was a seminal it was a seminal documentary that turned into Rockstar several times but having him in here and sitting down

<timemark seconds="4180" />

call him and talking to him about you Jitsu it's like it's like that it's like sitting down with Michelangelo and talking about art I mean you're talking about there's Masters and then there's the master of the Masters and he talked to any Jiu-Jitsu Master they all just go Hixson is the number one. Just no dispute which is amazing there's very few like there's soccer players that are just delete basketball players that are Elites when it comes to like who's the best in Jiu-Jitsu there was always this one guy and while he was competitive especially while he was young it was always Dixon which is Batumi amazing that he was able to maintain and I think one of the things about him was his physicality and his mind I think those two things in many ways were enhanced by yoga how do you spell some disc issues now that doesn't it has a quite a few is quite a few of yeah I think he has eight bulging discs which is horrific maybe you should send them to your man

<timemark seconds="4240" />

percent of me to talk to Hicks about a bunch of things Hixson though is a bit reluctant for certain kind of treatment you know I mean he's he's going to eat mangoes and fucking meditate shut up I don't know what he's up what is what he's tried or what he's willing to try but I would love to see him I mean I would love to see him rolling again it would have be amazing if they could regenerate this tissue to the point where he would be healthy

<timemark seconds="4266" />

that's the fair at the fair for the first time for me is that I've never found anybody Shave Ice Age on the mat but when people are starting to tell him a 01 going to fix it with the way until we give you a new one I know they're not Saturday night when they're saying that about your knee what is the issue is it a meniscus tissue it is a meniscus tissue to cheese potatoes difference collagen meniscus what is the different cartilage is what covers the outside of the bone meniscus is the padding essentially that's in between the two bones that keeps him from touching each other right okay so they have so it goes bone meniscus cell phone card cuz you can cut some of the doubt but when you did not have that done my last name they they did you know they going arthroscopically in the trim some of the torn meniscus yeah it's it's the it works but it gets less stable there's

<timemark seconds="4326" />

tissue in the air it's more subject to inflammation and swelling it doesn't handle the load as well but I got stem cell shot into there and I've never had a problem since it's amazing I got a problem with it for a minute or it for the first time more than 20 years ago and had an operation I think it's 95 somewhere around there and then I had another operation on it in 2001-2002 and it was it's always been an issue since then it's just one of those things that he gets sore I just deal with it whether it's kickboxing or whether it's lifting weights or whether it's Jiu-Jitsu it gets sure I just deal with it at you no take glucosamine and chondroitin and a lot of fish oil and anti-inflammatories and changing my diet helps quite a bit but it was always that thing until they shot the stem cells in there and then literally within a few months it's non-existent like I don't think I have this need a tax up anymore now I haven't needed never asked so it doesn't bother me anymore it's very tight

<timemark seconds="4386" />

tell me how thin on the witch well they've been experimenting with it for a couple of decades apparently according to dr. McGee but the understanding of the potential in the possibilities and then to the practical application is over the last 10 years has a really come to the Forefront it's really become something very very viable not just theoretical anymore now they're actually seen people regenerating tissue there seeing people were you have a tear in like your shoulder something like that in the garage and probably have to get surgery now then they shoot it in there and then next thing you know it a couple months later mean I still got some floating tissue that like pops and crunches and stuff in my shoulder when it comes to like the actual strength in my shoulder I don't worry about it at all like it doesn't bother me that there's there's occasionally some slight soreness but as far as like the functional strength of the shoulder it's like 100% it's crazy

<timemark seconds="4443" />

is this the thin end of the wedge then so is this going to this is going to turn into one of those exponential yes for sure for sure they built this woman they built this woman a bladder shut up they took skin cell stem cells from a skin and they with a p in a Petri dish they started this off and then built her a Bloodshed bladder cancer and they built her a bladder and then put it in her body and its functional it's amazing I'm in this is all state-of-the-art now and when were looking at like 10 20 30 years now me you're looking at potentially regenerating all sorts of things regenerating bone review of bone cancer regenerating lungs and liver and spleen and heart me they're going to be able to make body parts they've created an artificial heart that beats like with stem cell they've actually constructed a human heart

<timemark seconds="4505" />

this is a subject you know something about fascinated by it fascinated by it because what what they're able to do now is just a you know you're just looking into the future you get a window into this and it seems like it's exponentially exploding mean all over the world if people experimenting with the stuff and trying to figure out new ways to improve things which is to fight, having that conversation and this isn't the first time I've had in the last month about this yeah it's so it is now people are understanding and people know people that have had issues with it you can't get it in America but in in Mexico I know people that go over there and get it done intravenously and

<timemark seconds="4554" />

that's a pretty significant problems he's got the fuse discs in his neck and he had major atrophy in his arm because his disc was you know compressed and they said it was pushing on the nerves and so the nerves weren't getting it wasn't there weren't firing correctly so his right arm he called baby arm cuz right arm is kind of shrunk and so he's experimenting with a lot of things he's kind of been ahead of the curve with this stuff

<timemark seconds="4581" />

you should get Jason Statham in there I would love to you look like you fell out the same tricks that's very similar to a bunch of stuff going on with his body to I'm sure he's a martial artist fabulous and play and eat ice cream self I believe it'll be just as much and by the way get him on. And he's Off to the Races you can shut him up he's going to get I'd leave him there for 3 hours come back kind of kind of fish can you still buy you known about it it's something that he cares profanity back until about

<timemark seconds="4637" />

you couldn't who was going to say what the who because you told over one another you should give me the most healthiest I'd like to be like I want them down I play I also like with 30 lb since I should worry about 192 I say that they should be creeping around I could find a way by 178 so what is it is it a booze thing or suppose they intend to the calories itself the booze is the window to the calories itself a pizza. Pizza man but a pump

<timemark seconds="4697" />

achille well and Pop's I was Tupac's to get into the color packs crisps 22 minutes doing where you drinking a cold feed on each other before weights three times a week and finding another three times a week I love training

<timemark seconds="4728" />

bottle cap table trying to somehow reconcile shutdown 178 however it's been 5 6 years since I'll be there now I just dropped eight pounds the other day strictly I was strictly myself off the Boost cuz I'm off the booze out food in the same way the thing at the whole pup supposed to relax trouble this is what was that relaxes the rules right now when you're dealing with all these injuries how are you able to train through all the stuff you got a shoulder thinking one day might need to be replaced and knees that might need to be a strange on crack on Jiu-Jitsu whenever I get an injury I font if you stop messing around with it and pay too much attention to it it kind of dog on the lawn guy injuries I just tried through

<timemark seconds="4788" />

is almost a bluffing game that you have for the injury who's in charge of the injury and once the next few things you need to learn a lot about this stuff

<timemark seconds="4815" />

you invested and you need to be invested if you mean it is well my good friend Eddie Bravo just said his disc replaced he had to replace of the titanium articulating lower back disc so he had some pretty significant disc decompression or compression issues in deterioration and it got to the point where his lower back was just constantly inflamed to know Eddie's world-class black belt that he just couldn't keep going anymore it was before they were actually shooting in into the desk he had done about a year ago some of that you just hang on I would say with stem cells with a lot of things hang on with some things you can't hang on like ACL tears once the tear wants to the ligament is removed use nothing you could do you have to have to replace terrible thing yeah

<timemark seconds="4875" />

engraft in a left knee and then a cadaver Graft in the right knee and they're stronger like they want to do a cadaver graft they use the Achilles tendon which is 150 + percent stronger than you originally CL so you actually makes it a stronger joint

<timemark seconds="4899" />

all right. Yeah well they still stronger they when they use a patella tendon graft it is still strong in your patella tendon is a very huge tendon and you can like you can operate with a 1/3 of it missing which is essentially what they cut out when they my right leg Twitches had the two acl's I've noticed it's not your fault in this very little I can do to be felt that that's probably because you're favoring your left side and M men's yes, he is I've been looking for this yeah they can fix you up take a picture. But diet is huge one of the things about diet is inflammation and I never really rap that in my head in to see about three or four years ago I

<timemark seconds="4959" />

got a pretty significant back injury that does liquor stay in my hands were numb and it was because I was ignoring it because I would pinch it in Jiu-Jitsu and then I was going to roll light of school in their role light and then after a while I was getting bad for my back was locking up my hands are going numb when I get this pretty significant elbow pain so I started really researching all the options and what's really going on and one of the big ones that I found was diet that when you have too many inflammation-causing foods in your diet and reading too much sugar and bread and booze all these different things that affects affects like how your body. Carries fat but it also affects where your body hold onto inflammation in joints in particular all the injuries spots were way sore when I had a shity. So give me the give me the evils

we are going back to local stuff and people to degrees on the ship again yes it's take your food to take ownership of

<timemark seconds="5282" />

everything to do with a computer components of your life and it got robbed from us what happened in the seventies in the UK is oldest breweries bought up all the pubs and breweries Indianapolis breweries around old crafty bad going on and then I realized it and then he sold it back to us and I gave it back to us without character we just bought it cuz we was stupid yeah I did was happening is this we realize that character is important and local character is important than ownership is important so this is movement a 2-degree things like Instagram may have thought somebody was as a light side

<timemark seconds="5323" />

is giving a voice to the Cross movement yes I like a man that makes my food like they feel good I like it it's a completely different experience and when you're patting your food with a handmade knife it's not what it used to bait you realize I'm not should be a thing I don't rub from us do you know Steve Kramer is a guy who makes knives with meteorites yes I do not like Iron Man Came From Space Genesis of my interest in Nas with Auntie Bonine thing and there's a guy mamao See Fire Arts find out on Instagram but he just made me this Damascus steel cutting knife and a hunting knife to go with it

<timemark seconds="5383" />

and it's just I mean I caught with it but it's just I I stare at it for minutes before I cut with it I look at the blade in the handles made out of thousand-year-old bogwood like wood that was like preserve from a bog like bog Maple it's amazing this is amazing is Damascus steel if you go to his Instagram there's a picture of my knife in there you could see it hit this guy is I mean he that's it right there the far-right are those to those the two knives that he made for me that's wheat engine bog out that's what it is I don't know I just took his word for it but that's not me that's what I used to cut up Garlic also asking about we met. Damascus Gail did you have a a bladesmith face

<timemark seconds="5443" />

Jennifer you're moving she had it specifically made for the movie who plays gave me this motherfucker how to get in shape for that thing right now is a good neck like you would do those with a steel Club difficult to manipulate even a 15 pound Club look very hard work must have had intense shoulder strength and core strength UK that every now and then they stumbled across the body that's 1500 years old and they realized a deformity in the shoulders of the

<timemark seconds="5489" />

Wright's vehicle at when you pull back yeah and they used to be in English law that every Englishman had to practice for 8 hours a week to pull back a bow so you've goalie skeletons that deformed from the enormous strength on the shoulder and how so like what what is the issue with the Mets but the they have become deformed through the development of the muscle which in some way then change the phone started these massive great the finger that's her bows and arrows right and it comes from the English and the French Wars

<timemark seconds="5545" />

and things will famous for that longbows is a famous Battle of Agincourt, but then we had this machine that they were pretty Lisa with these things anyway they know how late it the entire French army Englishmen what's a chopped off fingers so whenever is history then made eloquent is it one of you show a Frenchman used to wipe the two fingers out for them since then

<timemark seconds="5605" />

Mongols did it the Mongols they have these incredibly powerful Recurve Bows would take a hundred sixty pounds to pull back and they use their thumb they would have a thumb ring made out of bone have you seen that I have a fantastic audio documentary on the history of the Mongols the Wrath of the Khan with Dan Carlin do you listen to that it's amazing yet only a fan of yours that he keeps me up-to-date on bit different things that you're interested in interested in the same things I didn't know about these big fan that he got me on to this she does things I think he got onto this because I'm sure once you hear Dan Carlin mean it is absolutely addictive but this is the ring that they would put under thumb and they would pull back like that and then they would wrap their index finger over the thing where the the thumb nail is and then pull it back that way and then release that's house

<timemark seconds="5665" />

release the arrows

<timemark seconds="5667" />

well it didn't get very far today well it did for a long time until gangis Khan. I mean they killed 10% of the population they don't know they killed so many people that change the carbon footprint of Earth to the New York Times article about how many people died during the gangis Khan's Reign that it was so significant you could see it in the carbon data you kidding no no I'm not getting chibi couple that article lady killed between 50 and 70 million people during his lifetime work directly attributed to his army and his decisions 50 to 70 million people died the conservative estimate somewhere around Thirty the liberal estimate somewhere around seventy nobody really knows what they think it's between Digger that Mongol invasion in 1200 altered carbon dioxide levels

<timemark seconds="5718" />

who killed somebody fucking people at this isn't change timer that I don't know how many people there were a lot more than a million because

<timemark seconds="5731" />

they killed they killed people in numbers that we can even in Jen I think it was Jen China they showed up in this is part of the Dan Carlin series The the shut the quiz me and shaw center like an Envoy like a party to go search this city in China and as they pulled up they thought what they saw in the distance was a snow-covered Mountain as they got closer they realize it was a stack of Bones and the roads were so deteriorated from human bodies just rotting human body they had a band in the roads because they couldn't get their cars through their their wheels rather through because their wheels were getting bogged down their horses were getting bogged down in the muck of deteriorating body has how many people the Mongols killed

<timemark seconds="5782" />

what the fuc

<timemark seconds="5785" />

I wasn't just the design for the real good question first of all of the dehumanization of the enemy I mean his idea was that everybody doesn't live in a tent anybody doesn't live the way they do these fools that live in human human they were sheep like that there was a certain disconnect between them and the other which is an imperative it's most important thing War you have decided that persons not you right if decided there the other whether it's the Vietnamese are the German the Nazis the Japanese like whatever it is you have to decide that they are less than you and they had this thing about people that did not live like they did. They were pussies these these weak people that live in the cities with their walls and so they would just fine finally cities they just roll up and they would just figure out a way to start attacking him we would like bodies on fire and launched them with catapults onto the roofs of these buildings who what was the what was the motivation it was just hunkering just conquering

<timemark seconds="5845" />

I just wanted to expand their empire and take over mean it's not there's no Noble pursuit in there is no religious Pursuit either minutes say it was expansion they encountered was subject to their Rule and they had to they had to establish that shift very very intense series now I remember I remember I do remember some of that money how things drift

<timemark seconds="5879" />

you'd appreciate this this is a legitimate samurai sword from the 1500s that's a real one

<timemark seconds="5888" />

West quad sexy time for you I don't know I mean I think that the the case is probably a modern case but that blade itself that is that isn't blade from somewhere around 1511 they think how do you get your hands on this was a gift from my business associate Aubrey Marcus a good buddy of mine and we're in business at on it together and he gave you the smartest thing quite a thing that's a real thing is no one of these blades at once you take to draw blood is in a unit in the UK call the guts to come from the pool and they have these funny little knives with hooks on the back of an Alaskan back into this. Blood on them so they've got some salad yourself

<timemark seconds="5945" />

when doesn't that looks like a pretty rigid requirement don't draw it was going to drop blood and what kind of tell you it is now that's up something about your your film I'm sure is you're dealing with a different time and that life back then although always precious the finite aspect of life is more solidified it's more obvious it's more it's something you're dealing with on a daily basis as opposed to the way we live on nothing so busy WAP quality in Spanish do

<timemark seconds="5987" />

distract ourselves by

<timemark seconds="5991" />

be comfortable live our lives that we lead and that the price for that is that we don't really accept to fill accountancy of life so we do give us sell crutches crutches taken away so different periods of time you didn't have to you didn't have the Indulgence of being else out why worry about what people thought of you because there were more important things to worry about yeah yeah there were more important things to worry about than social media you to worry about arrows swords deaf yeah instant even come back to the Mongols so what was his design if a game is designed for game with the mole people appreciate respect me and then the more I'll be

<timemark seconds="6041" />

is there anything else that kills people other than that motivation

<timemark seconds="6047" />

not like that I don't even like that I'm just right

<timemark seconds="6052" />

the whole Genesis of murder is based on the principle that someone has more power than me so I have to take that power away my comparative sense of self feels old minted if I can say that lots of way back to the same thing you already asking someone to tell you who you are and if you paradoxically and ironically if you kill them that makes you more powerful than they can no longer bear witness will they did Bear witness for a second what does bear witness is the story in your mind that somehow you are now more powerful

<timemark seconds="6087" />

or just fucking hate them you don't want me around anymore because that's threatening yes the threatening to some way it's raining in some way that somehow they can diminish your idea of who you are or you find them repugnant their actions repugnant dangerous to their society something then it's just a lemonading an enemy right or eliminating the threat yeah if you could go back I mean I've often thought about this is technology involves like will there be will there come a point in time where you can have a window to a certain era like will will time machines ever be a thing where there's a time where you can actually go back and view the past like is there a. R. That you didn't quite a lot of Google Earth on one of those I like a good porn on Google Earth

<timemark seconds="6139" />

so what are living will shampoo car house in Stonehenge

<timemark seconds="6147" />

when a plant the fields you can see where they're being burial sites but thousands of years yeah right around that area I need style fails you can say they still got Muriel Bowser burial mounds and walking out and the whole earth is littered with Prehistoric call

<timemark seconds="6173" />

flux and burial sites no burial sites that you have this thing called on the inside by which registers I mean but you'll have the same thing with registers everything on the right side everything of any historical value this map that you were the football Saul in the roads aren't everything is a highly detailed how high the mountains are on the roads and anorak for that you know what the expression I know I know it's like a geek okay you know those guys at what trains and planes and they usually wear those jackets go down and Rec Center

<timemark seconds="6210" />

typography the history of typography landscape and around my house to find his oldest burial sites that no one knows existed as long as his Google Assistant I'm confident still I'm the only person so how do you know their burial sites like what are you saying because you want you can build up an understanding of Pat recognition again you can talk about whatever it is and then to the right and then you can find one plowed field where they got rid of the mound we can still see the depressions which isn't exactly the same shape is the depressions the mall to the right and then you can build up a hole

<timemark seconds="6267" />

so you know this is the area where to get crop circles and then you can predict on burial site is going to be and it's been like finding treasure and you can go 200. In the audience at the right into it and should be about a bang there it is you can see half of these depressions runs into a wood or whatever it is but this stuff that exists and you wouldn't have known before Google came along how much work is being done on like trying to study those things as pre historical site arrowheads that happens every now and then

<timemark seconds="6319" />

there isn't much evidence that I was left behind so you know most of these things that amount about the T-Bones it but it's kind of crazy because that's an area where people have been living for thousands of years it's not like people went away and came back and now you're trying to like people consistently lived in that area like and then you see things like that horse that stone horse in the in the countryside the big man with big Willy 2 that you have these different emblems of all represented tribes or whatever so we now live in the UK or the United Kingdom but there is a legacy I mean you don't have the same here there's a legacy that that you can you can trace back step by step

<timemark seconds="6376" />

the thousands of years and we can not around the Romans I was a couple of thousand years ago when the Romans been kicking around the UK a couple of thousand it is then they went and then came the Saxons and then off to the Saxons in the French came in and then the French basically took over the UK in 1066 and then you have the couch that we have now but you can see you somehow you forget that it goes that you'll culture goes on a thousands of years and you accept it when you can have a connection to it that goes back further than that it's hard to get around the Romans never mind the age

<timemark seconds="6423" />

yeah I know what is that there's the guy with the big Willy holyshit what and how old is that it is

<timemark seconds="6432" />

is lots of that goes on around imagine that guy running that you fully erect with a giant Club how strange and there's a bunch of these and they do they understand the origins of these things they know where they came from I have no later but whole area is littered in the show of yeah and they don't necessarily know who did it or why someone like me is that you aren't going through any other conduit and I suppose it's what it is is the mystery it's the mythology of all of this road into it as an individual

<timemark seconds="6489" />

you can access it on your own on Google Earth and you think it is anyone else doing this for the sparrow song before you break from Salida bakeries and you find yourself feeling your boots with all the pastries in the world in reference to what it was that you said that if I could go back to any time

<timemark seconds="6519" />

about to come back for a minute long I see the. That we're living in is the most exciting. To live on this planet I know no lie so because of what we've been talking about stem cells is that going to be the thing that allows you and I to age more gracefully than without so much pain

<timemark seconds="6547" />

we have enough wealth that we can live a comfortable life if you decide if you choose to live a comfortable life we have medicine that we never had this. In history it is

<timemark seconds="6565" />

we're still complaining but if we could just remember what we are comparatively where the position we are in history comparatively it's an into compliance yeah comparatively for sure is interesting to when you talking about this the use of technology and how what you can do now with stem cells and comparison the passes are cuz it's really exciting emerging time but similar like the use of Google Earth to discover these mountains and things we see what's going on in the in the Amazon now they're discovering evidence of civilizations that were just rumors and myths like the gold City the ancient Gold city that there's that what is that movie that they're doing the lost city of Z yes they're finding these established irrigation pads and City grids in the Amazon jungle thousands and thousands of years old and they don't know the origins they don't know who was there they don't know why they're constructive with the culture was like but this was all at 1

<timemark seconds="6625" />

point I'm just mythological and now they're realizing like no no no this is history and this is there been told and passed down and he's fables and now I understand There's an actual this if concrete a physical grid brother that you can go when you could see I know these are real cities that did exist and the jungle is sort of engulf them it's taken over them so amazing I mean it's allowing this is only step one I think Google Earth is going to give away to some sort of a magnetic resonance type thing where they're going to be able to look deep into the ground I think what we're seeing now is your you going to be able to eat right now we're exploring the surface of the Earth and we're finding all these characteristics that allowed this is a body or this is a burial area this is a pathway that was probably irrigation but I think they're going to be able to come up with technology that allows you to do the same thing but look deep into the ground and then I think you're going to be able to find all kinds of crazy shit the same way they can understand like the complete

<timemark seconds="6685" />

Topography of the bottom of the ocean now if you look at some of those maps that show the ocean and literally shows the depth at every state your I think you're going to be able to do that deep into the surface of the ground they're going to be able to discover all kinds of crazy stuff someone keeps opening that door what are you saying we got to get going this is why I don't allow people to come ruin it a perfect God damn, you got some other commitments I guess I'll I do I'm selling a film when is it off this weekend not this weekend next weekend so that is 11 units to get it back in an hour to Avis. This weekend is next weekend is that May 12th just a weekend off Guardians of the Galaxy so I believe that is made at 12 right

<timemark seconds="6742" />

excited about it I like it I bet it is you got a crazy business when you decide then I'll just leave you with this when you decide like to commit to an idea I'm sure you have a gang of ideas bouncing around your head to feel like what makes you just go all right this is the one let's run with it like the magic lamp

<timemark seconds="6772" />
