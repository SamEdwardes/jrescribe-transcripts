<timemark seconds="297" />

you going to drink that Andrew be very careful 270 mg of caffeine that match Margaret. Is that allowed in a pot of coffee I don't cup of coffee and then on top of that he drank a venti with a shot of espresso from Starbucks with Altra all doing it while he was fasting so halfway in the podcast she starts curling iron in the bathroom throws up then comes back and then throws up in a bucket at the end of the podcast literally didn't didn't make it out of the room so they heated seat if you had to take a shit we have a caveman coffee nitrogen ated is basically like espresso with nitrogen in it

<timemark seconds="357" />

human you can sneak up on people that's the point man my daughters about so about a year ago so they had enough of the beard so it had to go when I was when my daughter was one friend of mine died and we on the internet we all had this guy Evan Tanner who is the former UFC champion and we have decided that we were all going to grow beards for him cuz he had his crazy giant beard and so a bunch of us meeting her at it and I just grew this fucking werewolf beard and then I got to a point where I was like you know it was time to stop I was going to shave it off and my daughter had no idea what I really look like so I shave my face and she started screaming she thought I was somebody else and start crying this is my normal face and she's confused like who are you that that's what it looks like that all night with my boys they were they were young to like so they never seen me without it so like they thought you were a stranger

<timemark seconds="417" />

see that that's because it we're on TV I trim the cheek areas cuz it could hit creep option to GQ to try to look fresh

<timemark seconds="427" />

well I have to admit the fact that after 30 years of not having a beard meeting you right ended up with that beard and then started speaking Arabic I don't know where do you know when you're lecturing electric circuits guys who have lived your line of work I don't know man it's like counterculture so anti-establishment in the establishment so that's part of it you know and like anything else you get into I don't know if I felt normal right so it was like a probably crash a little bit and something felt right for a long time I don't think it's a crutch but I think it's definitely like a mark of the

<timemark seconds="475" />

the occupation dick marchenko book talking about guys who dress that just how they didn't fit in we like regular military guys not in with authority not in with you know everybody being the same way not down with uniforms not down you know using name and rank you know it's loaded by the first name girl hair longer beard wrong or just kind of a earned that right you know what I mean so that's part of it like hey I earned the right to be able to be autonomous so so to speak and so that's kind of some of it it is interesting you know that that's the I mean I don't want to make distinctions but the baddest motherfukers in the military are the ones who dress like

<timemark seconds="535" />

like just regular Savages is something out about that right I don't know man it's just got to learn it and do you know if it's like you get so tired of doing what you're told and you want to do what you think you need to do for the job you know what I mean so like what is it how how do I see that I need to accomplish this task whatever it is I don't need to be dictated from somebody who's not going to be there telling me how to do it and try that goes all the way down to even like okay well what kind of boots am I going to wear what kind of what kind of uniform do I need to accomplish this mission to do these things I just kind of that's the way those guys are there always thinking about you no not not how to fall in line man but like how can we think differently to solve problems and Athena of the uniform is just one of those things is very interesting just so this is a stand-alone podcast of people don't have to go back in

<timemark seconds="595" />

do the first time that we did we have dr. Mark Gordon here good friend of mine and Andrew Marr who is the founder of the warrior Angels on the amount co-founder me and my brother Adam are who was also in and we did a podcast a while back but for the people that didn't hear explain what the warrior Angels Foundation is and what you guys do yeah if I get some contact show at church Joe so why we talked about I was Special Forces Green for about a beret for a better part of a decade do you know so I would say somebody to find by my vision of the future and so that always let me to doing what I wanted to do in life and so green no special forces spec ops type dudes there in life and death situations pretty regularly and perform otherwise I don't live you know what I mean and so that was kind of life for the better part of 10 years being in life and death situations on a regular basis and so going from that you know I would say a high performer

<timemark seconds="655" />

you know by every metric to one day after my last appointment I woke up and I was on 13 different medications you know I couldn't remember how to drive home from the same route that I've been driving home everyday I was just in chronic pain all the time I had these balance issues why couldn't walk in a straight line blurry vision would go into double vision and I have these horrible migraine headache so just a bill at aiding that way and then sorry to have become depressed and this was like this was just mind-boggling to me because I was leaving I thought my life's purpose right doing the job I wanted to do with the people I'm going to be with married to the woman of my dreams and the family that we always wanted but yet here I am I have all these physical problems now I'm sorry to be depressed and I don't have a reason to be depressed and then I started having panic attacks in public in our weight room at home in front of my kids you know like just breaking down

<timemark seconds="715" />

find and not knowing why and not being able to do anything about it and and then I started to have you know and that was again like my the structure of reality was fracturing around me and I didn't know why what was going on you know the first thing you can think to do and something like that was to drink I was like I got to I got to stop this and I don't I don't know what to do I think I have some screws loose or what's going on but all I know is this is so disastrous maybe if I just drink I can I can put the put the brakes on this little bit and and and things just continue to get worse and then my behavior just continue to Skyrocket out of control and it wasn't like I was making conscious decisions to be fucked up like I'm driving I'm drinking and driving on a regular basis and I never even crossed my mind like that was a wrong thing to do it was just like hey man I can't function unless I drink and I got to drive so that's what we're going to do you know

<timemark seconds="775" />

and then start producing just horrible effects on my family with that line of behavior and it got to the point and a special forces operator man all you want to do is operate all you want to do is be on the team and go and do the things that we signed up to do didn't have any problem with that. It wasn't like you know all these combat scenarios are weighing on me and spend too much and I just can't handle it's like that's what I feel comfortable doing it back to it and but again like I never had any of these symptoms before so life is just spiraling out of control and not sleeping and everything else and so finally you know you sit on it till you can't sit on any longer and it got to the point where I was like I'm not only on my detriment to myself and probably Society like I can't go out and operate right now like these guys can't depend on me

<timemark seconds="827" />

and so at that point I was like I got to raise my hand and I got to get some help and you know that well-intended people wanted to offer as much help and financers as it possibly could but again all I got me was 13 different medications and I was told hey you've had so many head injuries you can't afford to take another Blow To The Head And this is probably going to be the new you you're going to be on these medications take a pen and a pad everywhere you go and and learn how to live within these new parameters and schedule out your meds and this is this is going to be that and so it was a medical retirement it got so bad Joe that my wife was 9 months pregnant with our fifth child

<timemark seconds="872" />

and she had to ask me hey Andrew can you keep your drinking down today in case I go into labor so I have to drive myself to the hospital you know so that's how bad it was getting and that was enough to stop me and so she actually our son had a genetic lymphatic malformation his neck and you got sick he's like 13 months old and it got infected and it blew up like the sizes of a softball and it's when she's 9 months pregnant so we have to take him to the emergency room and my cat have been killing me for about 3 days at this point I didn't think anything of it I just wrote it off but we're in there the emergency room like he's having trouble breathing like it's it's bad like a softball on his neck well he turns out he has to go to emergency surgery and then Becky goes into labor so he's up on like the 5th floor getting emergency surgery back is giving labor to our youngest son on the second floor so I'm going back and forth between the 5th floor on the second floor and I'm like dragging my leg at this point

<timemark seconds="930" />

cuz it just stopped working but you know I was all-in and refused any care till I get these two taken care of well we get Jace out of surgery you know he's on the road to recovery get down for the Earth we have our son JoJo he's good to go and then it turns out that they finally rushed me to Imaging and I have a blood clot in my leg and it's broken off into both lungs now have a bilateral pulmonary embolism and at this point there like a man like we have a very small window here this is very high mortality rate and I'm like laughing at him cuz like you know I was drunk at the time no bullshit and I'm going to kill me get in line this is just a long line of offenders hear that. I want a shot at that butt so anyway so I'm sitting here in the hospital room and I'm just wondering and waiting for somebody to come explain to me like how life is spiraling out of control like this and like somebody's going to say hey this is a reason that you have these blood clots

<timemark seconds="990" />

here's what's going on with your head and all these things and it just it never happens and I remember like I got to go down and visit my son who is in emergency recovery

<timemark seconds="1001" />

and I was there at his hospital bed and I had a a bottle of whiskey or airplane bottle of whiskey I pop the last pain pill I ever took and I shot down to Whiskey I was just normal 24/7 how I operate at that time try to just a coat and I had this Epiphany you know that hey if I continue on the same track and I continue to just wholesale buy everything in medical system is is telling me it's going to kill me and it's going to ruin everything that I love so I can stay on that route or I can decide to act and to change what I don't like at that point it was everything and so I made the promise to my son right then and there that I was going to do some things one I was going to get off all medication and I was going to return to the man of my pre-injury status

<timemark seconds="1052" />

to I was going to find a way to kill myself and then three I was going to turn around and do that same thing for somebody else and so right then and there and hospitals bed and I mean this is honest-to-god true story I said I don't care how I don't know how but I've had enough I've had enough of people telling me that my life is over and at that time you know my identity was in Special Forces and that was taken away because of medical injuries and I said I don't care anymore I'm still a husband I'm still a father and I'm going to get better and that was enough to pull me out of there out of that negative spiral that I was in and the start being proactive again and start being defined by a vision of the future in my vision of the future was just what I said and I didn't know it was going to lead to where we're at today but that was the Catalyst and so I started going to looking for alternative therapies and it turned out like the government didn't want to pay for anything that wasn't cover

<timemark seconds="1112" />

by their insurance wow that's fine I'll charge it maxed out on credit cards that's fine I'll get more credit cards I don't care I don't care if it's a million dollars I will get the money and I will get better and I will solve this problem and that's like an objective about it and I was like you know talking to everybody out there was haven't had problems like what's working for you guys and I got real interested in why did some things work for some people and then not work for other so you know Savino precursor to meeting Mark I'm starting to get really scientific minded are in a 1 of jective data to be able to support things and so there's all this these other treatment modalities out there and I did every single one of them and some of them were little bit of benefit in the short-term and some of them you know reversed or made symptoms worse but it was leading to that that we got some some publicity out of it Mark read about it and just contacted me and he didn't know anything else about me at that point

<timemark seconds="1172" />

but he said hey you know we've been treating TBI for a number of years now here's my credentials here's the background story on it here's some media that I done and it was a podcast that you guys have done a couple back with a when he had Matt Dodge Neon and I'm listening to Matt tell his story and for the first time ever through hearing him I was like holy shit this is this isn't specific to me like I got so wrapped up in myself like I thought like the whole world's on pause and this is this is this my problem and I realized oh my God this is a much bigger problem that has wide-reaching repercussions that doesn't just deal with me specifically and so as I'm here in Matt talk about all the problems that he's having it's like he's like to tell my story to the teeth and then I hear Mark save will not only that but we can identify an underlying condition for all of the things that we were just talking about and we can measure it

<timemark seconds="1232" />

actively and like that just blew my mind cuz I was like here I am on 13 medications and there wasn't one objective measurement where somebody said let's put them on antidepressant depressant let's put them on another antidepressant let's put them on a anti-anxiety I was like there's nothing objective about that I was like wait a minute so that there was nothing you're saying there's nothing they were measure that we need to do yeah based off the symptoms and the complaints I had it was just throwing darts like I said 13 medications I know from a person who never had any issue before and to all the guys that have served that have gone to this kind of thing and not just guys have served but also when you're dealing with TBI we're talking about athletes were talking about 4 more Fighters that I've been in contact with on a regular basis have these issues and what Mark is done which is been just phenomenal was open up a new door for treatment to these people and I have talked

<timemark seconds="1292" />

so many people have been in contact with so many people that heard about you through the podcast we've done together and heard about your work and have gone on to completely remove these medications for my wife correct. That's a problem in Psychiatry is there are no real biological markers they're trying to use a radiographic study was like spect scans MRI pet scans and what have you as rationale for starting people on medication but there's absolutely you know when the biomarker the biomarker panel that we have a direct correlation between someone having had head trauma regardless if it was mild or a blast from like Andrew head or a slip-and-fall or someone coming up and hitting you behind the head or MMA or Fox tight and there's absolutely zero that they used to regulate what to do when it says okay today is Thursday let's try this drug for this is Friday or else this month we're giving you this Satchel of meds

<timemark seconds="1352" />

how many of the vet said come up and told me depending upon the day of the week dictated what groupings of medications they were given the underlying cause of all this it's related to TBI great question and the answer is number one from the head trauma that leads to disruption of chemical processes it's like you know the old alkaline batteries or the car batteries were used to put distilled water into it well if you put Coca-Cola in it totally changes the ability of electrons to be conducted just like in the brain so the chemistry of the brain is altered by the information and it starts shutting down systems so that the nerves in left side of the brain can talk to the right side or the frontal lobe of the brain can talk to the temporal lobe of the brain so you have disruption of executive function which is your ability to make correct decisions about things

<timemark seconds="1412" />

right and wrong why do we have over a million veterans incarcerated about how to respond to an aqueous approached by an individual that they don't know and they respond by a salt or with physical or anger or yelling at people and that leads men to jail or into incarceration so anyway the information leads to hormonal deficiencies in the brain and what we found is that there is it since 1986 dr. Ballou out of Paris found that we have enzyme systems that take cholesterol in converted into hormones that regulate our brain function from schizophrenia to ALS to Parkinson's disease to bipolar two different disorders that was a recent article that I sent out to our Journal group in Andrews in it and was about management of anti of information brain inflammation to treat psychiatric

<timemark seconds="1472" />

can the past 6 months we've been starting to see a lot of Articles talking specifically about inflammation creating all these things that we're trying to treat with medications that are ineffective I last month how to class in Arizona and I presented a group of Articles and one of the key articles was a fact that they found people with atypical depression that's the person that doesn't respond to traditional medication so you're on whole bunch 13 medications and you still depressed so they found in 61% of these people who were still depressed with atypical depression that the head growth hormone deficiency and then when they replace the growth hormone within 1 to 2 months their depression disappeared and they had some beneficial side effects they slept better they had more mental energy they were socially more adaptable and their reactive scores that creates you know when assault situation they work on so it's it booted them

<timemark seconds="1532" />

who do you as opposed to getting into their face so it's a very clear and it's becoming clearer and clearer in the literature around the world now we've been doing this since 2004 and information is really the problem so unfortunately there is no specific medication they talk about use of aspirin and ibuprofen in things like a house on his disease which is an inflammatory disease I know I shared it with you in the past that if a football player has one concussion on the field he's 19 times at greater risk of developing Alzheimer's between 30 and 49 years of age because it's an inflammatory illness

<timemark seconds="1576" />

it's not an old genetics by itself there are people with genetic predisposition to it because they generate this thing called beta-amyloid but trauma and kind of trauma to the head can elicit increase production of beta-amyloid lead to these problems so the the traumatic brain injury causes this information and there's a there's a process that goes on when the brain is dealing with this information and that's what's disrupting all of these normal functions executive functions absolutely and we have different that regulate whether or not you're going to be, or you going to be hyper as have anxiety one of the products that we use a hundred percent natural about 80% of our treatment is all natural products with 10 to 20% being pharmaceutical products but no psychotropic are brain altering medications so what kind of products do you use to glue on 6160 articles talking about it's beneficial effect on

<timemark seconds="1636" />

Society so we have people come in on a multitude of anxiety medications within 3 months they're off all their medication there what is cholesterol the first, change the cholesterol becomes pregnant alone which goes down one pathway to become testosterone and then down another pathway to become cortisol which is the anti-inflammatory product so we get benefits of Pinot anti-inflammatory effect by having pretty long but if you're on any kind of Statin drug that decreases the availability of cholesterol in the brain or the body you lose I've heard nothing but bad things about statin drugs don't get me going I want to get you going well is there so many people that have this very meager understanding of cholesterol in a meager understanding of like what is the difference between having you know high cholesterol low cholesterol what do you know what is healthy what's not healthy what's your cholesterol mark

<timemark seconds="1696" />

my cholesterol is 350 my LDL loose and it should be according to the present standards less than 200 my LDL cholesterol is 273 my which is the LDL is lousy kind and my HDL which is the happy to have the healthy one is like 23 to 40 how did the numbers change over time in my medicine back in the late 80s it was 349 and then went to 322 79th and 249 229 in less than 200 now we would expect our nutrition is changing the quality foods that we anticipate that the rate of cardiovascular disease should be diving getting lower

<timemark seconds="1756" />

percent of all heart attacks happen in people with normal or low levels of cholesterol so the question is then what's causing it what turns out inflammation you start looking at inflammatory chemistry there's a group of inflammatory markers that we have which sdldl homocysteine LP little better than cholesterol heart disease and what we do in the office as we have a biomarker panel for a cardiac inflammation person comes in that got a history of elevated cholesterol when my closest buddies Keith Spyder pilot his cholesterol 140-150 my cholesterol 300-350 we went had ultra-fast CT scan that looks at the heart and his calcium score was greater than 2000 which is it's a hundred or less is good greater than 400 horrible mine was zero and I had a cholesterol that was three times his so after he had his open heart surgery

<timemark seconds="1816" />

new Vic are arteries put in we wouldn't have this paneled call Dan lp6 my cholesterol Sky High but all these inflammatory markers low and keep situation his inflammatory markers with Sky height even though his cholesterol was very low there's a simplistic understanding of what what's causing these issues in people pay get on cholesterol and you hear it so often so many times and you like boy how do I even begin having this conversation with people I would like to if even if anybody's listening and you want to really get into this dr. Rhonda Patrick went pretty deep on it in the last podcast we did and the newly found connections between refined sugars and refined carbohydrates and saturated fats the combination of the two seems to be a gigantic issue where a saturated fats on their own or not an issue the small particle versus large particle LDL small-particle LDL which ones

<timemark seconds="1876" />

call the pla to in the blood which causes the sdldl the small density held the L2 fracture into two parts that cause the immune system to be called in and once the immune system gets their it creates all this information and it's something that happens with LDL when you combine it with refined sugars that's extremely bad for you extremely bad sugars corn syrup things that people drinking a soda and cake and bullshit all the refined bread and wheat products all that stuff is fucking terrible for you was just add more information yeah it's being conflated with saturated fats and with cholesterol and it's it's not what the issue is correct so think about if you have a brain injury and you're eating like that Rice like you're hungry and having no idea what I'm so inflammation response and then there's also the the

<timemark seconds="1936" />

issues with the pituitary gland and the hormonal deficiencies it's it's not only signals to the testicles of the ovaries to make their hormones of the adrenal glands but it's the fact that the week on glial cells which are astrocytes and neural cells which generate their own hormones and it turns out that the hormones produced below the neck has a genomic effect on the body which is slow it means it turns on genetic switches to do things but the hormones produced in the brain called the neural steroids they have the mediate effect because they influence the membranes of neurons to do things so our ability to be rational because you're taking different parts of the brain and they're all working in unison as opposed to having the section that deals with you know how you respond to someone talk in a high voice to you or pointing a gun at you or pointing a pencil

<timemark seconds="1996" />

so you lose that integration of the different parts of the brain that's what kind of each of the lobes are responsible for his how we integrate signals coming in that the whole thing is so fascinating cuz it seems like there's so much to understand and for the for the average person that goes to your general practitioner and the general practitioners says all get high cholesterol you need to be on a Statin drug and then you find out about all this people get extremely angry I've talked to so many people that were on statin drugs and suffer also to health consequences because of that and then realized oh what about cutting all the fucking sugar out of my diet what about doing doing all the stuff that has been shown in all these more recent studies that have a significant effect on personality it's unfortunate that one really good science that it takes another 20-30 years before it gets into the medical community and there's no obligation for general practitioner to me up on this.

<timemark seconds="2056" />

constantly and that's what has me in frustrated State all the time is because the science that's been sitting on the bench what I do I take the research that's on the the bench that's already been done and I look at it in large groups and then applied into the clinical practice and that's how we've had our success is because we've taken the stuff that's sitting there to be used that's not being used because we're in the Paradigm of don't do anything for 30 years I mean every generation a little bit something better happens but if it takes 30 years it's it's incredibly frustrating so Andrew please go back to how you found out about Mark and what changes you made and what happened yeah well cuz I'd only known you since you been happy but if you

<timemark seconds="2117" />

ruins all the hormonal production correct brighten and so that's not understood but so I found me I looked into everything I would just saying whenever it listen to listen to that researched did my own research system and ran it by my own people and so I went saw endocrinologist I was sonar me at this time and I was saying hey do you think that any of these problems were based off of the you know hundreds or thousands of explosions that we've all round on her on a routine basis he's like no I don't think so and he was like I was like what can we test and replace any hormones that I'm missing because I mean at that time we have done some test I knew that I was deficient in things and he's like I'm going to test you for anabolic steroids because I think the reason you're having these problems is you're abusing anabolic steroids and if you pass the test and you prove that you're not on anabolic steroids which will take about 4 to 6 weeks and we'll talk about it replacement treatment program and I was not right

<timemark seconds="2177" />

and I got told he accused accused me of being a going to him yesterday or Rolaids and so you must be abusing anabolic steroids are here simply trying to score drugs and what you're saying when you take anabolic steroids your natural testosterone shuts down a lot of times when people get off steroids then they go to a doctor there natural testosterone to shut down and they'll go to a doctor to try to get hormone replacement therapy because the only way a doctor's going to give you a hormone replacement therapy as if your levels are low right then so one of the reasons for having low levels is that you've you put all this exciting this shit in there and it's your your whole body is all confused yeah so thanks for clarifying that Mark like

<timemark seconds="2231" />

he was like hey man you think I'm coming in here putting all this personal stuff on you but I like I like to make things up just cuz you want steriod cuz I want steroid once it's done taking my life the disaster you know what I mean it happened it happened twice Joe twice what it's understand that there's other issues that cause your body to have low testosterone that's what's so this is Justin this direction man so I was like well I said that that point I started reading some literature and it's like it's not even black I mean it's not even in the gray area this is black and white there's like a blast drama type of Thelma's and pituitary gland and down-regulate all these hormones and so anyways so I finally I link up with Mark in Southern California the labs we don't get the results back for like 2 or 3 weeks but he gives me a woody call the provocative testosterone injection just to see how I react and like at up until this point man like my life is just been

<timemark seconds="2291" />

complete disaster I mean I put a gun in my mouth several times and and actually had thought about like it is how life is going to continue and I continue to have this type of negative effect on my family I think I'll just end it man you know what I mean and and I got to the point where I was just like I can't do it for my family alone and just kept driving so found Mark Mark found me you got the information next Tuesday to see him in his office in Encino get that injection I'm driving south on the 405 I'm in bumper-to-bumper traffic like 2 hours later and usually man like me in traffic just didn't mix and it to say that that I had a hostile temper was like understatement of the year and I realize like hey I'm all the sudden I'm cool I'm calm and collected I'm not having any issues I'm like whoa I don't feel any anxiety like the last year-and-a-half I like had this fist like coming out of my stomach man like at all times 24/7 was horrible and it was gone

<timemark seconds="2351" />

and I was like if this is any Taste of of what could be this is incredible and I call my wife and we have a conversation for like an hour and that's the first time that we had talked more than 2 minutes in like a year and I didn't say yes or no cuz I just wasn't capable of anything else at that time and so fast forward for a few weeks from the air you know he gets the report back and he's like hey man you're deficient in everything you know but we can we can fix this and so we get on anti-inflammatory protocol and we replace replace the and replenish the hormones that are deficient or insufficient

<timemark seconds="2389" />

and life slowly and surely started to turn back on little by little by little by little to where I'm at today I'm off all medication you know I'm clean I'm sober performing as good if not better than my pre-injury status we started the organization called The Warrior Angels Foundation to deliver this same level of healing to other people who in the exact same predicament and situation and now I'm excited to say Man 3 years later we've deliver it to over 200 people with Incredible results Owen meets with the scientific criteria we can predict we can measure and we can replicate and now it's not just my story it's not just mad cause he's Tori Mark's done this like 1400 times we've done it 200 times throughout our organization or somebody like we did a three-year TBI study cohort we took 58 about those two hundred people just the ones that I can attempt at suicide 58 individuals attempted suicide we had we showed that with

<timemark seconds="2449" />

and 3 months they have what was it 91% out of 50% Improvement correct so almost everybody had at least a 50% this is Nurse objective analysis Improvement after 1 year 90 C70 3% of that population was off all medication this is unheard of this is unheard of and this people that wanted that actually attempted to take their own life I need a minimum of two times in our study so we are word for producing results that I've never been annotated before you know what I mean and it's through the scientific model that marks come up with this protocols some believe that our website we got the we got all that research on her website to so they must have died but I got more credible media page a library of all this information that didn't exist 3 years ago it's now all in one location and all the sudden I'm saying here please don't take my word for it you guys go out in fact check it and I can't tell you how many

<timemark seconds="2509" />

come out to me after shows that have either been in contact with you or I've been in contact with other doctors because of the information that you've given out and it was so thankful and so and there are you changing people's future you're literally giving them an option that they didn't know existed they thought they thought their world was black and then you open the door like oh you can be okay when Andrew first came to me and you wasn't the first veteran that I've seen the first guy that I took care of was in 2009 he was Active Green Beret and in North Carolina Bragg and his wife I knew she was emergency room doctor and she called me up and told me about her husband getting ready to get less than honorable discharge after 4 5 tours of Duty in Afghanistan and she explained it to me I said let me send you a kid so I sent the kid out and we got the results back I told her what to do she put them on to treatment he lasted another to sign up for Zurich to tours of Duty and was doing phenomenally well

<timemark seconds="2569" />

the key that drives me on this is guys getting back into life going to Pepperdine business school now guy who was attempted school 5 times and the 5th time he was on her protocol for 2 or 3 months he ends up getting honors and now he wants to go back and give back to the VA for them not having treated him optimally fight going sociology to try and help them to understand what he had gone through with us of guys who are on in Wall Street now and I mean all kinds of a prestigious their wife's back they've got their recalling their parents and they were able to come back and make their own their own choices they get their life back on track is such a giant factor in this whole equation that people need to understand it's not just about motivational

<timemark seconds="2629" />

beaches it's not about memes you put on your Instagram page that make you feel better about life it's literally about the chemical balance in your physical vehicle and if it's off you're going to be off and if it's all because of diet it's if it's all because of injury whatever the factors are you going to figure out what those factors are not correct them you got to correct them before self-help before all that bullshit correct your diet or whatever is deficient in your hormone levels whatever is deficient in your nutrient levels it's so goddamn important information as you just said Physical Fitness and Nutrition you know my daughter Allison is a naturopathic and she works with us with the warrior Angel Foundation to help with getting the gut-brain

<timemark seconds="2679" />

NSYNC so that you don't have gluten she don't have all the junk we talked about because they generate the poor nutrition generates more information that passes through the gut into the blood into the brain that is actually there was a study that came out of was on the BBC's last week where they were talking about whole we finally figured out that if you have peripheral information like disease like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis that the information goes into the brain and can cause depression that's been in the literature for 30 years they finally are starting to understand that things that happened on the freaking affect our brains functioning so nutrition very important is part of what's going on to just the human body is so insanely complex and there's so much to understand and so much to do you have to kind of be like you are you have to be obsessed with all the stuff I think I was obsessed you're obsessed but okay okay what you were you're doing that was just it's it's so important and and so it

<timemark seconds="2739" />

there's just so little of it out there for people this is part of the problem is like you have to really go looking for these Solutions I mean you got to go through every door and every channel and try to find out and so many times they want to offer you some sort of a pill some sort of a pharmaceutical drug it's some sort of an anti-depressant anti-anxiety medication and if that one doesn't take to give you an anti-anxiety medication on top of the anti-anxiety medication fuck we had lunch or dinner with the Admiral in Virginia Beach beginning of this year one of the stories that he was sharing was the fact that his wife was diagnosed at a VA has having a thyroid related issues so they started treating it in the course of treating it she felt worse because they weren't giving her the Ampla mount replacement hormones so the next thing that the doctor offers her is an antidepressant saying the reason why you still not feeling well is because the antidepressant and won't

<timemark seconds="2799" />

statue in checked out or hormone levels for hormone levels were off today even check on my condition like in somebody tell me what that is I know we got we're managing symptoms but can we do that and we do it objectively or scientifically and that's the beauty of of of the protocol because again to break it down a TBI it's a two-phase injury Phase 1 is that physical trauma or assault explosive blast way blunt force trauma acceleration acceleration slip ball roller coaster anything that causes that anti-inflammatory Cascade to start permissive environment so if you don't have a good internal environment like you're eating a bunch of processed foods sugar you're leaving just a low quality of life making poor lifestyle decisions those things harder like compound

<timemark seconds="2859" />

first overtime are being like low-level blast ways and it could be something as simple as one of those you know hey that's enough that could cause inflammation of the inflammatory Cascade and then that causes the hormones to become deficient or insufficient that's what we found through our research at least our that's what I research suggest is that the process and if you don't get rid of inflammation or bring the body back to a balance if you don't replenish or replace those hormones that are lost you're going to have all the physical and psychological manifestations that we all know about and talked about and so that's a deal can we be objective yes we can can we measure it yes we can can we predict and replicate well we've done it 1400 time so we can so now it's like okay well how do we continue to take this to the next level to make sure this goes mainstream you know disseminating information on platforms like this for working project

<timemark seconds="2919" />

government like right now we think we might be able to actually affect change on a real level here in the next few years it's it's so incredible that there is finally some sort of a resource that there's not something that people could turn to but we need to lay it out like there's it's got to be every point right it's got to be nutrition scary exercise got to be reducing the information it's got to be replacing the hormones all those things together when an individual is suffering with symptoms I call it symptomatic TBH I don't really agree with the term pts or PTSD your pdss especially when there's a history of traumatic trauma trauma to the body or trauma to the brain yeah it's not necessarily I think people think of it as like stressful situations arise been through one of the things that I've found in talking to a lot of guys were operators is they don't have like a high stress level because of what they've seen like they're the there were the actors they were the ones who were doing the thing

<timemark seconds="2979" />

is there a lot of the stress level comes from a lot of the guys that were not being proactive there waiting around for something to happen to them and those are the guys of the most affected by stress disorders the guys were wondering when they were going to be attacked where is guys were operators who wear out their aggressive out there being proactive that they're doing it they had less of stress meditation for them going out and killing people are on the offensive I can speak from experience here you're on the offense if you're not waiting to get on there so when you're stuck in this what it is is a fight or flight mechanism you know what I mean you're on security mode in a non-combat environment and so these guys get stuck in these fire flight modes and they can't figure out why why am I in the fight-or-flight like this dis off of the situation does not call for that type of response and then you look at it like if you're deficient in these things what's the body going to do if he's got these mix

<timemark seconds="3039" />

electrical signals or their shearing of neurons it's going to come out as a fight or flight mechanism and that's why they're stuck in this and that it's called post traumatic stress but when we've tried these so-called psychological issues as a physical injury and replace and replenish lower the inflammatory Cascades guess what those symptoms resolve themselves whether they were whether they were on the defensive or offensive you know what I mean that's fast 9 how about there's definitely a psychological difference between someone who becomes a CEO or Ranger or Green Beret there this document yes there's a there's a difference in the mindset and you know those feels people are some of the most important people we have in the planet correct that you have to have the world you have to have the elite of the elite you have to again people don't understand that you need to go to some really terrible places in the world and understand what's out there

<timemark seconds="3095" />

you don't look across the spectrum of special ops and then the regular army we've talked about this in the past the pattern that I've been seeing also in in civilian population is those people who are more a type get better faster they want to get better as opposed to the people who really don't want to get better or is that a time and time again if you have a clear vision of the future and it's like hey I'm going to get better like I don't care what anybody else says like they like we're like the 10th stop that they've come to that we tried everything we just found out you guys were going to do something let's get this going but those guys get better not. Not to mention of course objectively we can we can push to look at it but people come to us and like I don't know why it doesn't work out and everything goes my way I hope this goes but I'm not getting my hopes up everything else those people will talk themselves out of getting better and I wouldn't believe unless I seen it time and time and time again

<timemark seconds="3155" />

put a gun in their mouth and pull the trigger you know what I mean unfortunately we've lost people to do in that and it wasn't like hey we got we got you the help and then it was like well it's such a hassle to take the medication at the prescribed times and I'm like what what and then I looked into that and like that's a thing called non-compliance like the glaucoma Research Institute study like 60%, patients don't take your medication on time no one that that will cause him to go blind cuz I needed to I need to justify losing some people that I couldn't I couldn't wrap my head around then like why won't they be compliant they people getting this distal rut and they memorize these emotions and they getting this negative fucking place man and Dave Dave talk themselves right of Life find NPC come super comfortable with repeating these really negative patterns they get coffee because they know those patent it's very disturbing

<timemark seconds="3215" />

you see someone who's you know I grew up with a lot of guys who had drug problems and when you would see they would get hooked on Coke or something like that and get off of it and know that they're on a better path but it's pulling them back in and not even physically like the process of doing something that's fucked up and ruining your life somehow or another becomes more comfortable than the process of the unknown which is improving your life it's tit scary people. Yeah the structure of the brain through neuroplasticity and that can be their new status quo right how you get people that are in that mindset how do you get them free of that I mean how do you get someone who's this whoa is me and never works out you know is there a way I mean is there a tried-and-true way I wrecked my health I wrecked my health risen but we've had a couple of guys who had stop

<timemark seconds="3275" />

the protocol because they didn't feel that anything was happening from it and they send me an email after they've been off for maybe a month or says cheese I don't feel as well maybe it was working so far they say that we're working with the devil in all kinds of weird looks better

<timemark seconds="3300" />

NetZero they say what they want to pay job motor vehicle accident one disability check yet I stop taking PPI case it's unfortunate that people that have real personal injuries that would like to get better

<timemark seconds="3317" />

I talk to everybody I filter in but generally speaking I've cut down I just come to the conclusion you know like hey I can't make the decision I can't make anybody get better you know what I mean like all I do is give out the information can someone shoes on and make him go like you're really really made myself oh my god do you know we're going to lose the attitude and my effort and I can push out this information to the best of my ability and people going to meet us halfway you know what I mean like there's nothing we can do to make somebody want to get themselves better talking with the guy tomorrow is his brothers at wit's end and just wrecking everything that he comes in and out of a rehab program just is up is a horrible place it seems I don't see it ending well and I'm a talk to you tomorrow cuz he wants to know how can I make my brother when I get better and I'm like brother

<timemark seconds="3371" />

I love you man but we can't somebody you know what to do that and that I would have fed disaster I don't know that the tragic part of that I think is you know the person's not thinking right cuz they're their judgement clouded because of a head injury you know serving the country it's it's it's it's a bummer one of the battles that we have also is that relationships I speak to wife's that are estranged husband's that are estranged when we take on a new veteran patient to let them know that the person that they've been dealing with post traumatic brain injury is not really the person they want to be that's an effect of the hormonal dysfunctioning so they're depressed or angry there you know they're difficult to be around so I tried to get them to help in the protocol to get them better and what we've seen her couples getting back together we have a 77 year old Vietnam veteran who lost everything he's back with his kids now he's out and back

<timemark seconds="3430" />

chopping wood in Boston you know just that's the reward that really is the reward but people have to understand that if they've had traumatic brain injury anticipate change in the person they're not no longer the person that you anticipate how long did it take you for that transition well it was started first having symptoms like 6 months after I got home you know what I mean so that's the difficult part like you're not missing a limb so you don't think anything like we are rocking and rolling come back good to go happy to be alive let's get ready for the next one and then boom stuff starts happening is like oh my gosh what's going on you know but you can't see anything and you just keep going these keep his seeing this low quality of life and then you want help and you can't get help you ask for help if you're getting medication start drinking sleep it's messed up nutrition gets mess

<timemark seconds="3490" />

Star Trek in relationships then start thinking about I'll never be able to do what I thought I was supposed to do nobody understands me what's the future going to be like like this you know and it doesn't get anything that's how you get trapped into these memorizing these negative States cuz you stuck in that for you you heard mark on the podcast how long did it take you to act and how long did it take after their two for you to become who you are now it's so I made that decision at my son's bed side and that was several months before I met Mark what year is this how many years ago is 2014 - 2014 and I didn't meet him until December 2014 right so it was all a 2014 or just a disaster right leading up to the hospital scene so I made the decision like hey at that point it was like you know what I've always been to find my by my future

<timemark seconds="3550" />

well said and like you know like being a Special Forces Green Beret with my mask we all wear masks and that's a lie. That was my Identity or at least I thought it was and so when that got taken away from me it was like what I'm going to do now and now I'm sick and now my children are sick and now they're telling me like I have a brain injury like what is that mean like that this is like this Kid Rock So like being Rock by circumstances knocked me you know for a year-and-a-half just that knock me and like I wasn't prepared I wasn't ready. I did not a deal with it and it was until I made that decision that I was like no I've always been defined by going after the future that I want to create I'm going back to that and it was like so there was like a will you know that was to it like I don't know where it came from but like I could observe my thoughts and I was like these thoughts that are being produced now or not me I don't know where they're coming from but there's a will inside it says we're going to fight this and we're going to that we're going to find a way to come out on the other side so that happen

<timemark seconds="3610" />

and in September do you know fast forward to finding Mark so it was like a quick like after 3 months of the protocol like physiologically I felt like myself again I was off on medication everything else yeah how long did it take you to get off the medication did you play some Miley eye doctors at a place in my life that I was like hey I am I accept whatever Fallout could happen but whatever I'm going to feel it's not going to be artificial I'm asking to feel whatever it is and I'm an animal to deal with it on on my terms I'm not as Beast zombie doubt it was rough bro was rough so I can I was off all medication before I got to Mark you know what I mean and so I didn't like how I didn't have control of like my mind the way I wanted to like the way I do now so it was but I had to work very

<timemark seconds="3670" />

hard Not Just Lose It On people friends since like we were with my wife were in a fast food restaurant picking up some food for my youngest daughter and so I'm going there grabbing some food I see this kid teenager in the parking lot and I don't know this kid throws his cup down he's cussing is causing a scene I feel like I need to intervene I don't know why so I'm like hey man pick your cup up throwing the trash quit the only cuss words that we're families are here and it tells me to go fuck myself and I'm like dude go pick up your stuff and put in the trash and he said the same thing and before I knew it I just backhanded this kid Cross of face drop them on the ground and then I picked him up I threw an oncoming traffic of Jesus will the parking lot took offense to that right is right right right Lee so you know what I mean and so I got people swarming Macy's next thing I know like I dropped like 3 dudes in the parking lot and I look up after dropping the last guy and like my wife's breast feeding and three of my children are looking at me and like there

<timemark seconds="3730" />

would like horror is on their face just the horse truck and I'm like oh my God mad if I don't get control of myself like not only is this going to possibly kill me I'm going to kill somebody else you know what I mean like I had I felt like I I just I don't know what happened something happen if I came to and it was like dear God I just dropped at parking lot and I'm doing evasive maneuvers in my fucking minivan trying to be funny but not but not funny you know what I mean so you know it was it was this process of so it was Ruff Ruffman off medication I don't recommend it from anybody for anybody else but it was like a man like I want off of that cuz I just made me a zombie drooling on myself as far as your diet and exercise and then marks protocol you know basically try to anti-inflammatory diet you know what I mean that's just based off my individual needs at that time

<timemark seconds="3790" />

I just remaining active so let me buy anti inflammatory. What did you do differently refined carbohydrates getting away from things that were packaged for me you know what I mean going back to more wholesome Whole Foods or after I'm on it do you know what I mean so I didn't make any changes until I got up yet protocol started to like return to to normalcy and then when you get to that level you start feeling really good again you like what what else can I do you know what I mean and that's that's like been the steps that we've seen so many people like we don't have to make any Lifestyle Changes initially like they'll make them on their own so get them back to homeostasis a balance and arrow permissive environment and Marquez Mark calls it and then you start looking at like what else do I need to do in my life to optimize it in for me man it was like

<timemark seconds="3850" />

take a look at Water I'm going to be take a look at light sound EMF like every external you know stimulus I want to optimize and make sure like it's is optimized as possible while so did you do any changes to the way your exercise let me think about that not really man I was kinda Olympic lifting at the time and stayed with that physically always remain Physically Active through the whole thing so not a problem blood clots was the level of cardiovascular fitness that I was in at the time you know what I mean so yeah but yeah that was like no one go to like I just always worked out I always been that's always been a part of my life and so that was always there so stuck with that so 3 months in how did you feel what was the difference

<timemark seconds="3906" />

I felt might and a different no more anxiety no more depression no more balance issues no more double vision no more blurry vision no more migraine headaches no more memory problems like back on like I could go back to operating in the Army and 33 disabilities according to the VA hundred percent service-related disabled is what 33 what were they kind of psychological disorder that you can think of like double-digit like I was given you know what I mean depressed anxiety insomnia so like psychotic all all these different things and then just a whole host of physical injuries as well that have been talking it over time but they're just like 33 disabilities hundred percent disabled missing a beat man I'm not in any chronic pain I don't have any symptom ology of any of those things and we that's not specific

<timemark seconds="3966" />

special to me right like Mark how come we've been able to take so many dudes come off of their pain medication without going into withdrawals like that that's if you need to talk about that that's crazy Matthew was on 16 medications one of the medications was Oxycontin he was on 80 mg a day he was a morphine sulfate 240 mg a day he was on Fentanyl patches and in 6 weeks no patches Fentanyl patches on top of it every anesthesiologist that I run by with what he was on said the guy shouldn't be walking you flew down from shipping from Washington to charge you know he had his draw shrapnel out of the left side of his head in his right leg was shot and that's the reason why they just fight all his medications 6 weeks after starting the protocol unique for him based on the biomarkers he was on two medications a year later he's off

<timemark seconds="4026" />

those medications and he moves to Hollywood to become an actor in a screenwriter truly function no paint that more than anything else no but the question was I started seeing this pattern is Andrew brought up getting off of their medications and no withdrawal so I went back to the literature and started seeing things about condemning all A and B receptors that you more the opioid receptor Alpha and beta the mule receptors and it turns out a lot of the things that we do modify it and modulated and then more recently talking about pregnenolone which is that mother of all hormones that comes off a cholesterol where they're using it in people who are addicted to benzodiazepines which are you know Valium and so forth they have side effects from being on such a high dose where they're sleeping all the time they can pregnenolone and decreases there fatigue during the day it turns out that way

<timemark seconds="4086" />

Gaza pens work on the sink all the Gabbie receptor which is one of those relays stations pregnenolone is what is what should be given instead of giving someone a benzodiazepine so that's how we've been able to get all our people off of anti-anxiety medication is with this pregnancy off because of how it functions and it's all out there I didn't invent anything it's just reading the literature I love the same cell receptors same receptor called a benzodiazepine receptor on the Gabba hey that's crazy man and like they're on pain free no pain Nunn & Co. Coming off the meds with without withdrawals like that did they put you on tramadol or yeah that's a long time ago because you've been off of it what are the things that disturbs me the most about this is what if someone like you wasn't around like what your ear kind of an outlier in the medical community that you really

<timemark seconds="4146" />

gravitated towards helping soldiers helping people TBI athletes football players Fighters what if you weren't around I mean I'm not hearing about this from a lot of guys right 2015 when my second third book came out on traumatic brain injury when we started giving classes very inexpensive classes for Doc's to come in and get trained so today we've trained specifically on the technology about 400 docs and they're going through a process of training and exams and so forth before they become part of our Network it's wearing Foundation Network so that we can disseminate the information and have more people involved with this is it such an important thing and it's such a common factor for so many people that are suffering from depression and anxiety and all these different issues that very easily could be attached to traumatic brain injuries or and and people that don't even think

<timemark seconds="4206" />

hydromatic brains used sub-concussive trauma there's there's a lot of people that have just done they just been bred to how to knock knock and Tumble rough-and-tumble life and then I'll realize it but they've caused damage to the brain we see we have patients would come in under our wellness program and when they're asked have you ever had any traumatic brain injury they say no but you look at the mile markers and you see the pattern that they've had head trauma and then they say oh yeah when I was 18 dearth No 53 years of age or 47 years of age oh yeah when I was 18 I was in a car accident and I hit my left side of my head against the driver side window I did not wasn't knocked out and have nausea and vomiting and you think because of that that your immune Will turns out that 85% of all traumatic brain injuries are called mild for reason you don't have any symptoms as some people might have a little bit of a headache you know or feeling fatigued but for the most part they feel

<timemark seconds="4266" />

nothing then there's 15% that make up the moderate to severe were there in a coma for periods of time we've actually had people who are in a coma some vets who have been in coma told Connors who is told that You'll Never Walk you'll never be able to take care of himself he'll die young and so forth guys married and he's walking his bicycle riding on on what is a Facebook these shows his pictures and so forth I did listen this guy couldn't walk they told me wouldn't walk again who got three guys like that still shows damage and they want the gray matter of the white matter in the white matter but he's made new connections and so now that's why he's able to do it because of the protocols allowed him to go back into the neuro permissive environment so what does that mean that means that you can experience new things Branch rewiring itself even though there's physical damage to certain lobes because he can rewire itself he can get better he's walking

that's crazy all the hormones that we talked about that relates them as gender hormones male or female reproductive hormones sex hormones it turns out that each one of them has a secondary function testosterone stimulates the immune system to increase the white blood cells to the CD4 and cd8 Witcher the protective kind of white blood cells it also decreases the information in our body called a t h one section of the immune system and stimulates the anti-inflammatory estradiol progesterone pregnenolone allopregnanolone they all function to improve Alzheimer's condition so if you're an elderly male or female with low levels of hormones in your rent it up to you know cuz you were once what about the interpretation that's that's also where your unconventional her a standard means

<timemark seconds="4383" />

which I've looked at it from a shift hormone X whatever it is has a range of 10 to 90 so you go to the doctor and you get the blood test and it's 15 and you got all the symptoms as though you're at flow 10 and the doctor says you shouldn't be having any symptoms because you're within that range that we called the reference range but it turns out that not all of us are identical genetically and function very well at that specific level of 15 so what we do is we bring people up to what's called the median 10 on the bottom 90 on the top yet it together to get 100 / 2 and that's the statistical median so we move people from that 15 all the way up towards that 50 and some people hit 20 and say cheese I feel better 2529 and then there's a population who have had the greatest amount of head trauma traumatic brain injury where they need to go up between 50 and 75% and we still keep everybody with

<timemark seconds="4443" />

the normal physiological range as predicted by a traditional medicine classical medicine and that's where we get the benefits and that's the reason why a lot of these guys have had a missed Opportunity by their Primary Care doc to improve them is because they are still functioning on the old Paradigm which in 1975 two major biostatisticians came out with these two books that are like 8 pounds each and all they talk about is how old is science all this chemistry that we do for people that it doesn't apply to you and I had applied to the people that were part of that studied set the standard range or the reference range because I wasn't part of that group so my what's normal for me wasn't part of that what the guy said was the two guys said was what's best is to develop your own reference range based on your body

<timemark seconds="4500" />

and he should do the same as I've been doing over the past 60 years so a guy comes in and he's an 11 and they tell him what he's normal so what we do in the provocative testosterone testing in the guy and I also do it in females is we test the theory out okay if it is the case I'm going to give you a shot what did you say you felt like for 60 hours Cinderella Cinderella on the 405 talked to Becky for an hour and she told me the story like she was in amazement that is. She didn't think it was after they get their injection they send back 5 days later this questionnaire that says how well they did in big letters in the area that's for comments he says I felt like Cinderella after the ball

<timemark seconds="4560" />

and 60 hours he was just cruising were using physiological dosing of testosterone I don't believe in you know everybody comes to the office is not abiding bodybuilder so we give physiological dosing because if you give it more consistently they get a better response so he was given 60 mg of a blended to Stash from head of phenomenal you had a good response could believe the crazy thing is we're talking about from 2014 where in 2017-2018 now it mean we're less than 4 years and all this changes happen correct that's what's amazing that you started the warrior Angels Foundation that you have help so many soldiers since then that you've gotten the word out through your foundation or dealing with a very short amount of time and so many people have been how to this amazing extent correct and you know we asked people I have to hear about us and thank God that we had heard it back into 14 on your show the first one so many people

<timemark seconds="4620" />

committed to me look at you see Joe would you thank them for us we have listed list of people who would like to thank you for the fact that you and I believed in what I was doing enough to to have us on the show The First Time back in 2014 for the first time like I sees to it never ceases to amaze me every week I get just a ton of mail for people who are there for the first time like I didn't I didn't think there was any solution out there man I think this is a really good time to do this again as one of the reasons why I was excited about this is good the podcast has grown exponentially since that's all it's much much the D on it is much larger now so I think we're going to be able to effect and help a lot more people so for people that are interested people that want to find out more information and then they want to try to help themselves what's the best apps

<timemark seconds="4671" />

well so we set up the organization we had such a outpouring because of all the media like it was an overwhelming almost to give to everybody so basically what we do now as we Grant Millennium Health Centers so much money and we're help to subsidize cost like that so they'll go with our grants to Mark's facility will go there they will fill out information through his website which is milenio ctbi med legal.com that's TBI Med Med legal.com to fill out a new patient information packet put in all the information there then they can be seen that way and let me tell you this about Mark every time I go to treat it to visit him for a doctor's visit he won't let me pay you make bets make pay for other soldiers six patients out and he goes let's pick some guys out you're going to pay for them

<timemark seconds="4731" />

the corporation are Corporation Millennium Health Centers Inc has a fund and what it does is it under writes a portion of the veterans and then Rachel Foundation underwrites another portion of it so you know Revenue that we get from the sum of the product I'm selling so far it goes to help pay for it to pay for Joe but we found it they they need to have some skin in the game you know what I mean that that enables like us to be halfway so again we subsidize the rate or we made it to Fort like it's affordable. But now it's really affordable insurance not taken for a whole host of different reasons but so we made it that way and so now like we used to handle every case individually with the warrior Angels foundation in and find them in and I just a hippo mess and I never thing else so now we found them directly and then work to subsidize these rights make it affordable so we could help more people get treatment and talk about that about

<timemark seconds="4791" />

skin in the game and how important it is just psychologically for people it seems like if you give people things for free they just don't appreciate it as much as you make them work for it it's it's unfortunate because there's a lot of people that really will work hard for something that you don't have the financial means but there's so many that that applies to but if you just give it to them they don't appreciate it it's too easy come to easy very few people have responded that way the Vets have been really good they've heard about us from either your show or from one of the shows were from their colleagues who are in the program and I see how well it is and they look at the hell dismal their life is right and they have a choice make a choice you want to live the life that Andrew had in the past or the enjoyment and the love of life that he has now and how can someone like me donate it's on our website W aftv.org it's a 501 c 3 so it's tax deductible and you can go in there on top right

<timemark seconds="4851" />

is the donate we have a film coming out called quiet explosions top there you go

<timemark seconds="4861" />

that that's our trailer right there so we got an Emmy Award winning director here's is can you play that Jamie Go full screen

<timemark seconds="4872" />

the average blast wave travels at 163 miles per hour it says

<timemark seconds="4878" />

Jesus

<timemark seconds="4881" />

that's great that you got to see this video folks of people that are just listening to the podcast you got to see the impact of these blast explosive so any type of Entry that we need to get into some place that was denied for whatever reason. Or whatever I was the guy who would Place those charges to get us in

<timemark seconds="4910" />

you're not the person that you used to be I can't remember things driving home I don't know where I'm at five years I've driven that route every day also they look up you don't know where you're at

<timemark seconds="4922" />

taking myself to wait on the pack and it's going to kill me or I can make the decision to quit blaming my circumstance and decide to act

<timemark seconds="4935" />

and says in 2014 you met Mark Gordon hormone deficiency in suicide are connected

<timemark seconds="4954" />

a lot of this is for the people listening to something you need to see it just a lot of the text on the page talking about the benefits of this and how much it's helped Andrew and

<timemark seconds="4967" />

what is the name of this video Jamie so people can quiet explosions and we just started production this month right Mark yet this month and so if you want to donate to that you can donate their that also be a tax deductible donation to do it three different stories all people through the foundation so we have two other credible stories and then the top mines in in science in neuro Endocrinology in the Neuroscience neuropathology are talking about traumatic brain injury and the protocol so it's kind of a concussion you know what I mean identify the problem where identifying a solution so not only are we bringing up for the first time ever you know what is the real underlying condition behind traumatic brain injury here's a solution here's all the science behind it and here's the specialist in their field confirming you know what the literature has been saying and so we have to bring that out in 2019

<timemark seconds="5027" />

do with it when you bring it out or just to disseminate information absolutely on school right now it's going to be distributed to disseminate the information that's it as we have more potential individuals were suffering listening to this we've been training doctors we've been getting through multiple avenues for the military through the different divisions getting them on board supporting us the Navy SEAL Foundation is supported us that's all we're trying to do and we've got enough Groundswell in our population to justify it as Andrew said multiple times its reproducible predictable and there's something that I want to impart here this is stigma with men in particular in this country when it comes to hormones and replacing hormones are very embarrassed by it

<timemark seconds="5086" />

like it it disturbs them and they start to think of it as cheating they start to think of it as steroids they they look at it in

<timemark seconds="5097" />

ideological way and that a logic away is connected to I think in my opinion the stigma in our culture that are attached to performance enhancing drugs like for Cheating in sports in the Olympics and you always hear about them to sort of negative way so there's a lot of guys that they shy away I've talked to many friends are very smart they did talk to me about testosterone like to have it on testosterone for 10 years and make it changes your life changes changes the way you function I'm 50 years old my body functions like it did when I was 30 and that's a fact it really does and I push that mother fucker all the time so I'm not I'm not telling you this from just the theoretical standpoint I'm talking about from the physical action perspective and I tell this to people and you see go in one ear and out the other I don't want to take any testosterone I don't wanna I want to go to a doctor that's going to get me human growth hormone and I don't want to look at my hormone levels and like but you're depressed and you're tired all the time and you're you're trying all these different

<timemark seconds="5157" />

things are taking Zoloft you're getting magnet therapy I know people have gotten ketamine shots and all these different things to try to cure depression like why don't you look at your fucking hormones man here I can look at it does mandate that they have to take it and I should know I should know more what marks talking about is your physiological optimal level right and then that hypothetical scenario he gave earlier if you're out an 11 you know what I mean and you're just once you know point above normal with that completely different sliding scale to measure that but to me would like be taking of jective analysis and just get a snapshot of where that's at and like maybe to see what it would be like to push it up a little bit and see if Weidman prove you're not a knotted supraphysiological right physiological based on you and all the healthy level and I'm great are you had to push it really high

<timemark seconds="5217" />

show Different Strokes for different folks what I'm trying to figure out is why would someone rather take a psychotropic medication then fixing what God has given our body to manufacture that because of trauma because of genetics of whatever your not producing it at the level another fallacy for me fallacy is that as we get older it's acceptable to have lower and lower levels of hormones well how about this the reason why they're getting lower and Boards because the shity food you're eating the fact that you had 60 years of traumatic brain injury which of interrupted the brain's ability to regulate homeostasis to regulate your hormone production that's the reason why

<timemark seconds="5256" />

the levels are lower so bringing it back to 25 to 35 years of age which is been the victim in our office for the past 27 years has been keep up my testosterone up a bunch is cutting out processed carbohydrates all the refined carbohydrates that you just jumped at like 50% like it doubled it I was like this is insane right so it tells you how important about chemistry is of the Buddy of the body to regulate other aspects of it and the diet and exercise and sleep and all all these different factors but when I saw that my my testosterone a bump top and then ultimately doubled I I was so confused as to why it took me so long to figure this out that eating pasta and bread and pizza and all the bullshit was having an effect not just on like body fat but it's it's having an effect on your whole body being able to process all these chemicals you got to think of your

<timemark seconds="5316" />

Chavez machine and people don't like to do that but think of your body as a machine if you have a machine or an engine or any extra thick of it as a vehicle you're going to have to need spark plugs you need Coolin right you need gasoline you'd always been different factors and if you don't have the proper amount of engine oil if you don't have the spark plugs aren't working right the vehicles not that your body is far more complex than a car but similar in that respect you've got a brand new Porsche 911 Carrera with four flat tires choose one of them to fill up and drive you're not going to be able to before Cardinal harm hormones of our body and I see colleagues of mine who only focusing on one hormone how are you going to be able to have a nice level ride if you don't look at all for the key hormones

<timemark seconds="5371" />

and also the insanely complex way that all these different nutrient levels and hormone levels can interact with each other and that they're all a part of this incredible system that takes forever to just scratch the surface of understanding I read a lot I've just scratch the surface of understanding what's going on and I'm not sure I understand it it is so complex but when you see the results you know that at least you're down the right path way it's a symphony you know that that's who sings Artest immediately like the big one was the not needing a nap in the middle of the day I just assumed that I would get up I would eat breakfast in around 3 or 2 o'clock I need to crash testosterone deficiency does that and then write the shity processed foods and then carbohydrates I came off all protocols at 2017 for

<timemark seconds="5431" />

7 months for this year just cuz just because I wanted to see what would happen when I thought like the brain and body went back to the nerve emissive environment in the hypothalamus my pituitary gland would turn back on but wasn't the case we had no two laps to fold up but I had to prove to myself I guess I'm emotionally spiritually that you know I could slay that dragon and I could live life without it but it wasn't it was no by no means imagination optimize do you know what I mean and then when I went back on it man like my body composition changed again and I noticed increase energy and and I thought I was doing well but I was like life is better I'm a better person when this is optimized and didn't so me know I've proven to myself that I can do it without it but life is not better I mean cuz of it we might be looking at sometime in the near future where they can do something genetically where they can alter the way your pituitary gland functions are some of the different with crispr with maybes a genetic manipulation tools that there were there working on right now but as of right now

<timemark seconds="5491" />

that's not the case

<timemark seconds="5493" />

you have to get tested and then replenish back to physiological levels all the hormones out of select all of them of doctors that you trained that you you trust their work that you can recommend is there a way that people so don't have to travel to California to meet you on the website sears.com has a under

<timemark seconds="5529" />

TBI networking training it has a list of doctors we've trained doctors in Spain United States Canada New Zealand Australia I'm going to Southeast Asia to train a group in Cambodia and Vietnam for a project which is to establish centers in southeast Asia because there's a lot of retired vets there a lot of retired vets to set up Center so they can offer treatment if you look at the website it's listed all in alphabetical order we have California there's Arizona there Colorado floor company names on it are people who are in the process of getting their certification so there's a 4-Hour exam they have to take and pass it with at least 70% and then present to case of showing they have the ability to utilize the information so there's doctors available in many many states

<timemark seconds="5589" />

Goodrich people at scale in the same way like train trainers are trained doctors yes or working on with the government right now what's incredible is it how much you've accomplished in such a short. Of time that's obsessed yes you driven driven better obsessed. That's good but like for the right reasons and like opportunity just continues to go active let's go out there let's make things happen. He said to me in the beginning we're going to be doing the right things for the right reason and what'll happen is things will shake out of the trees and land in front of us and that's what basically has been happening we just you no money

<timemark seconds="5642" />

stop the issue just skip the the work done in the response and the reaction of the Vets with a reaction or response been incredible as far as like what I've heard and what Woods come to me about it and hopefully work shaking that fuck you helps promote our book and give us a blurb for that so thank you for that at Tales from the blast Factory supports what we're doing that comes out next month if anybody's interested in that matter fact we did a thing on Amazon Joe and then get it for $0.99 so we won't be able to get that beautiful beautiful alright so any closing thoughts do we need to get out there if these people

<timemark seconds="5688" />
