my gas today is one of the baddest motherfukers ever beat the drums a very cool dude I really enjoy talking to him and probably one of the most famous rock stars on the planet Earth give it up for Travis Park

<timemark seconds="285" />

The Joe Rogan Experience

<timemark seconds="293" />

Boomco Travis going on thanks man thanks for doing this guy's arms not fall off me and you you have so much repetitive motion I've never understood how you could do that just barely coolest thing like right up like a fist from your face that we go I always do battle ropes okay that I must constantly like I'll do 30 minutes you know not high intensity the whole time but just keep my shoulders and arms moving as I prepare for a tour but yeah I think my wrist my wrist probably have gone through the most hell over the years like I just feel like just normal people's restraint that probably don't have cuz there's been so much grinding like they pop in the Box

<timemark seconds="353" />

fast-twitch muscles are really don't get tired. It's amazing like cuz she's so many people have repetitive stress injuries and I mean even Secretary's Day get carpal tunnel you know people get who write a lot get carpal tunnel thumbs from their phone too much when I smoke cigarettes I was feeling kind of the first symptoms of that stuff and I wasn't drinking a lot of kind of a dumpster on tour you know not really taking care of my body and I could really feel it and then are you still vegan yeah and you run that restaurant right was Crossroads or it's one of your one of the owners renting it is saying a lot I couldn't do that I shouldn't have said running like old punk rock hardcore guy like new John Joseph Joseph last time he was in town with them next time I'm going to make it down there

<timemark seconds="410" />

I think probably 89% of the people that eat their on vegan cuz it's that good yeah that's what I said that so I think for Dana to be able to sit through it and enjoy it and Matt Serra think he bought everyone for like I don't know if it was like fight companion was like one of those white looking for a fight YouTube Joe yeah I was on tour but they FaceTime you from there but yeah towels like a g he's the best vegan Chef in the world by far how did you get involved with that already you clean your diet up because of your your injuries or because you were trying to keep your body tune for drumming or you just wanted to clean it up. Yeah and then

<timemark seconds="460" />

after my accident I was in the hospital actually long long story that that I'll just sum up and down in the hospital because they didn't have any other kind of vegan options of protein Shawty bags of beef jerky whatever they would give me whatever I could stomach and not like kind of like to think about what I was eating cuz I wasn't eating at all and I was just ditching my food giving it to my friends cuz I didn't want to eat any of it and I got caught it's a long story short a little bit of meat is in the hospital and when I got out I just felt like the next evolution of my eating wood would try and be vegan and it was so easy in La cuz we have so many great vegan restaurants so yeah that was so when is that the best hardcore bands in the world to ever ever do it and tell approach me they're saying hey I had this idea for a restaurant really like to beat you know you to be involved and I said say no

<timemark seconds="520" />

just tell me what you need cuz I know you're out before reaching out to friends and family cuz he was he was Oprah's chef and he was Ellen DeGeneres's chef and he was all these like you know really high-profile people as vegan Chef when they would you know do a vegan diet for however long some some forever some just like a two-week thing but I think you just got to the point where you want to do something for himself and then Crossroads was born and I knew how good he was so I just told him say no more tell me what you need from me and I'm there and then it just you know it's been 5 years now I know a bunch of people that have eaten there and that they loved it what's not because of me it's because a towel in his food for sure yet Alan Scott the sheet at the chefs there just you know the best

<timemark seconds="580" />

were you in the we just wanted people promoting it like how Hands-On were you with the construction of it or nothing would like the decor anything he would run stuff by a second check this out tell us what you guys think of this as you know there's basically menus change every season so it's not the same menu all year long so as we prepare for the next season's menu is like testing it on us the you know the season prior so have you bring it out dishes and and letting us try it but yeah he sure it's the whole thing that's when he gets his food when he's preparing food is he getting his stuff directly from Farmers like how it how is he getting his food directly from you so he has to curate these relationships these Farmers into Skype go to visit them and find out how they're growing their food yeah and and you know you'll be all set with a menu if it's fall but then those same vegetables are in season so he has to rethink everything for the next season and not kind of repeat himself

<timemark seconds="640" />

it's really he's really got it down to a science and how long has he been vegan for

<timemark seconds="645" />

I don't know how long has been vegan I've never really asked cuz it's got to be incredibly difficult to be if you can shove I would imagine being a regular shaft is difficult but when you put all those restrictions you know when you have to make things taste interesting and indifferent and yeah I think that's where Chef Scott comes in cuz he's actually comes from a meat background so he was working at Italian restaurants and tie Mediterranean restaurants that cook everything so is infusing this vegan obviously like lifestyle of eating with you know Chef Scott Stacey as well so I think he had a think that out to where it would appeal and and mediators would be there too and not really notice a difference cuz I agree you know sometimes when you go to a vegan spot and I'll take my bus driver ran or my whoever's travel at me and you know that they can't stand it Crossroads is not one of those spots where you're thinking about like man I might not enjoy this meal there's some good spots in LA

<timemark seconds="705" />

red spots ever go to follow your heart in the valley all the time yeah that's the spot close to home that I love like follow your heart shout out to Erewhon everyone has that good vegan options Chef Ito who has a spot in downtown called Avec who took a vow of silence 22 years ago

<timemark seconds="724" />

yeah what are the special man yet 22 years ago took a vow of silence and he's done no more talking no more talking what in the fuck is that about so we just communicate if it has a lot to say or write it down but you just read the lips and I know what he saying but he shows up to it that's so crazy he takes a lot of photos on playing he's in the pit with his camera the silent guy who doesn't say a word yeah and it's his cooking is phenomenal so but yeah la or spoiled with great-looking trip 22 years of no talking yet he also does like this juicing where this year he juice for 189 days with no food

<timemark seconds="771" />

wow what are you get down to I think he was he lost about 20-something pounds he does it every year wow yeah he's trying to write cannot talk I don't think I could do it in a minute fasting is like as much as I can do I do that every night but that's the valve science freak me out yeah I've never really pride and kind of like asking bunch of questions why I write a lot that too but no I've been around when people ask him he just said he wanted a time out for 22 years yeah that's a serious fucking time out how old is homeboy he's got to be probably in his 50s so almost half his life yeah what the fuck Christmas with me spend Thanksgiving with my family and I know that's cool but everyone Smiles at them smiles

<timemark seconds="831" />

he just be sitting there all silent like that any noises as a whistle

<timemark seconds="843" />

no I've heard him snort one time when he was laughing hella hard but that was about as close as it gets so he doesn't laugh out loud like hahaha wow audience member that would be rough happens once a year where you have a bunch of them that basically you know that are basically Marching for the March of silence for the cruelty of animals and whatever else so yeah I'd like to have them on the podcast to see how long are you talk to him for so strange it sounds cool I mean I love this people like that out there though I'd love hearing those stories excited the guys you know something about that makes you go wow I was talking hella loud when I first met him through the pain

<timemark seconds="904" />

you know no one didn't introduction going a disguise silent I'll just tell you know I had no idea really loud and if you like. Just Whispers to me like a mouse to me I can hear you and I was like okay and I just figured out overtime wow silent by choice yeah that's having some very strange like that he meditates I think he has like a lot of kind of Buddhist kind of qualities I kind of I think if you had a lien in some kind of religion or practices would be that wow that's intense. That's a serious commitment man I could even imagine 122 days without talking a day I think anything I think we'd catch ourselves it being very hard I was going to get my tonsils and adenoids removed because I have sleep apnea

<timemark seconds="962" />

cuz I have a fat neck but I found a mouthpiece that I can sleep with that keeps my tongue from falling over cuz I have a when when your neck is thick your wind hole is small believer knock some more muscle you put in the smaller your whole gets and then have a big tongue when you lay back you can actually block your Airway wow and so friends that I know I've had their adenoids or tonsils removed in they actually take some of the soft tissue out of your your passage way so you can breathe easier but the problem is you can't talk for like 7 days I do rough for you a man that the internet phenomenon has the same problem starts up here is yours works its way to the shoulders tonsils out is a it's a bum out I did that did you did you have tonsillitis

<timemark seconds="1022" />

I was smoking weed right like but I would smoke Backwoods like I love the woods so is everything 20 back was a day easily yeah and I was recording an album with the transplants and I turned a skinhead Rob and I was like yeah I think I think I have something like something is lodged in my throat I can barely breathe right now and kept smoking didn't even really know what was going on and then I went to the hospital that night and they rushed me to another hospital to get my tonsils removed cuz they were like twice the size that they should be and then I had a throat infection and then it comes to find out I had was called like Barrett's esophagus which is like pre-cancer lining my esophagus from smoking and I don't know I guess just abuse over the years so that was that's what led to my tonsils being pulled out when you think about this

<timemark seconds="1082" />

shouldn't smoke too many of those because it's just plain tobacco I love I love him know I got to the point where I couldn't smoke joints I can smoke out of a bong or pipe it had to be a backwood that's why I am I like them did you ever smoke cigarettes know she I did I smoked a lot of cigarettes and then I quit smoking cigarettes just smoked weed and then I discovered Backwoods and I was kind of getting a little bit of both still getting the tobacco that I missed but yeah yeah my friend already said that he started smoking spliffs in England you know and when he was over another you can eat with the tobacco and you totally hooked on Tobacco again cuz he's quit cigarettes for years and then he started smoking the weed mixed with a tobacco and before he knew it he was smoking cigarettes again smoke molly was over there and then quit as soon as he was done and then came back to U of U S A I feel like they just start smoking just pure weed over there for years it was both

<timemark seconds="1142" />

I had that had that workout over there but still so illegal to are nuts just just to be able to in our road cases just so we could smoke over there cuz they had dirt weed Noah's horrible but yeah it was a pain in the ass fucking dangerous stuff overseas though yeah if you get arrested that's that's serious yeah I brought it so I bring it everywhere like that and we went to Iraq like gas tape man sitting in chair that the first layer of your nuts off when you go to grab your weed but yeah we would do that and then I actually brought it I made a big mistake of not bringing a bunch but I got to Iraq we went to Iraq for like right when the war broke out what was it like 2003 or 2004 and we were over there and and scandalous Estevan Oriol the photographer

<timemark seconds="1202" />

he's over there with us document the whole thing and I pull it out cuz we're at this this airport and ball rain but I feel like it's a field and no one's going to mess with us and he's like a bro look look at the back you fucking passport look what it says and it says right there like you're basically like they'll kill you if they if they find you know you brought any drugs and diarrhea course you know where we were about rain so I did away with everything and I just kind of took up drinking on that trip and I'm not really much of a drinker but you still smoke weed I have a friend who is like a dear friend is like a cool like young doctor named dr. be in San Diego and I called him he actually remove my my tonsils and then like a week later I found out I had what was called pre-cancer Barrett's esophagus I said what is this mean. To be shy just like kind of like kind of like tone down like how much I'm smoking you so I can know this means like this is your warning shot like

<timemark seconds="1258" />

attention stop smoking esophageal cancer has a rough one to have killed Christopher Hitchens you got it and you're gone basically said like 95% of the people to get it now so I felt like he he's always pretty honest with me and I stopped. I love CBD that's pretty much what I mess with now but that's all do you find a lot of people use CBD and they find that it alleviates anxiety and let some sleep better do you find that

<timemark seconds="1296" />

yeah as long as I take like triple or quadruple the amount that it says to take on the bottle cuz I feel like what I take if I take with the proper dosage has it doesn't do much but

<timemark seconds="1307" />

I'm one of those people whose Minds racing constantly I'll get them from the studio at one or two and I'm just like kind of like figuring out how long I got to sleep before I get to wake up my kids and go to school and I just sat there with my wheel spinning unless I use CBD and then it kind of helps and then I was called trigeminal neuralgia have you ever heard of that know it's called the suicide disease is basically all of your nerves in your face are firing all the same time cinemas feels like what you feel when you think you need a root canal or you have like a tooth that's messed up but I got trigeminal neuralgia and I've only had four episodes but when I do get it I use CBD in it it's been amazing but if you look it up a lot of people go actually go to a dentist get a bunch of root canals done that they don't need or they don't know how to treat it and usually people kill themselves yeah it's really know about I just was home one day I was like the fuck like

<timemark seconds="1367" />

motorcycle face is burning

<timemark seconds="1372" />

it's miserable condition affects the trigeminal nerve which carries the sensation for your face to your brain if you have trigeminal neuralgia even mild stimulation of your face itches from brushing teeth or putting on makeup a trigger a jolt of excruciating pain holyshit man yeah it works to cause what causes that all different things they thought like mine I maybe got mine from Impact like from my accident and then maybe a little sparring that I've done has as triggered it also Dental when I get dental work done it triggers it so but the CBD stops yeah CBD in it if it's really bad there's this medication called Gabapentin

<timemark seconds="1414" />

and I feel like that's been a real great way to kind of like mask the pain and once the Gabapentin calms the nerves kind of dads the nerve 24-48 hours it's gone it if it's a really bad episode of it's not so bad CBD just keeps it away a lot of nerve diseases are inflammation caused so sometimes like if you change your diet you can you can smooth some of those out like lower the sugar intake and some of the other things that might be causing inflammation did they give you any advice like that around the same time I figured out I was allergic to gluten which I really thought was horseshit whatever I was like yeah right okay yeah we need to be gluten free ride it and the doctor I had seen said what you really got to try that you got to come it 100% you got to give it at least like two to three weeks and see how you feel and I did it and it was a game-changer like I felt normal whereas I I'd have a lot of ups and downs depending on what I was eating and I'm still eating

<timemark seconds="1474" />

at the time I'm still eating vegan you know whatever but you know a lot of a lot of us can't you know digester or kind of our bodies can absorb the gluten-free ever had pasta in Europe yeah it's very different oh yeah so much shit in ours you know so much from Arizona I didn't know that he's got his own Winery runs in Austria but he said that when and we subsequently looked it up after he told me this in the early turn of the century when they were growing wheat they experimented and change the wheat to make it more dense so that you could get more yield out of an acre and so by doing that they changed what how your body processes that is more complex glutens in like a stalk of wheat like an old old time you eat like you would get like in Italy or

<timemark seconds="1534" />

France or something like that it's a different way it looks different it's a it's a much more scrawny looking plant and so if they had an acre that you don't get nearly as much wheat and sew in America we said hello and we made it bigger and better and sicker and your body is a much harder time processing it and that's why the people get so much inflammation and leaky gut and all these different nail mask that people get from bread and pasta in this country it's because of this much more complex weed but I buy pasta overseas I buy this God damn it in Italy that they sell it in America just for that reason yeah because I can eat it and if I want pasta It's not that disgusting I love pasta I do too but it's just it's something that I found if I eat a lot of it just sucks me so I have to make sure that I don't we find a real quick and I'll pull up there at the name of it and I felt like leaky gut was

<timemark seconds="1594" />

dog sounds like what are you talking about I never even heard about this but I feel like it's legit and and they're spot-on about that it's called Morelli Morelli spaghetti and it's from Italy in the type of wheat that they use it's a very different type of wheat I get to it tastes different it doesn't blow you up as much it's I think somebody explain it to me like what kind of wheat you're looking for but what I found is it I've tried gluten free pasta and it's like

<timemark seconds="1625" />

you know what I like better than gluten free pasta spaghetti squash spaghetti squash with marinara sauce is fucking delicious and I actually sometimes like it better than pasta but they said that everyone all the time in the hot Parts when spaghetti squash is outstanding guilt-free you know you can eat it and not thinking you're you know floating yourself up yeah but we've ruined pasta the ruined ruined pop but it said you know it gives you that feeling you know that feeling you get after you eat a lot of it immediately Tire you downloaded but if you eating in Italy you don't get that feeling and you look at those people over there and they're not fat it's true

<timemark seconds="1671" />

got to walk around all over the place and they're eating pasta of everyone's walking or riding bikes about France to France when they're eating those baguettes they're they're eating would like this very rich butter that's like a grass-fed butter to the dark yellow butter high fat content got a lot of essential fatty acids in it and you're just getting it and it's a different kind of bread to Amy Maldonado fat and they're drinking wine and they're not fat like it doesn't make any sense agreed standard American diet is just fucked up but I always wanted to ask you that about like the drumming cuz I mean everything that I do like everything repetitive words boxing or even archery you a lot of people get injuries in archery just from repetitive stress from just pulling the ball back over and over again like a goddamn Travis this your whole fucking thing is repetitive

<timemark seconds="1731" />

my elbows hurt not in my first week hurts my first week sucks I Contour really getting acclimated cuz even practice rehearsals are not a show just a different intensity but but yeah as long as I train for it I'm cool I kind of like

<timemark seconds="1747" />

boxing has helped so much and I don't box because I think I'm a tough guy I think I can you know beat people's asses whatever it's really just for functionality like so I can play the drums away I want to see started doing it for that reason I started when I knew my son was being born like when my girlfriend that I was pregnant I woke up that morning I ran to the freeway and back like twice and then I wouldn't found a boxing gym I walked into ten Goose actually walked into John braised who used to be Tyson sparring partner and it was like 2005 no 2003 and then I started boxing I just walked into ten goose and I I started jump roping and and heating pads and I don't know I just had this urge to want to like box and be better that's just from knowing that you were going to be a dad I just wanted to be better

<timemark seconds="1806" />

I thought to myself I wanted a lifestyle change I needed to evolve and I needed to know how to protect this little human I was bringing into the world and I knew I needed to change my lifestyle cuz I was asking out of control

<timemark seconds="1820" />

wow it's an amazing thing that happens to you when you become a father too weird switch that goes off in your brain that you can't really describe the people that don't have kids and it's even weirder when the switch doesn't go off till like you know you see people who are horrible fathers know my parents and I just don't get like how didn't how did that switch turn on for you you know the ones who don't want to be around the kids freak me out the most yeah but they just don't want to be there just want to be away all the time I just I don't get it I don't know why I couldn't imagine but yeah I know I love boxing like it's one of my favorite things to do I've been doing Muay Thai little bit more cuz I can kind of save my hands cuz it's not good on my hands in any way shape or form how so just the impact over and over that you are you getting directly

<timemark seconds="1879" />

I think there are 14 oz baby should switch like 18 or 20 sticker padding in the front it'll protect your knuckles better and it even gives you a better workout really cuz you're pushing more weight little heavier push more weight you'll have more more impact but another thing I would say is get a bag that's a water bag water bags are fantastic you ever seen those before I've seen him at the end of those things and it's it's minimal impact but you still pushing the same amount of weight you know through with throwing the punches you can still explode at the same amount of force but you know you're sinking into that bag and so a lot of people with tendonitis find that that's a way better option is another I have two bags out there and one of them's a fair text back and fair text makes the it's a Muay Thai bag but it's softer than the other ones a monster bad monster bags are Greeley hard that sits right one is good if I'm in

<timemark seconds="1939" />

reflect my shoulders bother me or something like that I can dig into that bag and it's not going to have the same jolt isn't getting something solid and hard so if you having problems with your hands that's what I would say nothing you can do is they make wraps or gel wraps you slide on your hand almost like a glove yeah that's what he just told me about me as if those are great and then that on top of the heavier glove I better. All the hand stop yeah I'm going to try that you just told me about that I protect my Knuckles little bit more cuz I find if I lift weights I never get big like I never look big but I feel kind of stiff and just slow it's the worst feeling ever and I did it one time right before I was living in Cheviot Hills for a little while and I was working out at the gym over there and was all bodybuilder guys and I will try and get one just to like be depressed and I got behind Mike it and it was the worst feeling ever be worse I felt like I was in slow motion so I figure it out like I need to train

<timemark seconds="1997" />

how I want to move when I'm actually playing the drums weightlifting spine but you have to do it lightly the saying about weight lifting is people want to do with the failure all the time you know to ten sets of this and five sets of that and go to failure every time, push push push push don't do that you shouldn't do that I subscribe to the Pavel tat Selene method he's a famous Russian kettlebell instructor and his philosophy is that you should do more sets but less repetition so I say if you could do a weight and you could lift it 10 times 10 times 55

<timemark seconds="2038" />

I was talk about esophageal cancer my voice is rebelling but if you say if you could lift something 10 times lift it five times and just do more sets and give yourself a lot of time in between sets because if your training for strength he can do certain things like kettlebells and specific where its strength but it's also endurance but really if you just want to do strength the best way to do it is to do off a short set of a few repetitions and then do multiple versions of that like take a long time off like 5-10 minutes and then do another five raps about 10 minutes to another 5 wraps and then do it again in a couple of days and then do it again instead of like once a week we just blow your body that feeling we moved and it's not a smart way because you don't recover as well to take a day off but I started doing was we just want trainer named on Wheatley figured out kind of like a metronome work out

<timemark seconds="2098" />

you actually like a temple work out where you're training to a Tempo so you have to do High Reps like you know you'll stay to a minute and maybe the tempo is like

<timemark seconds="2109" />

you know what I mean so whatever even if it's quick and you're not doing everything like exactly technique-wise really slow and you know it's it's kind of like making sure you stay up with the tempo which I feel like really help me with staying quick and fast with drums and more endurance you know yeah that makes sense is is a drumming a young man's game made is it like Athletics where as you get older drummer slow down

<timemark seconds="2134" />

I haven't I played just as wild as I did back in the day how old do you know 43 you look great thank you don't look for 3 at Max Weinberg told me one time he was he watching me play and he was like at a show or blank plate and he's like I don't know how much longer you can play like that he's like you're going to need back surgery you play lucky of rabies nothing has changed and I've just a play exactly how I always have you know I don't even want to think about a day where I have to play any different massages. That'll help a lot right massages Epsom salt bass that's where the tank comes in play man that thinks it's amazing the tank is all Epsom salt when you watch that I watch you play and I would just go how the fuck in the sky maintain this pace

<timemark seconds="2191" />

cuz everybody drums differently you know I mean it's really interesting to watch people's different it especially my friend Bill Burr really got into drumming and you know he's really into it and I like watching him play and it's it's interesting to see someone take something up and get better and take lessons and learn it but the thing that really strikes me is how many repetitions are involved like as you're doing this like the amount of times you're hitting his drums is fucking Insanity you got to pace yourself if it's a 2-hour set of this is not a big big part you know you can come chill but it's like around you know if you're going around look at the clock and you realize all washed up two minutes left pace yourself and you know what I mean that's kind of how I was but but the goal is to train so much before you even get on to her that you're not even having to think about that dude is playing the show exactly how you want to play it's almost imagine it's like that with fighting

<timemark seconds="2251" />

Envision what you want to do in your head you're in the shape and you know the technique to execute and you don't have to think about her going I can't do that I'm not enough I like to be able to just do whatever I'm feeling and not be no be like shitt I don't know how to do that or I'm going to get tired if I do that I don't want that to happen to know so that's the goal is just being able to execute what you have died in your head what musicians have to have discipline because you have to practice it said that's one of the things that makes you guys so unique in the entertainment world it's like I mean I guess maybe actress have to practice stand-up comedians we only practice in front of an audience but you guys have to fucking practice like she don't go through your show before you go out my right eye right and I listen to recordings of old sets but I don't like sit in front of me Argo hey folks yeah I don't do that I don't know anybody

<timemark seconds="2311" />

what to do it was filled with her Strife yeah that's the last thing you want you got to be in the moment something happens if you practice act like you're having fun so I try to practice a lot on my own and I'm not even practicing those songs just kind of just drill you know about the Beach Boys about their going out there likes to play I wish they could all be California Girls again like Jesus fucking truck becomes a job that you don't want that you wanted to be fresh and exciting and you wanted to be something that you really in the moment really thinking about so I make up new shitt on the spot to that's the best is I just make up new fails or just try to reinvent the songs to the point where even like Markle look back at me and that's the best you know just kind of freaking it on the fry and even to the crowd like that before

<timemark seconds="2371" />

that's like after two or three months of being on Torrey to stuff like that when you get off tour do you consciously give yourself a rest

<timemark seconds="2382" />

no I'm busier at home that I am not Tour on torso the average man like you have to have someone saying you do have people kind of waiting on you hand and foot someone you know I ate catering you know ready if you want to eat or have you got to go do an interview 30 minutes before you go onstage cars outside waiting for you after the show taking you to the hotel so that doesn't happen at home you know and it home I do so many other things besides playing the band that guy you know pretty is a bunch of a part is I have Crossroads at clothing companies have three kids it's way busier at home torres-torres a vacation for me cuz I don't know how to say no either have a lot of things I love that I love doing so I can't complain if you like oh I hate going to the store I hate doing this I love it all I just kind of love it all so much that I have trouble saying no sometimes

<timemark seconds="2439" />

so when you hear you said you're managing or you're producing rap artist how many suicide boys who are awesome there from New Orleans and we have a EP coming out this called live fast die whenever and we just finished over the weekend so or yesterday so it's you know you go in there at noon and you leave there at 4 in the morning everyday until you're finished cuz they're only in town for a little while so yeah it takes a little bit and stations album before he passed away I work with like smokepurpp Vic Mensa a bunch of different artists a different genre helps you mix it up a little bit then just a big rap fans and Ice Cube shirt

<timemark seconds="2499" />

Public Enemy in the far side and krs-1 that's what I grew up on and then I discovered I loved metal to out of Slayer and King Diamond and then I discovered a band called Minor Threat The Descendants and black flag and Bad Brains and I just liked it all and then my dad listen to jazz music and Country rebel music so I was born in raised on like Johnny Cash and Buck Owens and everything so I kind of learned to love it all and I had people around me when I was young when I was first learning how to read music that just kept invading my head like you got to listen to everything catches me one thing so I was actually taught how to play with your digital Jazz when I was really young and then I taught myself how to play everything else that's fucking cool yeah but I always loved everything I see David appreciation for all those different genres to all you did was

<timemark seconds="2553" />

UFC commentating you'd be like I'ma go crazy like this must be so much fun for you and all of your other endeavors like same thing like if I was only making you know punk rock records or pop punk records or whatever it was I think I would go insane and it's been like that for four years you know I think different people I think some people unhappy shit they love it I just want to do that but there's some people like you or maybe like me that I need different things and summer thing the other week and then the next day I'm in with like a band called Nothing nowhere doing something completely different this week I'm doing a little peep and XXX remix it's it has to be like that for me or I get really bored and I just don't feel creative real kind of like I don't know that's how I like that phone call or someone texts you hey Travis we need you to come in here and

<timemark seconds="2613" />

like this motherfucker on fire and you get in there and yeah it's been like that you know or likes you know some projects manifested to like there has been called the fever 333 that I produce and write with and they just got nominated for a Grammy like you're up for a Grammy for Best Rock performance and that was something I just envisioned with the singer that band Jason and we started literally a year ago and they are nominated for Grammy why so like stuff like that like kind of being an architecture without building buildings being architectural music or whatever it is whatever it is you're passionate about that excites me this billing sound yeah like there's nothing better mix it up and like how do you use like to schedule your time in terms of like how much time you going to spend on your own Studio work how much time you going to spend on other people's stuff to just play it by ear

<timemark seconds="2673" />

it seems like with a guy like you must get so many requests and you said you have a hard time saying no I would imagine it's fucking overwhelming will my kids come first before everything you know and then I get a lot of opportunities like my son Landon is a big rat fan like he loves right he was raised on rap music like he grew up to on with me and Lil Wayne when I told Lil Wayne and he loves being in the studio so he'll come with me dance studio so I can kind of like double dip work at the same time as he's in be making music on my studio which is really really awesome and then send me the Alabama she's a I'm lucky they're both musicians cuz Alabama and let him both love music so they like going on tour with me that I've done some names like me yeah I probably wouldn't be working so much that's really cool what the fuck is it like going on tour with Lil Wayne

<timemark seconds="2726" />

it was so awesome I came out with a wrap a wrap projekt red produced I've made all the beats and I just got all my favorite rappers everyone from Mike Rizzo from the Wu-Tang Clan to Lil Wayne game Swizz Beatz it was it was cracking I had 30 guests on there and Wayne asked me to go out on me and Mix Master Mike from the BCS we're like the opening act on that tour Drake was out there Nicki Minaj and Rick Ross so I loaded up the bus with everyone I brought Yelawolf out I brought J-Rock about Paul Wall I brought the cool kids and we just got in a bus moving out or Jesus Christ how long are those shows all those people that's a long life is so fun, but

<timemark seconds="2786" />

which meant just being able to play in that genre music cuz I listen to it as a kid there's never really been a home for live drummer in a rap scenario so from the beginning I think I don't even know what year was when puff call me when I just joined blinking is like you I want you to be in this video I was like what was just like I'm in one of the biggest bands in the world I'm so stoked I couldn't ask for any more and I always want to go I'll just wanted to get that tour was so fun yeah once puff asked me to be in a video is kind of like a I just snowballed from there you just got in that world yeah I had no idea why this is so cool because I grew up on biggie like I loved all that genre of music but I was okay with just staying in my Lane as well but when I got accepted with like open arms and I was invited to do like bet

<timemark seconds="2846" />

42 TI or tiger when it was just the funny thing is I've never played but I played the Grammys with like a pitbull Drake Eminem like it's so it's so weird to me I just feel it it's a trip the opportunities I've had outside of rock music have been such blessings to you when you say all those things and you know that you did a dream like smacking myself like it doesn't feel real

<timemark seconds="2878" />

I feel like I'm so spoiled and I've been so blessed to play with all these musicians I love that I Just a Nobody you know whatever comes I'm happy with that cool though that's great man it's means you're fulfilled yeah you're you're you're doing what you want to do like your ready tell whoever let's do it if you wanted to record jar be there you know the answer I'm saying lucky for you I'm totally going to happen but that doesn't get any better I love Dom he's awesome me a couple times I used to walk out and famous stuff like when UFC wasn't they didn't have rebug year and you would come down and trained cuz I would train with this one guy Josh over here in Woodland Hills and he said travel Menifee

<timemark seconds="2938" />

little did I know if you Dom tossing me around like sucking my gosh man it was so difficult

<timemark seconds="2949" />

when I be he do I try to sleep me I try to knock me out today so I'm giving my all and any houses uses defense actually swing in the air during somebody so I'm swinging in the air he's like on the side of me all of a sudden so talented so yes, I love that God stress to him to everything he does he does he's probably one of the most unique MMA fighters ever I feel like a lot of people have kind of borrowed from his style to stop your kind of Moves Like unquestionably and that's because of his intelligence

<timemark seconds="3009" />

is very unorthodox way of moving he's a real Encyclopedia of information we start talking about fighting like he's a really enjoy doing commentary with him because he's so insightful he's so good at pointing out little areas where he thinks people making mistakes or how to capitalize on certain things that people doing yeah I've watched them before and he's he gives a different Insight than what I'm seeing now is great especially when it comes to wrestling clinch work and you know any and even like weird striking techniques and he just he's so good at be funneling people that he fights with with movement and information like he's giving them looks and they're they're trying to set up and understand they're trying to set up and they don't know what the fuck is doing and they have to reset and they trying to get a different-looking stand over here and then again man

<timemark seconds="3069" />

how much I feel like you just you know he when he got back from knee surgery and he went so hard to give himself plantar fasciitis so fucked up the bottom of his feet from running and sprinting and doing all kinds of crazy should get in shape and you know he got over there and he's had so many different surgeries nice never had planner man I had it on at or where I would get these I get these weird kind of things where I have to do a certain thing before I go onstage so one of the things I did on a tour that was I don't know about a four month old is run 45 miles before the show and bite it by the middle of that tour at actually giving myself a stress fracture in my foot was terrible did you run on concrete not a treadmill yeah wow damn well sometimes sometimes when when there was no treadmill I just run out in the street but I kind of get like that where I just like I don't know I get obsessive about stuff

<timemark seconds="3129" />

I want it I want to do it I I get to throw myself all the way in now Nike running shoes do you run with the run with I was running like honestly I'm not running Vans which is probably my problem but you know. So quick like I have an hour here to do this but yeah that it wasn't fun though it was painful yeah when you have overuse injuries are some of the hardest especially your feet it's one of ours to recover from because you have to walk it's not like if you hurt your elbow you get is not use it for a while and it'll eventually heal up but you need to use a rough one man I know a lot of people have got that I've been very lucky I came from martial arts background lot of Kicking and stuff like that so I'm I feed a pretty strong from moving but I found it running with Minimalist Shoes on heels. That made him even stronger Yoga Yoga Maui stronger another company called vivobarefoot a word

<timemark seconds="3189" />

I like those a little bit better for running on the Hills because I'm running out a lot of rocks and shed in the Vibrams they do be great if everything was soft dirt but I'm running on weird Jagged rocks and shit and it hurts your feet you got to be real careful where you place your feet but it just forces your feet to work as they're supposed to as opposed to like a big cushiony running shoe you know like a cushioned running shoe feels good it feels good to run on a cuz you get all those cushions. So jarring but your body really really should run I think personally unless you're a runner you should probably run less with a minimal issue then you should run like because it's more comfortable to run with the big fat cushion I think you ultimately give yourself probably more injuries that way but you can get injuries from those Minimalist Shoes too if you don't pay close attention you try too hard too quick on your foots not condition for it my feet are terrible two man I had what it was called a lisfranc fracture

<timemark seconds="3249" />

it's basically your foot breaks in half while your 10 in your ligaments and your bones how the fuck did you do that so I was high as a kite and I was in Australia and I was running to the bus and I had like two huge bags that would like to I like I buy a 40 lb on my back and I was just trying to get to the bus to get to the next show or whatever and it was the the stupidest thing ever but it was a little like you know the little cracks in the sidewalk went up higher and I didn't see and I fell with all that weight on me and I'm in the bus and I'm starting to think while this is really bad and my twin mattress like a man just get the blood flowing try walking on it and I'm trying to just suck it up and I'm walking in the airport I'm like almost like tearing like I'm fucking hurting so bad I was like man I think I need to get an x-ray or like an MRI this isn't good so I played like the next two shows with my other foot I get an x-ray they say I have broken my foot in half I need surgery so I

<timemark seconds="3309" />

I think I end up doing a couple weeks of the tour which I shouldn't have I should have gone and done the surgery but I played it with my other foot and then I got home I did the surgery and I was like six months on crutches just recovering it was terrible 6 months cuz I was taking so many painkillers and everything it was slowing down the process which I don't know if you've heard of but that it really like my bones became super brittle from pain from painkillers Norcos

<timemark seconds="3344" />

yeah I would imagine the pain must have been fucking excruciating snapping your foot in half was so painful just smoke weed enough

<timemark seconds="3362" />

does really bug me what about edibles

<timemark seconds="3366" />

haven't really done it you don't fuck with Edibles really nothing zero no alcohol no nothing which was a big way after my accident as well I was fed you know for months and a hospital being fed morphine every day for 4 months and then being on all these bipolar meds and everything else I honestly didn't want to put anything on my body when I got out I didn't even take painkillers when I got home

<timemark seconds="3396" />

know what kind of bipolar meds they put you on I was on like 4-5 just bipolar and then I mean I had like I had so many I pray like 12 medications I got sent home with and I did it for about a week or two and then I went to see my doctor I'd actually overheard one of my friends talking

<timemark seconds="3415" />

who is like a brother to me and I heard him talking to someone else he was like you know like

<timemark seconds="3421" />

Travis seems a little different you know she seems a little bit slow or something and it and I overheard him he didn't know I overheard him but I was these meds I had been telling my dog smells like I just don't feel like me and so I don't know I feel weird and I just don't feel like myself so I just flush them down the toilet one day and next week I came back to see him he's like how you doing I said good I'm off all those meds you told me I'd be on for the rest of my life no like a dude from what you've been through like it's okay to be on something like that and I was like yeah I'm doing fine though like I don't need those you know because of the plane crash yeah they like don't shame yourself and you know it by giving yourself a hard time that you have to take these pills and I said well let you know I'll just I don't feel like they're doing what they're supposed to for me and actually having like a negative effect on me so I don't I really don't want to take them you know they also told me that never run again I'd never do this and never do that again so I think I just got to the point where I was like

<timemark seconds="3479" />

let me see how many things I can prove otherwise that they've told me you know once I stop taking the pills Jesus so they put you on bipolar medication because of a traumatic crash yeah that seems odd to me I mean I'm not a doctor obviously but well I was kind of crazy you know I was like suicidal

<timemark seconds="3499" />

when I was in the hospital I was on so many drugs I couldn't even I didn't even know my friends have passed away I didn't even know the two pilots I passed away I didn't remember anything I kept thinking like everyone was in the hospital including the two pilots including my two best friends and am I thought everyone was just in different rooms till about two weeks before I left and then I went crazy then it was like they had a you know 5150 case on your hands you know I wasn't I wasn't in a good place so yeah then I did I did a lot of like post-traumatic like therapy when I was in the hospital too kind of like calm things down once I got through all my surgeries and then yeah I mean over time it was it was cool but it was never cool but I started to feel better you know but yeah I think it was cuz I was so crazy at the time but it's interesting that I would think that bipolar medication would be

<timemark seconds="3559" />

something that you would give someone who has like a condition that just as sort of preet there predisposed to it I don't know anything about bipolar but I would think that that's something that you just have you know it's like you have a mental condition I wouldn't think that would be something that they would give you to overcome a traumatic incident yeah I think they were afraid I was going to be Advocate mental condition after everything happened you know I think like maybe because you're an artist that you probably a little crazy anyway and possibly I mean like I think but I was a mess to like you know like I had died I smoke so much weed everyday and I taken so many pills and and I would self-medicate quite a bit that I woke up probably out of 11 at my 30 surgeries I had in the burn center I woke up swinging on doctors

<timemark seconds="3609" />

so because I would wake up and I would just I'd be opened up and I would just go crazy Jesus Christ so they can get off the table to get off the table I don't even think I really knew what was going on I just wasn't they couldn't give me enough medication to knock me out cuz I've been self-medicating for so long and abusing meds for so long so you would get up from anesthesia wake up in the middle of anesthesia so yeah that that was crying I was a problem how did you clean up

<timemark seconds="3644" />

I think after I think the last time I saw him going to doctor they were kind of like you're not going to eat you can't be here no more and then I was like wow well I need more surgeries and I I really was just fighting demons you know I just figured out like my two best friends had passed away and the pilots have passed away and I was just like in an ugly place you know my kids couldn't come visit me because 65% of my body was burned so I couldn't be around people so I was just a minute man and then and then I just I don't know I turn the corner and then I was like a team player and I don't think I was on as many meds most of my surgeries were over and just learning how to walk again being able to take a shower by myself again all that stuff man I think that was just those are the good points that help me turn the corner and I don't know I just had more strength you know so wow so you just just turned a corner and

<timemark seconds="3704" />

mind just sort of accepted it and yeah same drugs like I didn't ever do rehab anything I think it was mainly my kids and just a second life second chance at life was enough for me I was like I don't I never want to do any of that stuff again you know that's cool so once you get a certain amount of distance between you and those days does it seem like like it wasn't even real it wasn't you doing those things yeah you look back in your just like I still talk to those doctors to this day like Dr Grossman he's he's he's so awesome and basically saved my life you know but I still talk to him he lives out here in the valley and yes Grossman Burn Center and I go with that Christmas and and see burn you know burn victims that are over there in that in the burn center and help out any way I can but yeah that's pretty cool

<timemark seconds="3755" />

yeah many of my friends so I know that I had real bad drug problems and then now or off drugs they'd look back and then go what I know what the fuk was I doing like how did I get how is that mean yeah it's interesting how that happens in your life or you have these new chapters in your life and in and sometimes it could just be something that happened like 2 weeks ago and you're like who the fuck was that guys who weeks to go I'm not even here anymore you could sometimes people make these abrupt turns and their life and then they go yeah I'm never going back and you go by will see and then you look Ten Years Later like while you were right you never went back and I think like I still have if you ever heard it was called like user dreams are like I think I fucked up and I'm smoking weed again I wake up and going to stop cuz I must I love smoking so much you know where would it whatever your Vice was you know if it was like whatever was yeah you're just like you wake up and you think you're doing it again and then you realize Nam

<timemark seconds="3815" />

ice have dreams like that where I had to go back to HighSchool really I just have dreams for years Man legend high school to be a professor fucking doctor something but I just had no idea what I want to do for a living and I was just like being trapped in a classroom constantly was excruciating yeah I must have had a daimyo probably do have like some crazy form of Adda I don't know I never been diagnosed never been to a shrink but if I did I'm sure they probably try to put me on something if I tried to tell him what's going on and what time did Jesus sit down I want to take these whatever you're doing is bad but when I was in high school I fucking hate it and I barely got by and then when I got out of high school I would have these dreams where I would wake up in the middle of the night and I didn't have enough credits to graduate and have to go back I was sitting there in my bed before I woke up trying to decide whether or not I was just going to fuck

<timemark seconds="3875" />

drop out and not graduate from high school not have a high school diploma or go back and do another fucking year of hell and it would make my guts would turn and wake up and come and I graduated I graduated

<timemark seconds="3890" />

yeah it was the worst idea I was the same way a man I just like just barely got by high school did you go to school here in Riverside. The double dose Muay Thai out there people like to fight in Fontana and Fontana just skated by high school and then I didn't even want to walk a fucking hate it so much I actually rode my skateboard with my friends that were like much older than me. To go skateboarding with every day and we were skateboarding by the high school as everyone walked and got her diploma and I was just I didn't want to fucking be there then go to my graduation like I'm gone yeah like this is once I got through them like you don't have me anymore I can be free

<timemark seconds="3949" />

took me awhile to figure out what the fuck to do next yeah I would sit there and they will be like so what do you want to do to play drums in a band really like you going to talk to me like I was like just insane it's not crazy that there's so many bands and there's so many drummers why is that not an option said well you know like I don't know if they motivated you to actually do what you're passionate about you know instead of just being well that's not going to happen so what do you want to do

<timemark seconds="3982" />

how many fucking people that probably want to be drummers and just never got a push and never never you know I never made it through the other argument that if you really want it you'll find it yeah you got to do it I mean my dad used to tell me the same thing he'd be like

<timemark seconds="3999" />

you got to have a plan B and I'd be like well if I have a plan B I'm not going to try that hard to start thinking in my head and then that's when I just said Norfolk that like it's only this no matter if I'm rich or poor what at whatever whatever the circumstances this is what I'm doing I don't give a fuk with The Alchemist I think that's the right mindset I don't think people get by that well when I was just started to stand up there was a lot of guys who'd full-time jobs and they got degrees and you know they would work their full-time job and then they would just do stand up a couple nights a week they never made it is the obsessed guys and women the people that were just like I this is my fucking life this is what I do I'm going to do this those are the ones that do with the no safety net people the ones that made it yeah I mean it's gonna fucking happen you just have to you have to stick with it you know that I feel like the people who really stick with it and give it like a hunter

<timemark seconds="4059" />

10% of your time will come it's it will have a big or small it is something will happen you know if you figure it out and keep improving keep learning and learn from your mistakes and learn from your setback keep trying to push and get better and improve if you do all those things is as hopeless and helpless as it seems if you continue to improve you've got to get you a better place you got to get better in one day you'll be undeniable and if you don't and if you just fall back on that safety-net you're always going to wonder you know you was going to look at Travis Park guell Buckingham of the drums and going to shut that could have been me my pops and my pops is awesome but he's like Vietnam vet and Harley his whole life and you just said to me was like yo you got to you got to start paying rent the house cuz you know you're not high school no more

<timemark seconds="4113" />

or get like a 60 hour week job like a real job or you need to go and I'll go fucking play drums for you're not going to do it here in my garage I was like okay and it was the best thing that was ever said to me you know as harsh as it was or whatever and then I had actually caved in and I just told my my friend Noah was like you know what I think I'm just going to I'm going to get this fucking job cuz I just somehow got a job let you know in a warehouse was like Target warehouse making pretty good money compared to what I was making at the time and any hit me the next day and he's like I think you're making a big mistake I think you're very fucking talented and I think you'll regret this and you can get this bullshit job any anytime down the line come live with me on you know stay at my house you can sleep on the floor of the couch and let's play in this fucking band and do it and I did it you know I was like a trash man in Laguna Beach lived in like this studio apartment with a couple other guys and I just fucking took off like I had to like I mean it was like humility to you

<timemark seconds="4173" />

it was like playing bar after bar and you know you know but I was eating I was eating I was going to like I was skateboarding everyday and I was living at the beach playing in about my friend so for me at all right already made it those are the best story of the best stories and I think back even to this day I go to Laguna sometimes I'm like wow that was kind of one of the best moments of my life besides my children being born like poor no money but like happy as fuck cuz I can't even think of another time I was at happy you know school is a pressure trying to succeed is that the pressure of already succeeding in the overwhelming pressure that you must experience now the stories of like you didn't know if it was going to yeah yoga stories right now some kids are listening those stories right now listening you say this and I fuck man I'm going to do it

<timemark seconds="4233" />

can right now just saying this because a lot of them are teeter totter and I'm not going to do it in my not going to do it even I mean I was at the time you just have to

<timemark seconds="4242" />

you know don't worry about being cool or being fucking Rich you're having money just be passionate about what you're passionate about and fucking dedicate a hundred percent you know anything where it's not sure yeah it's not a it's not it's not a definite thing you were in this weird limbo space like man I got to be a loser my whole life like what what's going to happen to me and those moments man when you look back and you realize you could have quit but you kept going you figured it out you sucked it up you work your way through it you improved you can't move that's that's life that's what defines you ma'am I really does I just love those fucking stories I can never get enough of them and the other the dirty grimy and then finally make it story

<timemark seconds="4295" />

yeah once I had like a new wife and I divorced my ex-wife and she wasn't really stoked on the ex-wife's name on me and she always had to see it and then that's the only time I've ever done it there's nothing on me I really want to get rid of round like all that it's all a story to me and I'll tell the story it's like a moment in time and I got it for a reason but I was trying to be cool and you know what I mean trying to be respectful and made her happy at the time I sent yeah I mean it was amazing she hung in there all the way to being married with another chicks name on your neck yeah it's good woman true

<timemark seconds="4355" />

but in that regard

<timemark seconds="4358" />

but yeah I love tattoos men are addicting them to once I figured out they didn't hurt at the age of fifteen it was on I didn't like what people tell you it's so painful and then you get when you like wait a minute. So bad this is like it's kind of like a slight burn the same same when I did my back piece I fell asleep and I had two artists working on me at the same time I wow just cuz I fucking hate wasting time so that yeah they did my back together they did my head together to it has impressive let me see that I'm so with that looks like

<timemark seconds="4400" />

when did you get that done I did my head like I don't know 6 years ago wow that Mister Cartoon did Back in the Day. Cartoon is such as amazing yeah he he did that and then that kind of Set It Off I always had like praying hands on the side of my head and then I shaved my head and I've never grow my hair out since cuz I'm like fuck it it's permanent haircut you know what is up there it's hard to see why you think I'd like a transplant gas masks on the back of my head I have one life one chance yeah and then like some writing

<timemark seconds="4460" />

wow now when you got burned did it affect your tattoos did you have to tattoo over it yeah so I lost I lost all of my tattoos on my legs wow yes I lost I lost my first tattoo ever which was a dag nasty tattoos hardcore band punk band that I love forever and a bones tattoo shows my nickname growing up but I lost everything on my legs so then they do like they do is call that grafting so they won't allow some tattoos for my Baxley take like a cheese grater and they grade all of your skin off your back and my thighs and then they staple it to you with pig cadaver and they will wait for a for you to start healing so yeah so I lost a lot of tattoos and then I I did I like on my sides can only see I did I did memorials for 4 though Christian A & D J M who who all passed away in the accident so I put them on my legs

<timemark seconds="4521" />

over the grass so you can really see it but yeah I mean I got out pretty well man like you can kind of see it on my hand my hand you can see it's discolored and stuff but for having almost 70% of my body burn like you can really tell that's amazing cuz you're so tattooed up the pain of healing Burns supposed to be excruciating it's dfucking worst thing ever for me to I mean I don't think you guys ever think about being burnt I know I didn't I'll just be like I don't know I just never think about fire

<timemark seconds="4555" />

until you're on fire and then you're like oh shit and then and then that you know the treatments afterwards to like do everything you know like they would put me in this big pan that was literally about as big as this table with different people all around you and they would scrape all my burns with a metal brush to get rid of all the infection cuz I had I basically when I when I jump through the emergency exit when I open emergency exit before the plane blew up I was in such a hurry to get out of the the plane and exit the plane I jumped right into the jet which is full of fuel

<timemark seconds="4594" />

so my whole body lit up you know so I had jet fuel just in my whole body like I burped jet fuel from most like 3 months so they had like that was the main thing to get rid of infection is a scrub you with a metal brush to get rid of all of it and all the dead skin and then and I did about 30 surgeries to to repair everything I skin graph surgeries they say my foot is a one-point they're going to amputate my right foot yeah it was wild they were going to have to admit it was it was necrosis or like what was going on that they were going to amputate it I think cuz that was the thing that was most soaked was was my shoes and socks I jumped into the Jets you know and I had done like I exited the plane I started running I'd started like ripping off my clothes just that's what my instinct always just get rid of everything but little

<timemark seconds="4654" />

I would still be on fire cuz the jet fuel was and I was soaked in it so I'm actually running towards the highway I was right on the side of me and I just hear some Guy Yell like stop drop and roll and it just like I heard it out of all this chaos of every sirens and everything and I stop drop and roll and the only thing I was still on fire was my feet and am came in so I think they were on fire the longest to so still like my my right foot is probably like over 50% of its a graft yeah that's wild but yeah that was like I never like I said I never even thought about it's not something you think about until it happens to you but being burnt is like a it's it's horrific you know would you affected by the recent fires on here

<timemark seconds="4703" />

it came about couple hundred yards from one of my houses a while but I was in Vegas I was actually playing the show we left that morning and then we got phone call saying you had to evacuate the way to go to talk to you thank God yeah the kids my dogs with me my my housekeeper was at the house so she was able to get the rest of our dogs out and yeah we were as long as I had them there with me and I was like everything else is replaceable it's whatever but yeah that was sketchy I mean you saw obviously you live before they had a mandatory at 2 in the morning I came back to The Comedy Store my wife and I were looking out the window and the Flames are coming over the hill and I said no one's going to save us here I go you know we have to figure out what the fuck were going to do and she's like I think we should go and I sat all right I think you're right and we just got a hotel room and we just bailed and I just grabbed I literally grab my laptop and I think that's it

<timemark seconds="4763" />

some some clothes and then the kids are a little freaked out by sitting here till I was like let it burn you know I mean I don't want it to burn obviously but rather than you being hurt like fuck man this is this is it's an inconvenience when when you're when you lose your house it's a horrific tragedy when you lose your life and I we're not we're going to get the fuck out of here and so they were freaked out but within a day or two and we say no hotel for a week but will it be in a day or two more laughing about it the same we did the same thing that came up came home but not really home you know she said that a hotel for a week but I felt kind of helpless I couldn't do much you know it's not like I could sit there and and put out the fire myself you know they wouldn't even let us in our community same here people that weren't around here that they don't know how crazy it was but the sky was filled

<timemark seconds="4823" />

smoke everywhere you look with smoke I mean all of La was filled with smoke it was I've never I we wish we stayed in Beverly Hills at the Waldorf and you look out the balcony window and it's just fucking gray just smoke everywhere I've never seen far as like that before never in my life either and I always see were on high alert did not see it like my kids are at school over in Malibu a really close to there and I always see how are there but nothing's ever really happened has been like small fires but that was horrific that was just it look like Hiroshima is in our neighborhood like you know airplanes flying really low dropping like fire retardant it was it was crazy flies helicopters he's got his helicopter license and we took a flight around Malibu Around The Point Dume and you go over there and see these massive Estates just burnt to the ground he's gorgeous houses with the perfect view on the bluff overlooking the ocean gone huge Lots you know

<timemark seconds="4883" />

$1000000 house is gone just burnt to the ground and there's so many of them and then like one house standing there one house out of just random cough I was weird or some shit will fly to the air land on someone's house and if you have like pine needles or something on your roof or a flammable roof catches on fire was it a campfire to start at like my heart is called campfire think it was a campfire that was the name of the fire I don't think I don't I don't know what the fuck the cause of that fire was Jamie see if you can find them out do you know what it is trying to blame different utility companies what not and they're not they're not taking the blame or they can prove that it wasn't them and they might not yet

<timemark seconds="4935" />

fucking crazy though man when I was in Boulder there was a giant fire that broke out that was a fireman accidentally started of how to fire pit in his backyard and members blew out of his fire pit and start a giant fire and just burnt the massive amounts of wild forest is just gone farm-in imagine a lot of people. He must have felt like shit it mean anybody so I mean just couldn't fucking imagine if it was your fault that one of these things get started I would I wouldn't be sleeping for weeks Northern California Northern California Northern California City California they lost like a shitload of people died on the highway is a burnt to death in their cars you see those photos yes fuck man

<timemark seconds="4994" />

yeah you know inside a lot of this is because of you mean there's a lot of issues right there's the the dry you know the fact the dry climate the fact that we know there's a climate change is happening but also the fact that there's no small fires like all those those dead trees are supposed to get knocked down by small fire so I can controlled fires and those done that doesn't really happen anymore we don't want small fires that can possibly get out of hand and so you you have these forests that are often times filled with dead trees right next to live trees in a lot of dead trees all over the place while so they're supposed to do it that's like maintenance burning like the small ones some people Advocate doing it for maintenance but in nature that's like a natural thing like the lightning would hit light something on fire in though the live trees would probably survive in a lot of the Dead ones would burn to the ground and would actually regenerate the forest and I mean the crazy thing is like you look how fucking Lush

<timemark seconds="5053" />

green it looks out here now or you would never imagine that just a few months ago this was a raging Inferno

<timemark seconds="5061" />

it actually is good for the ground you know all that stuff smells like right now right this yeah everytime it rains it because of your accident took a little while for us to have pyro again never it was like we just got back together

<timemark seconds="5082" />

and like this really really like killer like photographer had this idea to do this photoshoot and they wanted us holding like the Watchmen called the thing like the flares accident

<timemark seconds="5095" />

he got me to hold it for a second I was like bro I can't do this like wrong photoshoot like I'm sorry you know I know you have this Vision but that's an insensitive Vision yeah yeah yeah right that would have been a little bit more fitting but and then and now we do pyro stuff on on stage and production it doesn't really bug me but I'm very cautious around the house like with me and my daughter she has I got a straight iron plugged in or for my son whatever lights a candle like I'm so crazy about it

<timemark seconds="5129" />

I am a little weird so I have to ask you this Tom talk about UFOs all the time but you know he's not in the van but it didn't just look out the bus window for a while and I used to do it with him as like it's kind of a bonding experience it's like you wanted to show me bow and arrows whatever check it out so with Tom that was his thing like fucking Let's get high and look for UFOs so we would there we just sit there and stare out the bus window look at you at the house or like give you can go as far as when we're on tour like let's go and fucking look for bigfoot assemble a crew and they would go do it for me but but I would not do that and he was always it's really not something he just got into from the day I fucking met him

<timemark seconds="5189" />

very passionate about it to the point where I didn't know enough to have any kind of I guess like opinion on it that was just very open and you know just took it all in but nothing has changed he's still there the day I talk to me like I'm on the way to the fucking white house bro as you should be like that's fucking go yeah great response good luck with that wow that's crazy yeah he was a trip man having a conversation with him was very strange cuz I'm a part of me was like Skype putting me on and he would like amazing right like you think that's an actual UFO like that is the fakest fucking video I've ever seen in my life but he didn't see that at all in his mind he was sick

<timemark seconds="5249" />

a real alien spaceship whatever George Bush just didn't you just coming at me with some like politics he's been watching CNN or or like he's just he's always been obsessed with it so he's obsessed with all sorts of like hidden things like not just UFOs but Bigfoot to and conspiracy theories politics yet everything very very passionate about all those things conspiracy theories and politics it's an interesting weather because people were always wondering like who the fuck is running things what what's really going on what's Happening behind the scenes who's pulling the strings what is it all really mean yeah you know

<timemark seconds="5300" />

what the UFO thing is like pool boy boy you got up I mean I absolutely believe there could be intelligent life out there but I haven't seen a fucking single thing that makes me think that anybody's got a picture video I'm not dedicating my life to search for it you know and I I give it to a man to like honestly to walk away from your fucking very successful band to go do that shit like I have nothing but respect for his passion but it's like I couldn't do that that's insane yeah it's like that just it really shows like he's you know he's very very passionate about it I hope you saved up some money you know Survivorman Les Stroud Survivorman would go out into the woods with a limited

<timemark seconds="5360" />

things he would say like okay I've got this bucket of got a fucking pocket knife and I got a ball a ball of yarn and I'm going to survive out here for 7 days and he films the whole thing and he be filming himself like eating frogs and catching a squirrel and finding edible plants and let just living out in the forest and often times 1 days and days without food and then he would have liked a point where he get rescued 7 Days in there would be a spot where they would meet him he had an experience when he was in Alaska a long time ago where he was camping and he said he heard footsteps like big heavy footsteps and you heard some sounds that sound like a gorilla. Like something like that and then it ran off into this day he's convinced that that was a Bigfoot and so now he has Survivorman Bigfoot and he goes out into the woods and just looks for evidence of Sasquatch

<timemark seconds="5420" />

he should be nice that you needs day at a time, pull up and he would love that I went hunting for bigfoot for a television show did for Syfy called Joe Rogan questions everything we went in looking for bigfoot in the more I talk to his Bigfoot folks the more I was convinced that none of these motherfuckers that ever was one lady that I talked to one lady who just did not seem like a liar and she was telling me that she saw something in the woods and it was standing up and it was tall at 7 a m p tall and she's like why is there a gorilla in the woods and then she's like oh my God that's pigfoot and it said it was a Pacific Northwest outside of Washington state in Washington state outside of Seattle and the woods are so dense up there that if anything goes 10 20 ft it's gone the problem with that is it is black bears up there and blackbear sometimes stand up on two feet they do

<timemark seconds="5480" />

call time and if you saw black foot especially black bear rather especially from a distance you would think it was a big gorilla which they do do when they're trying to see something they'll stand up and they'll even walk is a lot of videos of them walking on two feet and just on the right. That's crazy I just I don't she might Overlook they might be real there might be a few of them left there definitely was a thing called gigantopithecus that lived in Asia and the thought is that it came across the Bering land bridge the same time that Native Americans came across from Asia and that they came across and you know cuz they lived in Asia and this this gigantopithecus I think lived as recently as a hundred thousand years ago I think that the most recent fossils they have of it which is you know human beings been alive back then and this thing was six or eight to 10 ft

<timemark seconds="5540" />

tall bipedal hominid so was it a huge huge ape like creature

<timemark seconds="5549" />

the crazy shit ever bears walking on two legs see if you believe the hype and your search for bigfoot out there are you doing he's got to hurt right foot that's what that is is his right foot something wrong with his right foot sometimes yeah it looks like he's missing his front paws sometimes you know Bears a fight with each other and one barrel by the other pairs put off or you could have gotten shot or it could have broke it off on something yeah

<timemark seconds="5593" />

that's crazy I was missing a foot so he's he's walking around out there like a gorilla

<timemark seconds="5598" />

but everybody else I was like it when I'm talking to them that they're like living in make-believe world has another one walking around that is weird man those are big a big ass bear stealing on two feet people man

<timemark seconds="5615" />

I think that is a a big reason why they're feeding him that is so crazy where is that that doesn't seem like America

<timemark seconds="5625" />

is it South Korea wow so that's one of those wildlife parks with animals are off and you're in a car and it's like fake Wildlife Wildlife but not really wild yeah you're see that video where the lady was in China and they were in one of those parks and she got in a fight with her boyfriend she got out of the car and get killed by a tiger know she actually she didn't get killed her mom got killed she's more fucked up cuz your mom came out to rescue her she got snatched by the tiger and then her mom at wash it this is crazy another video of it and be like hey listen to get back in the fucking car this Tigers out here it's like not enough fuck you and fuck him and fuck you and the tiger describes are snatches Rob so the guy runs out and then the mom runs out and apparently the mom got killed here comes the mom that lady wind up dying

<timemark seconds="5824" />

Scranton grinder the sneaky that gangster like I saw my friends dear friend of mine lost both of his dogs to coyotes and he had I think he had like surveillance of it and one is in the yard and he's playing dead and then his a dog's approached what they think is dead and then basically like his homie comes out of nowhere and attacks in the end they both anyone is playing dad attacks and both of his dogs were wrap how big was dogs small I mean they were smaller dogs but you know he's kind of like got bigger dogs now but is really sad man. Very crazy figure out some way to work and cooperate together like if it wasn't so sad that they're killing someone's pet it's it's really kind of fascinating that they're so smart that they would play dead

<timemark seconds="5879" />

there's a guy that used to work at a pet store that I go to and he also worked in the Veterinary Center medical place and a Pitbull came in as big jacked Pitbull just covered in Cuts Cuts all over its body and the owner was the icing on it what the fuck happened cuz I don't know because I I came home is covered in real life no idea what happened to him so Stitch The Dog Out The Conjuring 2 Stitch Has all of the dark body then he takes a walk outside of his house and he follows his dog's blood and it goes up into the Hills near his house he finds nine dead coyotes

<timemark seconds="6075" />

that's so nasty man is that the color you like am at home at like charcoal Mercedes gray looks good which engine they put in there and Ellis 300K what is how many horsepower is that I think I'm at like seven hundred so ridiculous it's so ridiculous scene old schools I've actually really actually fell out of love with them it's kind of weird or I think I've spent like my time with them and I'm ready to like separate from them and move on and maybe like get other stuff for like I don't know I feel like it was a moment in time though I was like kind of like hoodrich and a sense where I put all my money into cars like before I ever bought a house I had like four caddies you know it was living in like a two-story two-bedroom house you know where the bunch of friends but did that old red one behind you is dope what is that I still have that 53 Chevy truck that looks bad

<timemark seconds="6753" />

icon does some of those to you ever see the thrift master of Masters one for somebody showing it isn't nasty Window Shop what have you met him he's very cruel he drove me there and was like hitting Corners at 70 like I fucking almost lost us like this motherfucker is crazy but they really do perform there go that fucking cars even my Bronco even though it's so high so high off the ground you would think that the handles like shit in handles really good for for something like that is it like stock how comes from Ikon like that same height or did you do anything to it yeah he just does a mall that way and I was originally going to get an FJ made from him and I went there I saw the Bronco in person with that Matt silver and I was like holy shit as like

<timemark seconds="6813" />

the fucking FJ we need to get this going so dumb did you do the whole bill. Like you know how it how long did it take for a long time and then I think the bill took close to a year is it close to a year or two or three nights a week since I got the Tesla I'm telling you man really ruined me it's ruined me I'm a Gearhead I like old school cars have a 65 Corvette LS1 supercharged ride that all the time side pipe I love it but it seemed so dumb it's like you're on Fast Forward I need to check it out buddy else's live in the past I used to have The Wraith Rolls-Royce car back

<timemark seconds="6873" />

I have the ceiling with all the lights look at my buddy my buddy Johnson at swap cars wherever we are driving so I did and I was really impressed it fucking it was really really fast which one of the 100 you know those were fast they're still fast but this one is fucking stupid it doesn't make sense it's like you it's like you're defying what you think of thing can do and has that big fucking screen Warehouse all your everything formation yeah he's definitely a man

<timemark seconds="6922" />

skip that fucking thing up in the hallway out here I'm so afraid my son's like put the fucking fuel in it and everything I was like alright thanks crazy he comes bearing gifts blowtorch, it's not a blowtorch right know what is a call it's not a tablet with a blowtorch

<timemark seconds="6957" />

is it crazy picture online that we put up of him shooting that fucking thing out in the hallway and you like you can't tell him no and I like no one tells him know he's got security around them and always fucking always mercenaries with guns

<timemark seconds="6975" />

yeah it's worth billions everywhere he goes I mean he's got out security everywhere guys come before him and case everything out yeah I look at them

<timemark seconds="6985" />

what an iconic photo

<timemark seconds="6988" />

what the freak party sign above his head it's almost like we planned it and Steven Tyler that Steven Tyler's mugshot in the background

<timemark seconds="6997" />

crazy man he's just like fucking stoned be honest I inhaled it took like a tiny puppy I think he popped it like a cigar really smokes weed he drinks we drank that's what was interesting about that the blowback or the backlash is that we drank for 2 hours before we in busted out the weed but the weed was like what am I doing hit of weed stock plummeted 6% then went back up 9%. If you don't smoke a lot and you smoke after you've been drinking

<timemark seconds="7045" />

I don't know I never seen it all to get affected him he's like me he's so his brain is wired so different you know what his brain is like it's like your seed like okay no disrespect the Pete Holmes Plano Pete Holmes comedian like look at his body and then look at Usain Bolt's that's how I feel like like the way if they had a race that's how I feel like with my brain in the room with elon's Brando cycle these are barely the same thing and whatever else like you you keep up with everybody it's an illusion memorize things what the fuck I'm talking about Concepts repeat things that I've learned but I don't know what the fuck I'm really talking about they know what the fuck do if someone never did Jujitsu before and they want to talk about choking someone out a triangle and I hear them say it

<timemark seconds="7105" />

play that's how you do it that's how you do it but they don't really know how to do it and I'm saying but if you talk to him he tells you how to choke someone out with trying like this all the time the different conversation you know so that's the difference like me I'm like a spectator talk of these Geniuses but I'm just trying to pull information out of them I'm just trying to get them to talk and I just try to know a little bit about what they're talking about the guys that were on last week of the guys that were talking about like longevity like living pretty crazy fascinating I'm glad there's people like that out there I think within the next 15 to 20 years people going to start going back in aging like legitimately going to be able to not just slow down aging but we're going to see like 60 year old ladies are hot as fuck year old lady looked at 32 I really believe that

<timemark seconds="7165" />

especially like every time I'm a diabetic medicine that he takes like metformin yeah yeah but apparently that stuff has negative impacts on athletic performance is one of the things that I was curious about when when he discussed it and dr. Rhonda Patrick sent me something on it and Ben Greenfield actually brought it up on the podcast we did a couple days afterwards yeah it's I don't think it's it's probably good for longevity but not good for athletic performance which is I'm not willing to make that sacrifice yeah he's probably not really concerned with that they perform a hard either he's like his his deal was like just maintain a little bit of exercise just to keep the blood moving but a lot of those guys that are these super-genius sort of longevity experts they're just interested in how you can slow the clock down as much as possible and then there's other people like Ben Greenfield or like Ron

<timemark seconds="7225" />

Patrick the more interested in performance like what is what's the best thing for you in terms of for your mental Performance Physical performance I'm more in line with that but I'm but I'm also I want to know what these guys are working on it like the Davidson players of the world because he's at the top of the tip of the spear when it comes to longevity in and Gene editing and you know what they're talking about is being able to inject certain what with but it was like certain genes or bacteria that carry genes it's going to fix eyesight yeah you're going to be able to see again like yeah they're going to be able to do some mad mad shit as long as human beings don't we don't figure out I mean we don't nuke ourselves or

<timemark seconds="7273" />

fuck the world to a point where you know scientific research halts if these guys can keep going if we can make it to the next 50 years people probably gonna live to be 300 years old nuts smart I love it I fucking smart people going to be at the 300 me think about how smart you are compared to when you were 20 yeah I was a dummy so dumb so dumb I'm amazed I'm still here like I stop and think about how I used to drive a submarine

<timemark seconds="7305" />

I know you have old schools do you have hot rods you be hot rods pretty much like Slow and Low like I just got rid of to my Impalas and I have like a 53 caddy I still have a 64/60 53 truck and a 41 caddy 41k it's nice man it's really fucking nice but it's like a 3-speed you know what I mean like it's like it's you know Noah old school power steering it's like 5 so yeah I still have a couple that I'm holding onto but I really were steamed steel giant gigantic is so sketchy to drive I have a I have a festival that happens in March called music that's like Tattoos music and cars by bring a couple of them out there where is that at Orange County fairgrounds

<timemark seconds="7365" />

nice nice so but yeah but I'm slowly I really just I don't know I want a simpler life man I want to be able to get in the car and not worry about it fucking breaks down and I can get to point A to point B without busy I am I don't know do is stay the fuck away from that Tesla yeah it'll ruin yours wow it's beautiful what a car like a just a car but a window in the time yeah that's history I mean back in 1941 that's what people drove man that was the shit back then people tooling around Manhattan in one of those play I love seeing those you know the movies that take place during those timers and they find all those Classics so cool the more recent version of The Great Gatsby with Leonardo DiCaprio when they drove those cars but it was a weird movie because they made those cars almost like modern is very strange that show Romeo and Juliet was to

<timemark seconds="7424" />

storm is Leonardo time. Correct right yeah so that's time. Correct but when he drove that car it drove like no fucking car I see if you find a scene where he actually drove the car because it sounded like it was super charge and it's flying and it's it's all like cartoonish almost like everything the scenes were like when they're driving these cars there's nothing like those cars were back then oh yeah cuz they don't move like that. Man didn't they had skinny ass bulshit tires they barely could break you hit the brakes it took forever to slow down

<timemark seconds="7481" />

upgrade movie though

<timemark seconds="7484" />

hey Alice is sick I see they're all going sideways around corners and shit nobody did that back then

<timemark seconds="7490" />

was weird that's weird how they do that with movies where they have this like they're having a race with that electric car outside will blow by these motherfucker

<timemark seconds="7504" />

the problem with those those Tesla's is that once you get in one other cars just seemed kind of dumb they seem kind of old that feel like it's your stepping in the future we have anything else wouldn't seem even up to date you know but there's something about cars like your 41 Cadillac that have a thing to him that you're never going to get from a new car and you know what's cool about those is like when you're in those you're not concerned with whatever's on the radio or talking on the phone or I don't know you're into just like you're content with just hearing the car I'm driving you know driving is fun yeah where is like you're just in a

<timemark seconds="7545" />

2019 Chevy truck you're not going to feel like that you know but it would take it that far back just the smell of them everything is it it's it it's a Vibe and it's just I don't know you can't compare it to anything when I bought my 65 Corvette the first thing to do is pull the radio out I said get that out of here I don't want to hear that radio outside pipes in the wind is going to be a thing of the past man I'd ever really firmly believe that now have to drive in this car I think you know 50 years from now those things are going to be it's going to be like seeing some guy with drive-by on a Model T engines are going to be a thing of the past probably better for the environment anyway overall

<timemark seconds="7588" />
