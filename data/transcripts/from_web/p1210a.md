<timemark seconds="470" />

The Joe Rogan Experience

<timemark seconds="479" />

so Tom Papa and I are sitting here and I say do you say did you see the fight on Saturday night and he said the guy that got knocked down mental health guy I didn't see the fight like we only saw the only saw that there's way too much information out there right like there's no way you can see every television show or watch every sporting event or or know every Scandal so when something happens like the blurb that the the little summary that I have watched it on Instagram he posted a thing and it was very heartfelt and he got up for all the people at mental health yeah I read that and I feel like I experience the whole thing but you know it's funny I don't know if you want to draw it was okay and I don't have a firm opinion on whether or not the the drawer was justified it once I thought I thought the

<timemark seconds="539" />

Tyson fewer one most of the rounds except the two that he got knocked down in Tysons the anti mental health guy says he's straight it is he's strange in that he has like the most freaky punching power I think I've ever seen ever that's what I heard too big guy I mean it weighs 212 lb looks pretty big but he should be shredded he has no fat on them whatsoever and that's where I was when I was like he's he's back in just a bundle of snakes around that was a fight where he was mostly losing he was mostly getting boxed up it was mostly getting out box but then he would land and he landed real hard and like boys like the 8th or the 9th something

<timemark seconds="599" />

some like I dropped them but that wasn't a big knock-down got up pretty quick and he was he was okay but in the 12th he fucking blasted him for the right hands in as he's falling Hymn of the left took on the chin as he was going down like he was laid flat on his back was armed up he looked unconscious you think that's really what he was thinking when you're getting up off the canvas I'm doing it for the kids never doubt him he he really. He's at he's in a very unusual guy and he donated his entire purse to charity like 8 million dollars really yeah yeah I donated all of it to charity holy cow that's great really unusual guy he was he's been in here

<timemark seconds="659" />

is in the podcast when he was gearing up for the fight so I should call him the super nice mental health guy he's a very nice guy very nice fish use a giant but he said it was super sweetheart your friendly guy it really well spoken and it's got that like heavy Travelers accent is a traveler that he made money before oh yeah he's so he's like he was the world champion bank and almost killed himself in a Ferrari almost committed suicide he was just headed towards a bridge and she's going to fucking either slam into the bridge or drive off the bridge that was his yeah I was going 60 miles an hour like headed towards the bridge and changed his mind. I looked that's what he look like before he started his comeback he was 300 pounds I want to see say you was

<timemark seconds="709" />

Isis yeah yeah something crazy

<timemark seconds="720" />

yeah oh my God he's so he was Champion he fell off and became a chubby well what happened was he beat Wladimir Klitschko who was a long-time heavyweight champion of flat Amir crabs and soundly outbox them in and beat him and then was like now what am I to a depression start drinking hard partying hard lot of cocaine and just fucked his life up just as the achieved what he wanted to achieve I mean he's calling it mental health you know because of depression those things but a part of me wants to say that a lot of that is it mean I don't know I've said never been inside of his head but yeah when you doing that much coke and drinking that much that is got to be a major factor why you feel like shit and then the letdown of this incredible achievement becoming heavyweight champ of the world beating this guy hadn't been beat in a long time many many many many years yeah

<timemark seconds="778" />

and then you know just partying too hard and then getting into a horrible Funk it is not deciding to come back so is that part of it where you know you know that you have that there are those personalities and there's genetics involved in it gets you into the drugs but then the drug start going to work on your brain and it then you know becomes something different than comes you know it's it's no longer your own Consciousness that's working it's this sponge that just absorb all of these toxins and who knows what's misfiring what's happening at that point we say that has we drank wine holidays do heroin of the holidays whatever who fucking messed I was going to bring you some wine today this is the open this is good stuff whatever this is I Don't Know Jack schitt about one I learned a great method for Thanksgiving about wine what's up I went to this place in La it's called 20/20 wine it's like this it's looks like Raiders of the Lost Ark at 10

<timemark seconds="838" />

405 and you just walk into wine this huge room racks and stuff it's so elegant just like this great place to be at school it's like temperature-wise it's like it's great and it's intimidating because they have you know I don't know that much about wine I want to but and I realize this was my strategy and it worked out perfectly I went to the guy who works there and I said look I have 12 people coming over for Thanksgiving

<timemark seconds="868" />

show me a $20 bottle of wine or less that I can buy a bunch of for my friends that's going to blow everyone away and he lit up like a Christmas tree it's like this is what he wants to do it's like yeah there's $200 bottles of wine we know what that is come with me and there it is and he took me into the back and he found please like this one's from Spain $18 no one knows it exists the best wine I've had all year

<timemark seconds="899" />

another one that is Italian barolo that nobody knows about a little goodness it's only $12 a bottle that goes Nobody Knows we have an extra case if it became like his of course that's what a wine guy wants to do is whine thing that a name is just as important as how good it is sure yeah like when people you know an opus one wine cigars are like that as well I know you are about to go I don't know much about cigars but I know more about cigars that I know about wine and like everybody wants Cuban hell yeah buddy wants something that's hard to get yeah but this was said that I was like how you should do it find a good wine shop and go to the guy who's waiting to be asked that question and he's so excited to show you what he learned and he works in a wine shop so he's not spending $500 for a bottle either me and my buddy my buddy Mark dellagrotte and I were in Florida where you can just very nice time restaurant with a bunch of people from the UFC

<timemark seconds="959" />

yeah we just said let's get a nice bottle of wine you have a nice bottle one that good bottles of wine but this place had like bought bottles of wine from the 70s right so I said alright let's go fucking crazy can I buy a bottle of wine from 1974 oh my God this is better this is Pastor this one's better it was like it was weird like I guess if you're a real connoisseur like part of it is like Roberto Duran was the champ when this was bottled it was like it felt like it had less alcohol and I think that's one of the things that maybe happens if the flavor sorts starts to morph and change it just felt less potent yeah almost more water down it wasn't that good dessert there still enjoyed it but I didn't love it right and that $4,000

<timemark seconds="1019" />

think was $1,000 bottle one-timer in about him and there are certain wines they say it like there certain brunellos that like those should age know she can go like 20 years and you know it will get even better 30 and then his other wines at that same amount of time they'll go sour and look at funky so it's so hard to tell but I downloaded it went down with that that would have been right on the board it's got a powerful it nice cuz that was like headed towards the board James name is anyone drinking I don't fuk with laptops in front of me anymore I've learned my lesson on Saturday my friend had a laptop she had a glass of water and a salad I'm bored

<timemark seconds="1079" />

sits at the gun here rest your head on the gun separated this was such a great way to do it like you can focus in on one kind of wine really kind of learn it and that's a lot like that would be a lot of studying to learn all of wine and like going to a fancy restaurant to be like I'm just going to pick from the Met You Can you know yeah you have to eat you really have to talk to someone is put in the time yes totally yeah that's something that I know a lot about pool cues right I know a lot about so if you believe you come to me and even you say hey I'm thinking about buying this pool cue what do you think I'm okay well here's what you need to know that's a very expensive pool cue and it's expensive because it's a collector's item cuz the guy who makes it is dead however in terms of like how it plays it does not play any better than pool cue the cost one small fraction of what that cost and I could turn you on to a bunch of custom pool cues

<timemark seconds="1139" />

anchors make a really good too for like a fraction of what you would pay for that cute and I'm telling you like you would play with this to you and be happy with her for the rest of your life but it won't cost you you know $500 as opposed to this cues that are 15 thousand $20,000 and fed up cuz I feel really ornate and beautiful one and this is a lifetime your adult lifetime of learning about the job I started playing pool in 1990 - 91 90 91 that's when I probably bought my first pool cue so it's a long-ass what's a good pool cue for bumper pool my neighbors had a bumper pool table when I was a kid it was badass it's pretty stupid he was the dominant one because he was able to jump it over the bumpers and get them is a very controversial thing in the world the pool

<timemark seconds="1199" />

well you can't buy the Tigers jumping and in this bar table jumping right like when you play with people on a bar they think they're jumping the pool too but what they're doing is that did the scooping under the cue ball is there a what their tip like they go under it and it sort of makes the cue ball pop up in the air it's really like yeah miscuing is what it's like the way you're supposed to jump a ball is shoot down on it and make it hop over haha yeah that's that's a McDermott it's like call the Excalibur or some shit like that it looks like a sickle that the Grim Reaper comes to that was made a long time ago was made back in the fucking 90s or something but that's not the most expensive pool cue in the world is that whole thing that I really

<timemark seconds="1248" />

that's not the most expensive shoe in the world no no the most expensive shoe in the world is a genic you Jeannie Q is actually right here in North Hollywood that's they call it the most expensive car in the world it's nonsense that's not really it's a cute that hole all the blades and everything like that what would you do with nonsense nonsense I'm telling you it's not blue diamonds on it and a half pounds very heavy cute very heavy is 21 Oz I'll give you play with it like you find out that a pro plays that 21-oz to be like wow was that thing is nine and a half pound piece of shit the gigantic boobs

<timemark seconds="1308" />

when you're like I really like triple z boobs and that's just not a real pool in North Hollywood well he makes his name is Ronnie koteras and he makes all sorts I have one of those cute cheeks I mean to share her knee is I mean he's like a real innovator in the world of pool cues he makes beautiful beautiful beautiful but he had one that he made that was filled with like I thought I want to say what that material was my bleeding on a bear Avery handle the handle was made out of solid Ivory I think it had a gold and all sorts of other shipment they went for a half million dollars it's worth a half million dollars but I think the deal is that he won't sell it he's very welcome that's really well like in Japan and also all throughout Asia

<timemark seconds="1368" />

the really revered like he sell his stuff anywhere on his keys are very expensive on the aftermarket tube to make some all by hands like that kind of thing well he designs the mall and then he uses computer-controlled machines are called CNC machines to put everything together peace it so that everything's perfect wow yeah but they're all like his designs and that like 3D printing know what it is is like you have a design and you put it into this computer and you you put the I don't know hundred percent of the process but rent you put your the specifications like how why do you want inlays to be in and they make them exactly the same size and the points fit exactly the same way yeah it's all super comp kids. But the point is like if you were a guy who wanted to buy a pool cue

<timemark seconds="1420" />

and you just went to a website you're right you're lost you lost like me trying to buy wonder why it's got this good wine though what is very good this is big news I didn't know you didn't have these crazy riots what's up everytime I think about visiting Paris there's a some new shit that goes down over there right now it's kind of like a jewel box that is about to explode a good man is it's not good thing is everyone is riding is wearing those reflective vests like see that yeah that is wearing a yellow reflective vest and light things on fire and smashing store so like who is Gucci in these these protesters they've been

<timemark seconds="1480" />

<timemark seconds="1540" />

shipwreck ass don't you understand the American way piece of shit I love talking about

<timemark seconds="1553" />

the price of fuel that's it $0.30 a gallon it went crazy $0.30, trying to kill people gas already cost about $7 per gallon with France fuck that so it's just going to break people's backs and then I can't remember it when I was leaving office Nick Jack the fucking price of gas weigh up yeah dude that empty the number alright that's right yeah

<timemark seconds="1588" />

assholes that you go to jail but that's that's kind of like that when when we would spike and people couldn't eat my God that's a shity little car anyway he's not even part of the protest he's just somebody was telling me about this I was at a little kids party I was talking one of the dads and he was telling me about this

<timemark seconds="1619" />

stop thing that happened this I think it was in Northern California it was a fire might not have been Northern California was a fire and the initially they thought it was just a fire but then the CEO and his vice president were both of their houses caught fire so then they thought it was like an attack on both people than they realize no is a murder and one of the guys killed the guy and his family and then let his house on fire and then went back to his house and let his own house on fire to make it look like they were going after both of them and he's the only one that survived a guy home family yeah and then let the house on fire. Maybe that's it maybe I'm getting a fucked-up version the story I get drunk the kid parties too it's the only way to go buy a massive fire New Jersey

<timemark seconds="1679" />

yeah that's it this is a story so make that a little larger please it says it was more than brotherly bond between Paul and Keith yeah that's right part of New Jersey and settled about 11 miles from each other in the suburbs New Jersey but two days before Thanksgiving are horrific chain of events would forever tear them apart always brother yeah that's what it is not really fucked-up person of the story Paul how do you say that name Canario brother his sister-in-law and their children so it's fucked up like what what how does a guy go from never killing anybody to killing a wife and daughter killed his brother and his brother's whole family with his wife and daughter inside try to make it look at the whole family been

<timemark seconds="1739" />

his family got out of the home safely. Can you imagine the Panic like what the fuck is can you imagine like while your lighting your house on fire thinking like the intensity of this is going to work I'm going to get out of this is where the plan goes and person kill I mean I understand you're mad at a guy and you fucking hate each other fuck you fuck you and you start fighting and then you wind up killing each other how do you kill his wife and daughters how do you do that I would like what's which goes on like is he just trying to

<timemark seconds="1779" />

yeah cuz he's just walking around little bit go back up it says it's killed his sister-in-law it said he's accused of killing his younger brother his sister-in-law and their children like how many children like who is he killed kids never murdered anybody just walking around Colts Neck Township New Jersey probably never done anything really major in his life right probably wake was at a like a business meeting like 2 days before with some guy in his life talk about the Giants like what the fuck what is his wife and his two daughters

<timemark seconds="1816" />

I know several twist in the case of a rattle on porch that then allegedly said his own home on fire with his wife and his daughters inside did you not hear me say that his brother's family no no he killed his brother and family set the house on fire on fire then let his own house on fire to make it look like he was being targeted I knew that but I didn't know his kids and his wife and his daughters were inside oh my God I try to make it look as if his whole family being targeted his brother and him oh my God it's finally got out of the home safely

<timemark seconds="1850" />

wow fucking unbelievable about his kids right now we're like what to do what Jesus Christ oh my God

<timemark seconds="1861" />

what am I for was killed before Sunrise scroll up there somewhere between midnight and 5 a.m. Paul Kenny Arrow was walking around his brothers 1.5 million dollar Colts Neck home armed with a knife and a gun

<timemark seconds="1876" />

oh yeah yeah yeah husband in front of the white mansion with a deadly confrontation unfolded Paul fired multiple shots strike and Keith fucking when you got mad at me for not following the story clearly did you feel like you could kill me and I'm not yet I need more anymore

<timemark seconds="1894" />

Jesus Christ walked inside found his wife's found Keith's wife Jennifer he shot and stabbed her and then stab their children Jesse 11 and Sophia 8/10 he took some documents instead of fire in the basement

<timemark seconds="1912" />

what were they doing like the week before and stabbed an 8 year old dude an 8 year old girl in her sleep how to how to fuck to someone in their sleep insane or sleep well it was 5 a.m. doesn't matter man use those gunshots in the house yeah

<timemark seconds="1930" />

oh my God good Lord what a monster I'm a monster what was this guy like the month before like what the hell is that normal looking house shit that is the normal us looking normal house ever do you believe that there is an always a presence of Good and Evil in the world like like that it's not just evil Deeds what this guy did was evil but do you believe that there is a real presence of evil that it's like a thing that

<timemark seconds="1967" />

takes over people or takes over you know what I mean like like like like good and evil is that more than just people's actions where is it like a force of nature is there a good force of Nature and an evil force of nature that is constantly using people and using things as as a catalyst story for as I locate instrument let's break this down I don't think Nature's the right way to approach it because I don't think is good or evil in nature I think nature nature is actually far more moral than humans are because what would nature is just about survival right and predators and prey and they kill things need things but when animals in nature kill like what they call Surplus killings were wolves were killed like 18 elk and not not eat them they're just they're just going on their instincts these things are there to be killed and they they can get them cuz they can't run away maybe it's fixed now or something like that so they just can't help it they just tearing apart cuz they're instincts are good drive them to kill cuz that's how they survive

<timemark seconds="2027" />

Southern family survives they're killing in there they're eating these out and this is just what they do and even if they kill a bunch of them where they can't eat them and their instinct is to kill because that's how they survive it's natural it's normal with humans it's very different because we humans is consequences right and there's a law and there's other humans finding out so there's deception and then there is your selfishness and is the the fear of getting caught and then there's your own your own Survival Instincts internally don't want to get locked up in jail you don't want to get caught or something so I think if I had to guess that this guy didn't think he was going to kill this guy's wife and family probably don't even think he's going to kill this guy they probably got into a heated argument and they they're stupid and he know he's skinny that's my people do stupid your people too they do stupid shit you know people and those those fiery people

<timemark seconds="2087" />

Italian girls and I was 21 and go take a swing at me when I was 21 I was like that's it for me I'm done like I'm not hitting one back this is just too fucking kooky some some like it some fun and some women are fucking crazy and I I buy believe in epigenetics and I see how wacky my fucking on kids are what's epigenetics epigenetics Willis what's Google's I don't bust up the the actual definition but essentially it's the way I'm using it is that there's a certain traits that are not just environmental traits that are inherited traits and that you will pull them right the study the changes in organisms caused by the modification of gene expression rather than the alteration of the genetic code itself this better is better words in that is better better definition send that

<timemark seconds="2138" />

the study of heritable changes in gene expression to go active versus inactive genes that do not involve changes to the underlying DNA sequence a change in the phenotype without a change in the genotype which in turn affects how cells read the genes oh great now I know less about it I think there's traits and this is this is a very

<timemark seconds="2163" />

is a very controversial yet very fascinating field of study because what they're doing is there they're finding out that children that are twins that are separated by you know when they're babies it going to different foster homes in the Rays by different families have incredibly remarkably similar to Love's desires like what they're interested in incredibly simple yeah and they are suspecting that a lot of the infant like you we are combination of Nature and nurture I think that's safe to say and I think that do you certainly are a lot of things happened to kids when they're young that shape their life whether it's physical or sexual abuse with their exposure to violence or whether is positive things like love and encouragement and inspiration but there's certain information I think that's transferred from the

<timemark seconds="2223" />

parent to the child while the child is in the womb and one during during the conception the child I think is traits that come from the father and traits that come from the mother biological biologically and I think this is undeniable cross-species I think this is why dogs like my dog has no fucking idea who his parents are you just give a shit, I grabbed that leash and he's like we running today dad and his I haven't but it's it's about this exact very thing right started yeah it was it was it supposed to be good

<timemark seconds="2269" />

it's on Netflix why did he leave me

<timemark seconds="2279" />

no but he's got certain instincts like you lift up his leg to piss on things so yeah I smell things like the end and he chases squirrels like there's there's things there and he's retriever tries to Golden Retriever so he brings things back whenever I had Pit Bulls before and they'll bring things back if you got to teach them they don't want to bring things back they definitely don't want to let go natural for hair that soft mouth yes yeah yeah class yeah same thing the whole thing's gently because they're used to retrieving ducks and animal on pheasants the people shoot that's what they were raised for when I get him up in the morning right he stays in this little room and when I get up in the morning at 7 to take my kids to school and stuff like when I open up the door he whines like crazy gets crazy wags his tail so happy to see you the first thing he does is pick up a toy in his mouth like you said this is not something that we talked him

<timemark seconds="2339" />

golden retrievers all around the world doing the same exact thing all around the world all around the same exact thing is certain traits yeah and I believe that aliens might my people my people I'm not saying this. And yours too I'm mostly Italian there Savage folk this is just a fact man that's why I really absolutely 100% believe yeah I think there are certain civilization to have a longer history of being civilized and and less violence and I think when you are we dealing with folks that have in a real History of Violence in their culture and that this translates generation to generation transfers down to the children right now I think this guy is part of that I mean it's like there's not it's not a coincidence that the Italian mob so ruthlessly brutal for the Russian mob so we have to be

<timemark seconds="2399" />

excuse me know for sure there's definitely that part of it and then there's the other part of it they like you said there's there's the nurture part of it who knows what was going on in the skies life okay so here we have two Italian brothers right raised the same way Italian hot streak all this thing and then my brother together the family Italian guy didn't have that in his to-do list but not necessarily because I don't know if they planned it out or if he did it just because we had a knife on him and a gun maybe it was crazy assholes that brought a knife and a gun everywhere who fuck no but they were in business together and your people in business together it's not they get crazy and they get real resentful and you know they think one person is not doing their fair share one person fucks up a dealer one person's cost in the money and you kill each other so there is no year old daughter

<timemark seconds="2459" />

yeah I have no idea what the Italians also like wine more wine please 0% alcohol I've never had it is supposed to be the most delicious non-alcoholic beer alcohol is Heineken 0-0 so Heineken 00

<timemark seconds="2492" />

tastes like Heineken does this is literally no difference pretty damn good for non-alcoholic beer does know that weird I'm lying to myself Funk to it

<timemark seconds="2504" />

yeah it doesn't have that weird aftertaste if I was a junkie I would not want to try opiate free heroin alcoholic drink non-alcoholic beer you literally the Gate of Hell yeah and then the fucking demons are reach that crap myself everything okay

<timemark seconds="2544" />

to question will the marijuana thing is different because I think for the vast majority of human beings obviously there's a lot of biological diversity but for the vast majority of human beings I do not think that marijuana is physically addictive I think it's entirely possible that for some people it is but I think for the vast majority people it is not physically addictive it's more psychologically addictive so I think it's a different thing so they're taking CBD what they're really depends on how they're taking the role of a CV joint some CBD have a little bit of THC it has the tiniest amount of alcohol test alcohol free but I think it's like what are the hero 0.04 alcohol-free beer with natural flavoring do you know a Heinekens one of the few beers that you can drink if you are a Celiac

<timemark seconds="2604" />

it does not have wheat it's not a wheat-based beer so if you're gluten-free you can drink Heineken maybe not if you're Celiac but definitely if you're gluten-free that's not bad I like it calories is honey not at all it's not bad but back half the calories of a standard beer so those other calories are just pure alcohol

<timemark seconds="2625" />

yeah right what if it's like a you know there's one episode of the Opie and Anthony show

<timemark seconds="2636" />

oh my God I forgot about that we gave this gal who should they had this I think it was her name is stalker Patti I mean I was going to be a member of this crazy radio shows have these regulars this one gal a breath strip like a standard Listerine breath strips and this is back in the day when I used to get pot breath strips that would they would fuck you up so hard I remember I gave a half of one to Tom Segura and we flew to Florida 2 gigs together and by the time we landed is like dude I want to tell you something I almost didn't make it

<timemark seconds="2680" />

you start freaking out freaking out half of a breast you would put you in an alternative Dimension it was so strong so we gave this gal a regular breast have a video of it online already gave her this breath strip and then re proceeded to like to talk to her and she was like talking about oh Hai she was and she so fucked up she couldn't go anywhere but we all knew that she was sober that's what they choose when you're a person who's like a whack Packer right answer something is an issue that's not being resolved actualized human being now do that yes he's not an actual human be right there shit together then they're reading self-help books and fucking getting up at 5 and doing yoga and they just trying to get through the day

<timemark seconds="2740" />

the barely getting through the other found this thing that makes them the date they cling to him and other things would like those characteristics of these people that find something to belong to and then they become a thing they become apart of that thing you would find those people at pool halls you find those people at martial arts places you find those people that hang out at comedy clubs it's like they're a little off but they find a thing yeah that becomes their the thing that they do all the time if they're not like the comedian they'll hang out at the comedy you know those folks right for sure and I don't I totally get it I mean that's Community like just want to belong somewhere we all want that thing that's where I go and I know those faces and they know me and maybe I'm not totally apart of it but I can go to the pool hall and yes feel like I went I was wanted on my home the pool hall was a perfect place for that because it was a hangout

<timemark seconds="2800" />

a lot of people weren't playing as you have like three or four tables going there like so 3 or 4 tables would be like six or eight people playing pool but there might also be five or six people just hanging out maybe playing cards maybe you're buying coffee and maybe ordering a sandwich or something like that just sitting there eating it's important you know that that's a whole article about that by David Brooks the other day and he was saying that that's that economically were richer than we've ever been as a country and even in the last couple years like poor people like everyone's standard of living is gone up which I wasn't really clear on I thought that you know only the rich people we're doing we're getting richer but everybody was kind of being lifted up but we're on happier than ever before and the life expectancy is lower than ever before and we're killing ourselves at rates that are higher than ever before and he was saying that it's that lack of community that we don't go to church anymore we don't belong

<timemark seconds="2860" />

those things that gave us meaning every day in our town and used to go to church you go to the pool hall you go to that you need that sense of belonging and work is a big part of it when people now or in the skate Academy in there working over there working seamless they're doing different things there isolated by themselves and not working with other people and it's he really believes that if that lack of community in that lack of Institutions is why were very very unhappy as a as a country right now it makes sense to me it makes sense to me as a person is a part of a vital Community as a comedian with me he said I almost feel like I'm a comedian more than I'm an American I'm not going to comedian first American second gear at the airport and you know you run into Dave Attell or whoever it is like it's like that's like there's a light upon

<timemark seconds="2920" />

them yeah I'm down from heaven exactly one of mine who didn't embrace me like as soon as you said he was like this something where we are with this guy something like that don't have any comic friends yeah very weird I can't even like figure out exactly what it is but I'm just like I know that's not it one of the good ones especially if someone's like a successful comedian year of their ass and you give them a pass it's like family it's like to know if I had to this gig in the in Colorado wants and just by chance was like was corporate thing in there was another comic on the bill so I won't mention and I was like oh that's cool we're in the middle of like nowhere and at least there's another comedian here he did a set split didn't talk to me just like there was no I was like I was like your

<timemark seconds="2980" />

your dog like hey let's play weird or something and I know it's true then it was back in the day and this is another thing that I talked about with the with Jeff and Dave's we're talking about camaraderie that there's there's less competition now there ever was before being before it was only a limited number of Tonight Show slots it was a limited number of sitcom ride could be on and that's what everybody wanted everybody wanted their own sitcom everybody wanted to be on The Tonight Show and they're very few of those very few and everybody's competing for these very limited slots and they are very few HBO special it was a buzz not there wasn't a lot and it was a lot of us and so it led to a lot of like jealousy lot of clawing and scratching thanks too many things thanks to the Internet thanks to YouTuber initially then podcast and then Netflix it seems like the world is our oyster there's so much

<timemark seconds="3040" />

content totally and you could have your own audience and you can have his own audience exist without having to poach each other. And you know I promote like in the beginning of if you listen to this on YouTube it's not on it because it's something I do in the beginning of the audio version of it but I know I'm always talking about people's specials that are out like that now that bumping Mike special with Dave and Jeff Ross is out now you're not paying me to say that Netflix is not mean to say that they're not paying for all my friends and I want them to prosper you want I want everything to I want them I think they're great and I want everybody to know that this is great stuff and if you if you're a fan of Comedy I want to help you I want to be that guy at the wine store going to hate that you wanted to see an $18 bottle of wine will knock your dick in the dirt and chill EDM

<timemark seconds="3094" />

nobody knows about it you're going to love it will more people know about Joey now than ever I'm never seen anybody that makes me laugh harder I don't know if I if I enjoy him as much as I want as much as I enjoy how much you enjoy have

<timemark seconds="3117" />

really it's such a great thing it just watching you guys when he's going off and you're laughing at him it's just it's like I could watch that all day I feel so thankful he's so real he such a I mean it's just one of those so real I have a buzz I got a couple drinks smoke a little weed and I watch Joey I'm so thankful I'm so so so thankful does a guy like that out there in my opinion he's that that the leader of the charge cuz he's the most Reckless and wild and even more so now that he is a fucking monster right now he's like these Pekingese better than he was before he was the best before now it's such a great thing like when you go to any club and then you come in on you to see whatever random people are there in my wife is a comedian before we had kids and the first thing she wants ass she asked when I come back as who who was there who did you see

<timemark seconds="3177" />

like always so stubborn and whatever and she's like out she wants because she doesn't she's not part of the community like she is when she doesn't get to visit so it's like she misses that sense and we were very lucky to have that has grown man to be able to like walk into this very fun community that you're a part of a sense of belonging and that's what a lot of people don't have nowadays if it's very according to David Brooks that's the reason for everybody is malaise I think there's certainly something to that I think it's weird living in places where you don't know your neighbors you know and that's that's fucking weird yeah Norton was telling me that he lives in this big apartment building in New York City and I think he's I mean it's got to be hundreds of people living in that build how easy he would build a yeah I know anybody weird says not does know anybody says try to say hi to his neighbor they looked at him like he's a fucking murderer

<timemark seconds="3231" />

nobody's friendly to anybody yeah weird they're like you're too loud stop making noise that's what everybody does to be will bang on the door banging the floor but it's a weird thing and it's weird you know my my youngest wants to go to church and how old 13 and friends what is maybe she has more of a she's as more of a sensitivity in like she knows there's something other than there's something spiritual going on in mushrooms I think I might have the whole thing off and she's just she's searching a little bit and she wants that she likes being able to sit someplace and and we go and it's not like when I was a kid like when I was a kid and we were catholic the place was packed but you couldn't find parking like it was like it was a big deal that my father would be like we're going early

<timemark seconds="3291" />

I'm not walking from the back and it was like a big thing and now it's like a kind of roll up it's half full and there's nobody there and it's you know of course the Catholic church is a lot of problems and pink but every put every evening my promise to put all these religions have had this the worst but I know but don't let me know so much now and we're able to see that all these institutions are flawed but they said there's problems with all them used if people used to think my grandmother just thought church is the best in this is the last time they didn't ask questions now we know everything and we know that all these institutions are flawed and I think we're making a mistake that you can't be a part of a political party you can't be a part of a community you can't be apart of thing if it's not perfect but that's not the way to live you got to kind of be a little ignorant if you're going to show up you got

<timemark seconds="3351" />

kind of not being ignorant but the loud things to be flawed start a new one go on yeah I mean the right way to address the issues of a flawed institution and not just accept them but to try to create a new institution that does not have many flaws we know that's not what we did but what our founding fathers did when they established the United States of America the idea was to establish a place where you have an experiment in self-government and that's never existed before in the world and this is what the United States represents to the rest of the world outside of us mean this is what we again I keep saying wait it's not a week but with the people that established the United States did was they broke the mold as to how a world superpower or a country it was a country could exist and then that country I mean I don't think it's a coincidence that out of just a couple hundred years that country emerged the greatest superpower the world ever known

<timemark seconds="3411" />

I think that freedom allows unprecedented activity in terms of innovation in terms of creativity and not being suppressed and not being in total fear for your life for any form of descent so any and this is this goes back to not just religion but any sort of any group any any any group that's in control of any sort of a situation as soon as you suppress all the other people you you limit their ability to contribute right right this is what is existed all throughout Europe and what existed all throughout Asia all throughout the rest of the world yeah when the United States came along and then when the United States came along all the sudden you have is unprecedented development and growth in this one place where people allowed to be free yeah where we support for expression will we will support freedom of speech for your freedom of religion and we separate church and state

<timemark seconds="3471" />

so important so when you get like religious fundamentalists wackos it say this is country was founded on Christian values that doesn't matter if you're a peaceful Buddhist if you're a peaceful Mormon whatever the fuck it is we should all Embrace each other we should help each other a hundred percent freedom in as soon as someone starts restricting that freedom and restricting people's ability to express themselves you running the real problems because then you don't let these things play out in their natural order you don't let ideas play out where people get to examine those ideas and change like if you look at some of the most impressive areas of the Middle East the real problem is that these people live not just this many real problems but one of the real promises people live in fear so there's no real freedom of expression and is also this real desire for Conformity is real desire to establish that you are a part of the group that is one of the good ones that's going to abide by the rules and you are going to show everyone else

<timemark seconds="3531" />

that you were a part of this group weather means throwing gay people off buildings or throwing rocks at women are just going to say and the other day who's gay and he was saying that you have a boyfriend now so close wow I didn't realize he can't go to half of the planet as an open game at oh yeah can't go to Russia he can go to the all of the Middle East like they will kill you if your gay in those areas I mean talk about I mean what's going to make City flourish then gay people coming in with parts of New York like it was nobody's business what's great about gay folks is wenge folks are embraced and they're allowed to be themselves

<timemark seconds="3591" />

oh my God I can express that and then you get to see that like there's a there's such a giant spectrum of the way people behave and thank in the things that they love and if you don't allow people to express their position on that Spectrum then you don't even know it exists right then you create all sorts of deviance because you know you're forcing them into the some unnatural pattern which is one of the things that I think about the Catholic church I think part of the problem is that these people are suppressed sexually like incredibly suppress not just suppress terms of whether their homosexual or heterosexual but there's no sex you're not allowed to have any sex right yeah so how's it going to come out it's fucking insane it's like since being in denial of the fact that you need to drink water and it's so upsetting because I'm really kind of searching a little bit because I was raised Catholic and I did like going I have what she has I did like going and sitting in the Pew on Sunday was different from the other days and I asked if I got to hear people talk

<timemark seconds="3651" />

stop being nice to each other and we got to see the people from my town who you saw her running around with now they just sitting there quietly and praying there is goodness to it and they went out and fed the homeless there was a good stuff that came from and she wants that I get that and now you're sitting in an institution though then you know the backstory what's going on it's you know how do you sit there how do you sit there sometime I go to Bikram Yoga I go to hot yoga 90 minute hot yoga and that guy I don't think he's allowed to come in this country think he's a stress case you got a little rapey well he definitely got a little he took advantage of his

<timemark seconds="3711" />

privilege his position hour well yeah I guess you could say power but the reference that people had towards him they felt like he was a Gruen so he could get these girls alone and he would make him suck his dick or whatever but I think I'm getting this very dangerous Waters but I was having a conversation with a woman who is a she's an actually an instructor and she said listen that guy is definitely creepy but let me tell you something a lot of those girls not only knew what he was about but they wanted to be with him they wanted to be with him because of his power and because he represented something special to them and then when he just like shot a load their mouth and kicked him to the curb then they became angry and decided they were molested they went into it willingly I do not know if she's accurate or inaccurate and I was not there and I'm not a woman but I do know that people have

<timemark seconds="3771" />

I remember women throwing knife throwing themselves but making it like very clear that they were at they had deep admiration for my martial arts instructor when I was when I was a young kid and I was practicing Taekwondo yeah I remember these women they were so in awe of my martial arts instructor who sang represented the master of something that they were deeply enamored by and I think that's also what happened to these yoga people yeah it's seductive yes you know it's seductive and also with something like that it's very physical and mental and spiritual it's it's sexual sexual yoga is Almost Naked I am wearing these little fucking shorts and the girls wearing little shorts and and the teacher goes around and she like called you out it's like oh she likes me guess I can understand how some of those people

<timemark seconds="3831" />

intimate with each other after this is all over because there are so close to being naked and sweating together right you know your friend is right in that there were some women I'm sure who wanted to be with him yes but it seems dismissing anyway Beach it either but it's because he has the power and knows what he's wielding like in a workplace kind of thing it's up to you to be the one to put the brakes on it that's where it gets interesting is he does not seem to think that he does have any responsibilities at all for the people that are working for him teaching these classes and Jeff like he was he was fucking did they do this HBO interview about him it was so ridiculous is the big day 1 million dollars for one drop of my sperm

<timemark seconds="3878" />

he says this TV can find a video so he's fully aware he's fucking crazy missing the idea that he would ever sexually assault anyone he's like why would I do that when these women that will pay $1000000 for one drop of my sperm well it wasn't you at why wasn't

<timemark seconds="3906" />

yeah it wasn't brought Bryant Gumbel wasn't there did I think they're discussing it right you're discussing the 7th, you got to see the guy cuz he looks like a cuz he said the comment to a woman and she was like that she was like what in the fuck did you say you put the holy shit yeah there's some things that are would call it that you would call Beyond The Pale your grandpa he's like all loose skin and he's balding and

<timemark seconds="3959" />

but that's the thing it's like when you're in a power of a powerful position like that he's very spiritual and people will pay $1000000 from being circumspect a real sport the seven-year-old went off on a rant claiming 5000 women a day want to sleep with him for have committed suicide over his charms and people would pay $1000000 for a drop of his sperm see everyday and then retire have you if you just drank ate a lot of zinc

<timemark seconds="3997" />

a lot of zinc and like what makes loads oysters celery celery people celery Lobby yes celery in the world you have to sleep with women and have to sleep now $5,000 everyday to 5000 women today want to sleep with you

<timemark seconds="4036" />

you commit suicide you're saying it for different women each killed himself because you wouldn't have sex all the time why people's been $1000000 for one drop of my sperm I can make million-dollar idiot dumb delete dust trash women in the trash and give them life

<timemark seconds="4072" />

oh my god really looks pretty good for 70 gross yeah they get gross do you know why I know man so that spiritual thing like the whole but that's yeah yeah it's like the problem with it is you're still an animal right so if the animals like we were talking about before with Wolves gummy Surplus kills and they kill all these Alchemy don't eat them again Wyoming was a recent issue there's 18 elk that were killed by wolves in the Surplus killings the real tragedy

<timemark seconds="4115" />

these walls can help themselves just their instincts so his instincts as a man he has instincts to procreate write his instincts to respond to women that are sexually attracted to him and he teaches his classes in front of the hundreds and thousands of people and everybody loves and adores him so his fucked up Twisted Brain everything that he said they're made sense my favorite part of it was that woman Andrea when she when she clarified so you're saying you're saying that for women have committed to it like this motherfucker has to be clear I change your expression she's just so you're saying yeah I mean look at that girl right now he's standing on top of a woman's hips as she's bent over backwards that girl is like he wants me he standing over me this is a take a lot of yoga classes no beer still in my hips now. Hey bro

<timemark seconds="4175" />

oh shit I just spilled I spell just leave it there bro good for the patina Soul it out there so when you're in the church the church of yoga or realtor in you're abusing your power and that's a different animal because you're abusing with children that so now it's a totally different animal and then we taking 6 year olds and abusing them it's a different animal yeah you know I mean like it's like there's levels to this shit right like the guy killing his brother is horrific to me the guy killing his brother's wife more horrific guy killing his brother's wife and then kids impossible demonic it's like that it was you saying earlier like you believe in good or evil I don't know if I believe in it but if it did exist exist in the mind of men yeah I exist and in that time you know it's him know and it was about men's rights

<timemark seconds="4235" />

groups in his I was trying to figure out a way to say this and make it be funny but it's so true that I said men commit most of the Murder Men commit most of the men cause all the war these are facts like the most horrific things in our life our war murder rape those are the most horrific things in comparison and I think men steal more than women to but that that's the evil this is if there was a demon in the demon came down to earth and enjoyed three things that I could get you to do it would get you to rape murder and cause more of a demon was real I said this is a joke that I get feminist it look in the specials like I get it if I was a femicide B12 I can't be one as a man cuz they're not real cuz like male feminists like they just tricksters they're just like show me a male feminist that can pick up heavy things and run really fast

<timemark seconds="4294" />

you don't exist to give a limited parameter where you're allowed to be a male feminist but yeah but I got it and I look at the actions of men if you're an objective person you take yourself out of the human race and you look at all all human beings and you look the horror that men that women haven't done awful shit and falsely accuse people and killed their kids and would have done all those things some women some but the vast majority of Horrors yeah I've been I've been look at the world that there's good and evil in it exist in the certain way it's hot that's good it's all good alright but a little bit of that don't keep praying I'm worried that I won't be funnier after I do this

<timemark seconds="4343" />

do you like Elon Musk your goddamn pairing pioneer

<timemark seconds="4351" />

Jamie's going for 3 I think so 3 Jamie has hip problem if you if you see a video of the floor

<timemark seconds="4358" />

Katrina hit the wrong button. Federally right that's always funny about the Elan thing when you on smokes it here it was like

<timemark seconds="4377" />

it's totally legal it's totally okay but in everyone's minds they're still like no it's not you need to let it go and let it go on your side you know I'm on like this that did the good people of government law enforcement fire department military the good people. I'm on your side man and I'm a stoner I'm on your side million percent and making it legal to actually helps all that because now you don't have to go ask like he's phony Wars against it just do that it makes people more compassionate people look it's like everything else you can abuse beating off you know I remember when I was

<timemark seconds="4419" />

the drop $1000000 for one drop of my sperm you know if you're a person that gets obsessed with masturbation yeah but you can ruin your life people that are being torn addictions where they watch porn 18 hours a day I can't stop yourself with food you can ruin yourself with with laziness you can you can get into a habit will you just can't get up you know you can you can get into a comfort zone we just want to take baths all day you know yeah there's did Roseanne say she did that after all of her bullshit went down she's got in the bath all the time drink wine

<timemark seconds="4467" />

but I know it's a very basic way I mean we've been talking about Good and Evil since the time of the men were able and women were able to you know right and it's in philosophizing but it it I don't know it just seems to me lately like I've see it feels to me like evil and good is actually a force that were struggling with I and I know there's some people would say that's kind of you know A Primitive way of thinking but I do kind of feel like it actually is a very real tangible thing and that what makes you think this look up your personal feelings is it based on like your intuition like what is it

<timemark seconds="4514" />

idx intuition it's like a Vibe it's like a it's just like a maybe because I'm showing up at church and kind of like searching a little bit myself and I I am very much about good people doing good things and I've just been kind of conscious of it but then there's always like these this rise of evil that like comes up like all sudden white supremacist for these riots are these horrible things against people in different parts of the world and it's caught up yet the way you look at the world through a lot of people look at the world lot of people in the world like like if Tom Papa if you were in charge if you had to push all the buttons that would sort of

<timemark seconds="4558" />

decide how people behave development that was a possible thing of course she does want the first thing you do is eliminate all the violence of the horrors of the world yeah and if you could see the all those hearts are done by these men and some who you when you sit in like kind of analyze them and they in the victims of a lot of things and there's like genetic victimization and social and it's like so where's that coming from why are these this kid that could have been okay ends up in this life of crime and end up murdering somebody and where's that coming from is this just a genetic mutation or is there like a force of

<timemark seconds="4596" />

good and evil I think we're still we're still dealing with the Echoes of the past that's what I really firmly believe and I think also the way maybe you and I are having this conversation the way a lot of people having these conversations today just like us but basically the same sort of rational people sitting around with No Agenda going wisest exist why why does all the horrors of Life why why is all this Injustice why is that there I think this is we haven't been here that long I just really think that's that's real and I think we need to absorb that much better are our time spent in modern civilization versus the time of life on Earth is a joke the time on life on Earth and in relationships the time of the universe is a joke. The numbers are insane yeah I can understand that we we we literally were monkeys just a couple weeks ago right but yeah the bit that I have my ACT about the United States being found in 1776 yeah

<timemark seconds="4656" />

three people ago ago people were these creatures that had to make fire stay warm they didn't have electricity they didn't have engines they they made boats out of trees and they use the wind to drift across the ocean while staring at the stars for the fucking a gigantic harp looking thing but it was that thing is Sextant yeah that things that you can make it across the ocean and a lot of people died of scurvy along the way like fuck man that's crazy that long ago that's so God damn Dan Carlin's Hardcore History one of the best podcast ever to be I don't know if you're not so good thing on the Mongols called the wrath of the khans and would freak me out is not just how

<timemark seconds="4716" />

crazy that world was back then and what unbelievable damage and destruction the Mongols created and now they just conquered Empires just moved across the world killed millions and millions of people who was a really fucked-up was I think Google this make sure I'm not wrong I think that was only like 1200 BC I don't think that was that long ago right to resend me that that's really reason I think Genghis Khan died in the 1200 if I remember correctly that's ABC I actually meant a dick I said BC I really did mean 8. I'm a little stoned from Star would still be still be pretty fucking recent but 1280 that's what I meant to say rice just not that long ago

<timemark seconds="4776" />

wish other way

<timemark seconds="4780" />

792 792 years ago a guy killed 50 million people during his lifetime with his actions right they change the carbon footprint of the world I mean did they say what's a sigmoid so then you're saying it was alright I was right kind of stuff gets more surprising that we're doing that then it is that people are running around killing you write each other maybe crazier than anything you know if you and Carla has some great stuff on that too in the history of World War 1 and World War II documentary on that you watching those people move around special that one that you showed me Jamie that's been digitally remastered when you see it in color is that is it Ken Burns into that yeah I think so they did some footage for World War I and you get to watch these people

<timemark seconds="4840" />

move around looking real time do years later involved in another crazy ass War yeah so I can we figure it out dude I don't know I think I think you used to be the only way the people got by I think I think from going from small groups of people which are like in the small groups of people they would have interpersonal conflicts they would have a fight with members in the tribe but they would sort it out and they would probably be some sort of rule that they would all try to live by but then he would get invaded by people that didn't have anything and we're looking for your stuff and it came over the top of the hill in the killed and they raped and the Beast old women and they just did that for a long-ass time man they did that for a long-ass time for the history of the steps like

<timemark seconds="4900" />

Dan Carlin Maps out in the Wrath of Khan thing makes you Jesus Chris imagine being born arrows flying around people lighting people on fire in launching them onto rules with catapults right this is the footage for the World War 1 you look at a digitally remastered alien documentary of Jackson that's the craziest thing when you look at history and you think they will that was then it's like no they're just us just happened to beat there really no different than you and me dude we haven't been here this long we haven't been here this long

<timemark seconds="4940" />

this is the thing like people that look like this the wearing like uniforms and did you know have like decent stuff nice Wheels to the wagons when I can. That's real reason man now I know Teresa as fuck and it's been a bunch of different ways that people have done it you know what even if you'd go back to like the Egyptian so it isn't the act of like like that guy with his house on fire we know that is a just instinctually we know and have known during even all of this history we've known that that is evil but you know what I mean like it's insanely selfish in that it's not like we went from having to like each other and that we're trying to get our act together I mean there is a we all know that that is such a evil evil thing I think it exists I think we have to fight it well it's it is evil but it's ego that's causing that right that guy didn't want to go to jail do you want to shoot himself

<timemark seconds="5001" />

you didn't want to kill himself and didn't want to go to jail so he decided he was going to kill a bunch of people to make up a story he had a plot in his plows to save himself that's when people get trapped in the situation where they're allowed to make decisions and they're allowed to you know if not allowed to but if they choose to make decisions and those decisions are horrific and then I have to somehow or another justify those decisions cuz they never look at their own behavior there was Judge other people this is a pattern of people fall into if there was looking for other people to always be wrong right never grow and so like a guy like that if he was so psychotic that he could kill somebody and then he has his decision to make this decision is to kill the wife and the kids still like he's just like always got to be right and I'm saying he's always he's got it he's trying to cover his tracks you trying to lie always like this is the type type of person I could do something like that again I've been triggered by the murderer

<timemark seconds="5060" />

so just a chemical flipping his brain that says now I can kill people like he hasn't done it this whole life and you just go into the Subway and get a sandwich with all the stuff on it and just like watching the Monday Night Football and then the next week is like something flips in his brain is like no now I can kill I don't think it's that I think all that I know and love I think in a fit of rage in a fit of rage you do something horrific and then I think he's one of those people that tries to justify his actions so it just 10 tries to figure out a way where he can justify it but they're they're going to be in hell anyway cuz the guy's dead they probably like we said before this is an Italian dude like us so we don't know if he's medicated do we

<timemark seconds="5120" />

I mean he could have been on something which you know makes people do horrific things you think you believe in karma

<timemark seconds="5128" />

I think for sure that when you put energy out there it affects things around you in terms of the way people interact with you and that in turn affects the way they will interact with other people as well and I think there's like there's there's a certain amount is an energy you put out its you can call it that but that makes it sound like you got a crystal in your pocket right not really energies real it's like energy is a real thing there's a real right if I was If I Was A Murder of her and came and sat in here there be a different vibe than what you're feeling from me yeah for sure you know what I mean yeah for sure a chronic masturbator well it's also people that are off and then struggling with the fact that they've done something awful energy to that yeah like a constantly being on edge energy yeah every crime and punishment that still CF I never read that you should read it it's so he kills

<timemark seconds="5188" />

this is Piggy's carrying the it's the Gilroy description of the guild just carrying that thing now that guy's going to admit and energy but you don't think it's karma just for like you do something bad will happen I think I genuinely believe in this is no crystals in my pocket I genuinely believe that if you do something that you know to be awful that that has an equal effect coming back at you like whatever bad that you put out in terms of like doing something evil to a person than the way you feel personally like about yourself you will take an equal blow

<timemark seconds="5230" />

I really believe that it was that blow come from I think comes from your own introspective thinking I think yourself then you realize you said something rude don't you know I'm so tired it's hard to turn that around yeah you know yeah she might hate yourself more than they even get mad at you so, it's really you dealing with the energy it's not the universe saying now something bad's going to happen to you you're kind of creating it with your own actions and your own stuff I think it's real dangerous when we pretend that we have any sort of real understanding of the patterns of all the events that take place in the world so when you start to say like someone something happen if someone because of karma that's okay at the problem was saying that is what about babies

<timemark seconds="5290" />

what about babies with leukemia were they bad babies what happened why do they get cancer why they die young why did they die in car accidents why did they that doesn't make any sense they did never done anything bad there babe but that's where you could say that you know that shit happens to us all but can you create more bad ship that you're creating more bad shit but feeling bad about yourself because you've done bad shit and so you create more of this negative energy that you carry around with you I think that's entirely possible to but I think that we also have this weird need to Define things you know that I think that we're looking to this thing that we're calling Karma and we're saying that this is like this this definite correlation between action and reaction in between the good you put out there and they could that comes back my take is that I think there's definitely something going on but I don't think you should Define it yet cuz I don't think we really know any

<timemark seconds="5350" />

make it soon as we box it up and and say it's this thing in this is the the absolute reaction that the world has when you put good out there good comes back all the time folks died I think we're I think there's I think there is an energy and you know we know it from the work that we do when you stand on stage in that room that transparence between you and the people that are out there and you're playing with it and it's a real thing to very real thing it's like hypnosis right yeah yeah it is and and then they can reverse hip hypnotize you they can bring this other energy the other way so that there is this energy of all of us out there and running around it's it's not that far to think then there couldn't be good energy and there's bad energy and there is and is that ultimately

<timemark seconds="5404" />

good and evil maybe it is all generator from human beings maybe if you educated everyone and they could all be kind and try and come in at that way we could actually feel that there was more good with that just more good coming from people I don't know well if you want to get really Spacey with this really Spacey the holidays you go okay what what what exactly are people doing that's what you do you know what are people doing what are they doing look at us from an outside perspective like pretend you're not a person or are you looking at all the people like what are they doing they're moving really hard time doing things they don't want to do and they're buying stuff bustling around so because all this money at stuff the stuff keeps getting better so every other stuff keeps getting more complex and more capable and more high-tech and More Space Age this is bananas matter going to watch I can call me but I Fucking Dick Tracy man people keep going on and on and on and on with this stuff

<timemark seconds="5464" />

this is we need some sort of energy behind this Innovation and lot of the energies conflict conflict and resolution conflict and resolution conflict in victory victory and defeat and it fit defeat makes you work harder and and is all these like interacting forces and I constantly moving together I'm with you ended this a lot of it is expressed the success of this little game is Express in material possessions the success in his game is Express in Hamptons mansions and private Jackson Bentley's and Pam I'm winning this fucking crazy game of stop and there's a lot of value in winning the crazy GameStop so we let these people acquire all this stuff and you got all these diamonds and fucking fireworks this is this is forcing more stuff to be made better and more Innovation which will eventually this is where it gets space used to bomb waiting for this

<timemark seconds="5524" />

this going to be what people become people are going to become some sort of symbiotic organism with something it's tied into electronics and that this is happening now that's happening slowly and we're making it with stop and if we keep making stuff it's eventually going to get to a part the what the thing you would like to do more than anything is happening enhancer experience on earth right right I want to be able to take pictures yes yes I want to be able to email people yes yes yeah but I also wanted I wanted to make my experience on Earth better then we're going to have to integrate with your circuitry Tom Papa and then live forever

<timemark seconds="5558" />

maybe maybe that's what the organisms are trying to do their chores get rid of the monkey that wants to start the Wars all the time right this is Goofy a system evil

<timemark seconds="5573" />

when it's only something to be a great science fiction movie but this is the future and we could probably already made it but if only some people when I'm bored with the new Enlightenment that you get from these like headsets and I remember the dude from Star Trek the black guy from Sesame Street. Yeah we all have those things on there was only like 10 of them into it and those things completely cure you of that have any evil and just moving along I think that

<timemark seconds="5613" />

maybe I don't know I mean there is maybe there is no purpose to as being here but that's a really cool cool air filter on top of a muscle car and put it in your Toyota Corolla old ones man when they fucking unscrew the Chrome hubcap and people don't remember man these people today don't remember gas smells like you can fix your own car you could open it up and with a screwdriver and a high school education fix your automobile I was never smart enough or knowledgable enough to fix my own car but I can do little things I can change my oil do a lot of things with old car exactly

<timemark seconds="5673" />

did the break out the Bold move right and wrong I was poor do I put it up on a jackhammer and a cinder block that held it underneath and put them in I probably have to get it fixed after that but yeah you could fix stuff there was like a time when you could actually and you felt good but but yeah if you had to choose between one of those fucking rickety ship boxes that's like a rhinoceros on roller skates

<timemark seconds="5711" />

versus your Tesla no steering no airbags hydroplane at the drop of a hat spinning around me just slide all over the place it was so easy to slide your car back done with your friends just getting out that's the big deal if you like a Tesla or anything if I fucking Camry okay that Camry handles better than a 69 Camaro how do I get to see what the death rates are better of the roads now with like new cars that's got to be

<timemark seconds="5767" />

it's probably much better I mean people are there much safer I've never done it before but they're also driving much faster to fatal shooting was drilling glass Sparks and fumes fumes were everywhere that you could drive you be getting high from the feeling was working for a fireplace company in the summer in New Jersey and I was in a truck or in this truck in traffic on the New Jersey Turnpike right by Newark Airport and just the fumes from everything from the city from a glorious day it was just orange in the humidity of New Jersey I was like if I get cancer this is going to be the day that it makes people crazy it's like it's breathing that just all day so disgusting pull up a video of the sound of the exhaust of a 1969 Camaro

<timemark seconds="5827" />

some things are selling gas is a good smells like chest that man if that sound is a sound how about this one even better 1960 Chevelle 1970 Chevelle SS

<timemark seconds="5842" />

yeah I just fuck yourself rest of the world that shit that's America motherfucker there's nothing illegal about that sound that is a America

<timemark seconds="5860" />

driving one of those motherfuckers around was very cool I mean American Muscle Cars is preposterous as they are they represent a lot of ways what's great about America access under the hood that's all it is a explosion box look at this time is it

<timemark seconds="5894" />

there it is again 69 put it at that is fucking insanely beautiful good Lord but you know what

<timemark seconds="5902" />

oh my God this is this guy

<timemark seconds="5907" />

dude this is gloriousness you seen heaven on Earth right here 1969 Chevelle look how pretty that car is man across the street from me and I'm looking at with my coffee out of my window and he comes pull it out with that has Saturday morning you know what I'm saying what this guy's an asshole do you hear her be with his new car through a mid-life crisis you say that but I guarantee you if you was next door and you just walked over and looked at it it would catch you in it spell it would have to be so loud yeah but if she would you like to go out 1969 huh you'll start walking around is pretty badass it's beautiful like that today cuz it's not even remotely aerodynamic

<timemark seconds="5967" />

an earring that is the one part of the American Experience recklessness element of balls to the wall let's see what happens let's discover and you could get good things out of it right but imagine this imagine something that's far inferior to the modern alternative but makes you feel and where the modern alternative isn't capable of feel like if you see a 1969 like done up Mustang GT what was like the big one that year was it a Mach 1 what the fuck was the 1970 was it a boss that's what it was 69 was like a boss and then earlier than that that they made those Eleanor cars for that Sean in 60 seconds I think those are 1967 if you looked at one of those next to a 2018 Mustang to 2018 Mustangs look fucking great they look great that's it right

<timemark seconds="6027" />

Tamaqua yeah that's it that's right dude there's a company that's making these now too. They're called classic Recreations and they're making these like brand new versions of that car they take they take 1969 Mustangs and they rebuild them but they give him like real break so they stopped good modern suspension of right and make it so you could drive it around that's what I'm interested in that makes sense to me Mustang badass tires look like when you look at that how how beautiful is that it doesn't look like anything that you can buy that's modern there they just nailed it whatever the fuck they did they nailed all these years later like God damn

<timemark seconds="6086" />

lunkhead from New Jersey that doesn't do that for you it does but I don't know I don't know young people would like that I don't know they're like to start arresting them if they don't like that if young boys don't look back and say good God that's incredible they don't do that then they should probably go to jail somewhere that is pretty hot that's incredibly good-looking but it's no no airbag need to do more last just to see your face it's probably a little bit of that cold yeah my buddy but if you saw something like that

<timemark seconds="6146" />

little orange thing in the middle that looks closer to what I find a 76 Toyota Corolla call that up call up a 1976 Toyota Corolla with with the racing stripes along the side look at that bad boy look at that was it I had a 1984 Honda Accord pull up shut up Jamie

<timemark seconds="6169" />

84 Honda Accord with stuttering spark plug that's a 79 you need the 76

<timemark seconds="6176" />

those are cool little cars though that's what I could fix that car I though that's what I was doing the brakes on one of those forever exactly that they are amazing how reliable Hondas are just go forever 7 that crummy car is a good thing but so you think your point of view of the one of these people doing here so they're building I like where you're going maybe making stuff for what what because everything's electronically based and the stinkers or is it being steered by something or we just finding our way in the dark and this is what's coming out or is there some plan

<timemark seconds="6236" />

hard to know if there was a plan yeah I get I get why some would be suspicious if there would be but if you just see the whole nature right with the starting off of the tribal behavioral invasions of the others in the wars of taking place or non stop right you get this hyper competitive team oriented things broken in two countries why I think that with that in this like constant competition in this constant in an inside your country is constant competition economically and everybody is striving to achieve and do better and get crazier and bigger and that this is all leading us just continuing to buy stuff like everybody that is involved in this is buying the newest iPhones the newest MacBook the newest best and newest Xbox fucking how many Xboxes have there been down Sick for

<timemark seconds="6289" />

for ya better shit do you want VR we want to be hyper realistic VR I want to be out with no gear I want to be able to give me a pill and that pill release is a bunch of Nanobots that go through my circulatory system and find my my brain and Juice It Up with some artificial memory that's what I like Buckshot sounds like Buckshot like little babies coming out your poop this is mean beings always try to find safety right that's what they want more than anything they don't want to get killed they want to they want to be safe and exist eat whatever but they just want to be there they want that safety so maybe our safety is going to come when you're out of the woods were out of the wild where out of the 20th century and we're just these

<timemark seconds="6342" />

insular things that never have to go out and about and live forever and just be good maybe that's what all the push-up Technologies is aiming towards write protect ourselves of these little cocoons and and be

<timemark seconds="6360" />

yeah I mean if the ultimate threats always violence in war when does that's the ultimate threat to the organism organism to commit violence and war against each other doors and Gates and stuff to keep those things at Bay yeah but it's the most fascinating things that people are dressed like what would what would cause a person to snap there's no real concrete

<timemark seconds="6386" />

no concrete answer what do you think is the difference between

<timemark seconds="6393" />

and I'm asking is honestly killing when you're hunting and killing a human being would be a giant different so I don't like the way you felt it though I don't know I've never killed a human being but I would I would imagine that it would be I mean it would have to be some horrific situation where you're you're battling for your life and I'm which people do the dentist does happen right you know we were all aware of it the worst possible scenario we would all like to think that everybody that we meet

<timemark seconds="6427" />

that's of sound mind should be our brothers and sisters when we should all get along whether you agree or disagree about certain political issues or certain social issues like we still talk through that as a community but like always hold at the top that we're all in this together and if I think that's possible I think that's possible and I think we could still satisfy this fucked-up desire that we have to constantly compete we can temper that with I would I think is the most important thing is finding something that you're passionate at because I think you and I are really really lucky that we found stand up and threw stand out we found this thing that we're past it at and we have a good time we have fun some people don't have that so I can fight if you were offered a job as a stockbroker and do this is a guaranteed job you were guaranteed contract for the next 20 years ago to make five times as much as make doing stand-up he can't do stand up anymore

<timemark seconds="6483" />

you never take that even though you're a guy does well you're not a business person you're not following your passion right and it's allowed you to live a nice life but that doesn't it's not the same as a lot of people what a lot of people are doing is just chasing the money so the the passion doesn't exist and they can manufacture that passion when it comes to like some desire to see their their team kick ass because their company's number one but it's not the same as a guy like David choe who's like a professional artist who's making he's he just follows his passion is a different kind of achievement is a feeling that he has the way he interfaces with what he does for a living that's different than what a lot of people do so I would imagine that artist would probably be less inclined to go crazy and spend all their money

<timemark seconds="6543" />

can stop and buy things that make them look better or make them feel better about the fact they work so cuz they're not trying to fill a hole that right right you have a job for a company that you don't really give a fuck about you don't really give a fuck about styrofoam coolers and you know you really don't give a fuck about fucking those rubber bands that people buy when they have the Clauses does it your business to see if we can work this through Bob were talking about a thousand bucks just be doing something else yeah you don't you you're insanely fortunately you don't have that in your life but I think I don't think those people look a lot of people have jobs as they're not into but the reason we're lucky is that our job is our passion a lot of people have the job that they're maybe not into but they love this other stuff that they do they loves being with her family and

<timemark seconds="6603" />

teaching soccer they love skiing or whatever like their passion is something else like we're lucky that our passion is our work like to get those things that is a very very unique thing the most insanely lucky thing and it never know me but I think that for people that are like hyper-competitive that don't find the things they really love then it really for many of them becomes about pursuing the best stuff yeah and this is what fuels so many people for like these status symbols and I give you have an iPhone 8 with it if a kid sees you with an iPhone 8 and they got an iPhone 10 weird

<timemark seconds="6645" />

actually baby iPhone 8 has a fucking Chiller camera iPhone 8 you know it's like the batteries pretty similar to people very important they have the latest stuff like you can't be walking around like David tell the other day with the iPhone to there's nothing about it tell what is a searching for status he knows what's healthy Foreman what's not so other than the cigarettes by SIA cigarettes and coffee who saying this is vice he's a he's a poet amongst us like he's a really good guy

<timemark seconds="6705" />

yeah so kind just being around in his orbit I love him your stomach during the shark I love I love the two of them together yeah I know it's really funny I never said we were all young and New York I know right never would have saw that those two yeah right doing it I don't know what not for any real reason why I never saw any of us doing something like that yeah you doing live shows together so it's a great idea some of those shows you see those pictures for The Comedy Cellar in the morning like Dave Chappelle's on stage with Chris Rock and talking around like 3 guys I like watching him all through the years like he was always surprised when someone's father died or something have a towel as always

<timemark seconds="6757" />

front and center like helping out giving people money like there's a guy who was like, really appreciate like if your fan of the art form with David's house really someone to appreciate it cuz he's always creative it so it's like it's never do she is always fine skanks For The Memories as one of my all-time favorite TV that is so funny as a hilarious CD man I think he did that in Denver Wendy's put out very cool yeah he's so good yeah I mean to answer what you're saying yeah your face here it's photo I think that was when he was doing

<timemark seconds="6817" />

yeah that was some partying days yeah he said he's just such a smart guy like he just decided one point hey this is fucking me up no more drinking no more no more show me do this thing it's attracting negativity to my shows and setting me up as a guy it's going to drink himself into Oblivion for the cord for the party guy your life of the party guy needs hard babe this it burnt down yeah what's his end game at least he's doing it with her and Ron White I'll tell you he's riding that fucking boat ride in the rock is he doesn't give a fuck company chairs because I don't care, but happy holidays my friend I said it might rain under my tree

<timemark seconds="6871" />

what is a numeral Juan Tequila company I just said I set my train up under my tree and you still show goes on tequila did you have photos or videos of the Train on your trade I am I think I didn't put nothing on the Instagram probably wouldn't be real if it wasn't 16 and 13 and they were at school and I'm setting up the village under the tree and the train tracks and all the people like shopping at the village and I was like doing it on my own because they don't have time to really do it and I was like this is how people become the guy in the neighborhood is like bring your children around to look at my chain said because your family leaves are there any children

<timemark seconds="6920" />

I could totally see myself doing that at some point totally they go wall Close Encounters of the Third Kind make that giant one in the middle of the living room in the middle of Israel house yet Richard Dreyfuss to course Jesus Christ Richard Wright out on a great movie he's been great and so many things I was like always the unassuming guy draws me who is the song artist Steven Spielberg's Alter Ego really be so good

<timemark seconds="6979" />

movie this was cuz I wanted to believe so bad oh yeah I so wanted to believe they got me got me and we change our galaxy it did but you didn't hear about that one the one that looks like a joint or a big piece of poo that's just a weird rock I think now they said that some like legit people said that it change speed and went in different directions NJ people who get people scientist said that it was it could be something could be

<timemark seconds="7021" />

what is Neil Degrassi say about it it's not talking right now

<timemark seconds="7026" />

hey you guys in a little bit of a kerfuffle kerfuffle what's his gym

<timemark seconds="7032" />

Harvard scientists say aliens may explain bizarre Interstellar object yeah I saw that and then I saw someone refuting that they would scientist or something on Joe it's real well if I was going to mask my spaceship to fly through the Galaxy I would definitely make it look like a big rock yeah right why wouldn't you driving through space Maybe maybe they were like look if we just make this thing drive by them and don't change speed still no have no idea to stay right there beside too we miss them okay I could call Google next song. Someone just hit the gas I'm tired I want to fucking taking too long but she just decides but you got it Dave you're not supposed to just take off 65 you fuck

<timemark seconds="7084" />

start throwing this weed out the window why would it be so hard to believe a space Rock traveling through space that would be the move right I mean if they are so Advanced they can travel through galaxies they can make this shit look like anything you wanted to yeah I would need all it up

<timemark seconds="7099" />

radiation pressure rating for would be well there's no air in space right so it wouldn't be aerodynamics what would it be momentum no go down a little bit take it answers your question if radiation pressure is the accelerating Force then, represents a new class of thin Interstellar material it has a different thing that using for energy

<timemark seconds="7126" />

but as to what may have produced as previously unseen material it could have emerged naturally from the debris of the planet forming disc in a distant solar system going through yet an unknown process it got a whole nother way to mix we went from Toyota Corollas to this thing and like a rock rock hat is not smooth but it doesn't necessarily need is where I'm stupid if this is one of one of many places where I'm stupid but it doesn't necessarily need to be aerodynamic right cuz it's not going through are in space right exactly so I'm not wrong there if you could it could actually look like a rock but the only issue would be getting it into space right the aerodynamics assuming that you shooting it from a planet with an atmosphere gravity not be talked about this way to stupid Earth into space right yeah what if you had it in case stand

<timemark seconds="7186" />

is outer area sort of like the space shuttle is then once you get to a place you could jettison the outside of it just like they did get rid of those booster are that's why life is falling down people while they're Fishin great but then they could do that they can release the shell and then they would just have the Rock and The Rock would move through space and it didn't matter what shape it was cuz it's in the vacuum of space just get it up into orbit orbit like the space station go and build it in pieces and then launched it in that Commander Chris Hadfield gentleman was on the podcast and he was talking about some kind of magnet that they have that collects subatomic particles out there in the galaxy and then we only know 5% of what the universe is made out of

<timemark seconds="7246" />

the guys scientist space real legit apps not coming back from 6 months and space or whatever the fuck he was there for and telling us this really wow we all talked about that you can hang with those guys for a little while and then you're like I don't understand what's happening now it's also the means amazing what we do know amazing got to space and have them fly around the ISS or yeah I mean we'll talk about what you were saying about why are we here and what are we doing like we haven't developed yet something that we can go the speed of light we haven't but if we do then the whole universe is open to us maybe that's what it is maybe the struggle of developing all the stuff is to get to a scientific level where we can really go I don't think they think the speed of light is even good enough really yeah I take damn it I think that like if you wanted to have options available so what

<timemark seconds="7306" />

Planet you're going to colonize you going to have to who knows what did you and it's like hey it's 74° Hawkeyes guys it's all oxygen and nitrogen come on out here come on out here but it's only been like that for 10 years and then it's cycle it's really fucked up but yeah I already years from now it's going to be an ice age and then are all the people there and they're going to freeze to death is give me no food at all and that plan doesn't give a fuck I don't even know if we can predict here's my question can I accurately predict the atmosphere in the conditions in like with a temperature would be if a planet is from a sun do they have a calculation where they say oh this sun is this amount of big and its planets this far away so it's definitely going to stay with a certain temperature range of the entire time to the plant do they know that like within like a death range I don't deserve

<timemark seconds="7365" />

bro yeah you get 200 for that's a wrap that you're done yeah so like a hundred make it a hundred forty everyone's Dad I just don't think we're going to make it anywhere not figuring it out cuz we're saying this amount of big helping maybe that is it maybe it's all this thinking you know you talked a lot about all the robots in the things that are moving us forward but why but why but why and I had the Cocoon Theory before but maybe that's not it maybe it's so we can really go yeah I've had the Cocoon theory for quite a while where I think that we are like some sort of an electronic caterpillar that's building some Cocoon House in a butterfly's going to merge because when right when I said Collective like we'll all be part of this in the computers in the AI in our

<timemark seconds="7425" />

integration with them that eventually she's going to get smarter and crazier and weirder yeah I mean it's only a matter of time before they make something that resembles a person

<timemark seconds="7436" />

sounds to sciencealert know it sounds that it would just be for us to stay here on her well universe is so vast I think it's more likely

<timemark seconds="7451" />

that were going to go out of this that's a very good idea I just assumed since it's kind of amazing ever been to Utah to see if you could look at the stars or look at the design beautiful the beautiful two suns in sky in a day like today lovely to go outside this Cloud around just gives you just write on a sun.star contrast the best lovely how could you say this is sewer because it was so many parts of it disgusting not not not so many parts because we still have

<timemark seconds="7490" />

Miss evil this other stuff that's still filled with murder not right here right here it's only it's in certain spots so this is the other thing that we tend to do because we have 7 billion people on the planet and cameras on all of them changing the stories you like younger catching stories from unimaginable number few minutes yeah right and so even if we're looking at just our country this is so many people just don't like so many people is 20 million people and see what's really amazing it's really amazing is not just how far human beings have come over the last you know hundred 200 300 years but what's really amazing is if you just look at the actual numbers of times that people interact with each other how few of them are violent especially in a place like America in 2018 I think about that on the freeway I'll just so many people may just right and they're all

<timemark seconds="7550" />

how much acting in an orderly fashion to preserve themselves and others every now and then you have someone that's just crazy and just violate all the rules as we've been in traffic driving a hundred 50 miles an hour in a residential Community only the same way those things exist since you like a biological system right and get these little diseases little bugs it's little things that are off and you know and then you have an immune system and it battles the bugs chimpanzees herb and there's like everyone's getting along trying to do the things your struggles but then there's a real mutation like there's someone that there's one that kills the rest of them and won't be part of the thing you know that's what we have any of these kind of like

<timemark seconds="7600" />

Renegade mutations run by evil what's interesting is done in large groups right and all of us together like the way we interact with each other is generally non-violent whoever these large groups will decide by whatever you know whoever's in charge to attack other large groups

<timemark seconds="7624" />

and this is where the big death comes from right this is where the the real toll comes from in war right so but if you looked at the actual communities of people from one side of the other like the groups to themselves together how much are they really in conflict with those other people probably not nearly as much as people that are in charge would want them to be which right that it's almost like the mutation is in charge right because he's right you take two groups that are at War you put them together they're just hanging out drinking beer together we're all the same age there's probably have a great time together Cedars of a mutation that's when things get hairy weather is the Hitler leader or you know who ever is the one that's invading places at talking people into invading places yeah that's some slippery justification yeah that's where the world gets very strange and and I think it's interesting that those people in those groups in all come

<timemark seconds="7684" />

from all over the world are all over the country list all these different places that are brought together right but look how you were of those kind of conflicts now than ever before I put you and I and I think a lot of other people would like it to be zero amount right yeah but I don't know if that's ever going to happen man that's a weird thing to say because you would do would like everybody to be in a good place in the world but you'll almost wonder if like many things as like this push of good things happening in bad things positive and negative in that there's a battle between the two of them is what creates all this moment and all this movement that's the good and evil we're back to the good and evil so maybe we should go back to church look weird stuff in there more than evil people well the problem is with that church in particular there still shielding the people have done Terrible Things yeah yeah there's just no denying that if there's if you look at the fax if you look at everything that's coming

<timemark seconds="7744" />

there's no denying that she's super unfortunate cuz I think the vast majority of the people that are involved in the religion that aren't the people that are pedophiles I think they're very good people that probably think about it the same way maybe your daughter would like to think about it then it's someplace where people can get together and they exchange affection and camaraderie and end of this acceptance of something higher than them that holds them to certain standard wants to be good people and then that's good for everybody good for everybody but it wasn't such a sad sad thing Google this because I've said this many times and have never bothered looking it up the reason why we need another bottle. If you want to get fucked up

<timemark seconds="7791" />

okay the holidays the holidays what we just talked about Good and Evil and the priests and the roommate thing wrong musical get the video with it

<timemark seconds="7808" />

oh that's it thank you thought I was gone forever I voted the reason why they forced priest to be celibate because what I had heard was it and this is not no scholarly work of my own I don't remember even reading the article I think somebody told it to me that priests were banging too many checks Bravo you might have said it that way Christmas bag too many chicks man they made a mess out of it which I think I don't think that was it what do you think it is I think that when priest priest on property and if they were married and he died she would keep the property if there was no woman involved and he own the property and he couldn't be with a woman and he swore that he was just with Jesus when he died the property went to the church

<timemark seconds="7862" />

yeah yeah that's you too which is not much I mean that's crazy it's wow that whole other part of Catholicism as the other thing that bugs me all the time when you go to the Vatican wow this is beautiful but what were they get all this art where they get all these bills I mean the pillaging of millions of dollars for the shit out stolen from a time when people starving in the streets

<timemark seconds="7889" />

this is how powerful religion is this is how powerful this poll is to search for good in to be a part of something is that in light of those things that you see the wealth it's like going into like a pirate ship and seeing all the shit that they got and then knowing what they do is with these children both those things are

<timemark seconds="7909" />

you should just say I'm not going to be part of this at all but the the the other part of it is so strong that you actually will kind of say well yeah but I'm still going to go to mass on Sunday I think you know what that means is you think that even if a priest is bad that the religion is still good you know you tried him and beans that are flawed man Grandma's man Grandma's you know her name is Josephine be kept calling to Geraldine nobody was saying all these great things about any brought another bottle of wine on Mike Savage Savage Jamie Jamie but I think you know when you put them in that position where you can't have a companion like you're not allowed to

<timemark seconds="7969" />

have fun love ya have a wife or husband or whatever you can you can't have that you're not allowable things to do in nature who's the kid that I went to HighSchool with that became a priest yeah well News Gay oh yeah like it was it was like a thing you know like others why is going to be a priest we get it right well that's what a lot of people say it's like that the church the other side of the church doesn't create pedophiles with the institution of tracks them because they know they'll be safe there well it's it's possible but it's also possible that so many of them that are active in the church I don't know what this guy's story was I barely knew him yeah but that he could have been molested mean this not me some small number of kids that were molested so very large not large and you would never believe who the fuck understands what that would be like to be a young boy to have that happen to you and then get groomed and indoctrinated into being a part of this thing that does that to other young boys in the future your hole real

<timemark seconds="8029" />

which has to be with some of them are and they're all doing this under the blanket of this thing called The Church then when the church finds out about at the church moves people to all these different various places and they they get these new victims me over and over and over again that they were saying about Benedict about the one who he doubt he was always people yeah he's a part of that so bad so bad and it's such a shame Mary Catholic priest in the US already here's how whatever's on your side about 200 as of 1980 the adoption of a rule change that allowed

<timemark seconds="8079" />

it doesn't say this is a Eastern only because I would have 10

<timemark seconds="8084" />

yeah but why is he Eastern Catholic like East Coast Meadows West Coast by Mexicans not by the bush it Brooklyn married in the house

<timemark seconds="8102" />

huh hundred and twenty Catholic priests married in the United States wow by Pope John Paul II in 1980 which offer to path for married Episcopal priest to continue their Ministry after converting to Catholicism oh so you have to be a priest already at the Pisgah pelean and that you're allowed to have a wife and kids if you're pissed Coppelia for sure so let me look at me look at that right there like chat Catholicism is the only one that doesn't allow them to have sex right is the only one with the little kid fucking I mean come on just cut the shit and he was talking about there was one thing from the gospel that was talking about being married being with a woman and then he finishes her answer to happy holidays

<timemark seconds="8162" />

at the reading then he goes into a sermon all about being with a woman and this is a man that doesn't come close to that is a man that has no experience but I would be so much better for the church if he was a married man with children and then he could really talk about being in a family like who are you you know nothing about what we are dealing with on a daily basis I never went to the Catholic church when I was an adult but I would it would be curious to be there to be like a husband and wife sitting there in this fucking Church listen to this dude who is supposed to be celibate drone on about how you should live your life what kind of relationship you should have looked bitch your dress like a fucking Genie who is he doing what's that thing around your shoulders for why you dress like that like that like if you didn't if he just stood up there and had to be held accountable

<timemark seconds="8222" />

the volume of his words were all he had like if you just made all priests and I mean all priests across all religions if they all had to stand on a flat regular stage with nothing behind them and they had a dress like a like a regular person like you were dressing right now no pointy hat no pointy hat no no fucking giant insane artwork behind you. You've been around silica when you go in there I mean you almost can't believe that your eyes are working correct right exactly you almost like this can't be something that someone actually made yeah this is insane with no machines just their hands and thousands of people like that. That if you're in that thing you're going to be so humbled and so they're going to get away with a lot more shit then if you were in some weird conference room and

<timemark seconds="8282" />

parking at the Holiday Inn little little bullshit ask up the coffee guy from Cops a handle on it the paper handle the folds out and you dress and Joseph A bank cuz they have to be a certain size to have a handle it's the ones that it did a little white ones little white styrofoam ones with your bullshit yeah but they were putting the plastic to buy your fucking connection to go in that place right sell it you not did not just going to buy it I would like to dress like a wizard of a golden Podium with a giant huge sculpture of Jesus nailed to a cross behind you and his organ music playing you know I mean huge that's what's up that's that's your act it's going to look at that the same way they made advertising Boozled

<timemark seconds="8343" />

add

<timemark seconds="8345" />

but you know what the gal pretty that is though it's gorgeous so pretty when it be better if it was just Christmas Mass or some bunch of belly dancers up there and two people passed around joints found that place just a big ol cannabis-infused love in be better than this bullshit so we can get all those grown adults just passing out weed singing songs together what was it in in New York with the Limelight that was a church that turned into a club

<timemark seconds="8376" />

thousands of people in the church singing singing together with some people right that's a big crowd those people that are sitting there they are kind of hi there checking the watch right now and go when does baseball shit off of this guy droning on he's drunk Gladys he's fucking drunk I put you in the basket now they're coming out twice with the basket screw this guy me hear you what is the value of them having a place to go on that Sunday even though they hate it important to Limelight is a gym now yeah the Limelight was so the Limelight

<timemark seconds="8435" />

The Dance Club Fitness it was a church it was a market to it was a church so it was a rock Club so it doesn't last started selling your house Tom Papa it's that would inspire you to get your party rolling live in a church gym now do you have to work on that church all day wouldn't you had a job in my house I would definitely go to that gym all the time she's always like I like working out like at my studio but I like going to places to go to a place like there's a certain amount of juice you know you're at a new spot but true people around you that you don't know that you're out you're out and it's also as a comic I think social interaction is one of the least respected ingredients to are weird sort of stew

<timemark seconds="8495" />

fill the well with that with those experience yeah you got to talk to me yeah it's like reading or just being out in the world it's important it's just all like all those things I think like interacting with people just took God damn gigantic so important I do this I do a monologue each week on out in America on life from here which is the new Prairie Home Companion and I are you allowed to say that yeah but did anybody else call me now to decide to call yourself that what the new Prairie Home Companion it is so you're actually doing the thing when I first got hired it was Prairie home and then they changed it when Garrison Keillor got in trouble now called life from here he had a couple and I do a monologue each week old out in America about a year I figured you would know

<timemark seconds="8555" />

things considered only Terry Gross I follow all the shit you do I didn't know how you follow the should I do weird

<timemark seconds="8564" />

but my point is I do this model I called out in America and it's me it's me it's me glasses shining a light on all the good people in America right I do it every week on NPR like you own it

<timemark seconds="8578" />

but the reason I bring it up is not to plug it but to say it made me when I'm out on the road talk to people I would get in the car and throw my my headphones on I wouldn't talk to people on flights I didn't talk to the person and driving stay in my room do my shit is a comic your isolated and because I have to write this monologue each week I need inspiration I really want to shine a light on the good people out in the country I started talking to everyone I don't take my headphones out I talk to the driver I talk to the people next to me if they want to talk and it is talk about filling the well for your comedic you know toolbox it's the greatest thing in the world there's billions of people they all are unique they all have a story to tell it's foolish lisp as a comedian not to talk to me sweetheart they don't all have a story to tell some of them want to hear it

<timemark seconds="8638" />

boring ass fucking store everyone has a story god dammit you going to get a lot of stories going to be coming your way love you fine

<timemark seconds="8651" />

you talk to them about their family about their childhood about where they're growing grew up with there's there is a story there is a way to look at it you take the biggest fucking loser that ever existed on planet Earth if you discover now on Mars is the biggest store in human history

<timemark seconds="8671" />

did you find some underwear doggie Mass jerking off with a bathrobe on on Mars it would be like the most important thing that's ever happened like this can't be real Mass beating off in Venice but I'm still interested if you say yes or no there is currently a man with a donkey mask on wearing a bathrobe jerking off in Venice yeah you might might want to lean yes mean if they're bringing it to you I'd be super suspicious but that's your question

<timemark seconds="8725" />

my question my question is do you think that it ever happened but yes everything you can make up as a confident that someone has jerked off with a donkey mask on 100 wear like a hotel bathrobe especially when it's all about masks in Venice I'm 100% confident that you take historically right right right right now Venice Beach

<timemark seconds="8759" />

can I ask you a question sure

<timemark seconds="8764" />

back to weigh in the beginning of the podcast when I was talking about wine and how I'm trying to learn about it and stuff the one thing I don't know about wine is what I do drink it I never feel that drunk and we've had a bottle and a half now do I seem drunk pretty fucked up don't tell me anything you don't tell me

<timemark seconds="8785" />

<timemark seconds="8831" />

can I read you seem exactly the same as when we started I think you're projecting there was one point when after you smoked a lot you were going to eat that's why I didn't work and you can tell it was a bit of a body high I think there's benefit to it I don't think this like I don't think you should do everything all the time but I think his benefit I don't think you should exercise all the time, I'll tell you this when I was flying back from New York yesterday and knew we had this when I was on the flight I was thinking it would be so nice to bring a bottle of wine just chill with the guys and that would be so happy and now that we're in that moment is so happy me too so happy good place about Jamie's hips really taken time

<timemark seconds="8882" />

<timemark seconds="9316" />

to practitioner in me is like I don't like this moved this is I know where this leads woke up I woke up what are you 12 welcome to come to my sixteen-year-old so yeah kids today stop your problem is there's no real quantification there's no real there's no test you take the show that if your woke wreck right position you have the fucking show that you got to do mad the professors like you get through like yes congratulations Tom Papa you are a mathematician you have a PhD in mathematics SL radiator the paper I know how this stuff works but wokeness anybody can claim to be a master wokeness it's like Kung Fu without fighting

<timemark seconds="9376" />

it's very dangerous to find what's woke and what's Preposterous no one's to find what's what's just not racist and not sexist and not homophobic but open-minded and aware of the the the feelings in the misgivings of all sides all of us with no bias we jump in the snow is no real clear understanding of like what makes and constitutes someone being woke like yeah how many of those boxes do you have to check. Tom Papa had a woke Academy right and you took these peaceful trip

<timemark seconds="9424" />

<timemark seconds="9540" />

oh wow so the meme of the word woke wow look at that little image though it again that's so strange like a batch of that was contemporary you were like imagine hipsters all the sudden start wearing tail so their jackets

they just decided Next Level we have bow ties and those Tails would be surprising I'm doing what you guys don't do so I'm going to help what a weird look though that is so weird that's a looked at like okay so like the guy in the center so I got to sit on so totally the guy that left it like looks like he's dressed like he's that looks like me on the road yeah I mean but he looks like he's in a Quentin Tarantino movie or something or dog that is totally normal black singer expect suit tie Donald or I can go to any restaurant anywhere and no one would even bad and I to go hosur can help you boom next to him but those two guys on the ends like what in the fuck are they he's got a coat with Tails and those pants that are like flat across your crotch where it looks like you have no privates

<timemark seconds="9617" />

we look at it imagine you're dating a girl and your parents going to come over and you like you really going to love my dad he's an amazing guy he's real old-school dad comes over the dress like that would coattail like you're in that movie get out if they're going to funny shoes you should get out yeah I finally watch it during sober October fantastic like that but the daughter was going to lead you to something you have to run for your life but it is weird how I like that suit has lasted a long time well this is 1960 so I'm assuming that it was mocking the style of old so by the time 1960 rolls around the guys in the middle wear dress contemporary but the guys in the end it like making fun of people the way they used to dress yeah kind of in a y or at least that's what represents those people

<timemark seconds="9677" />

yeah they just defines their time that guy. Probably around the 1800s that's why it's got the pan and he's catching his head is that guy is putting out his slang so his slang is making way better go or what the fuck like a rat Jamie I sometimes get confused with pull up the Urban Dictionary and find out what the real word of the word means so let's pull up woke represent today

<timemark seconds="9714" />

welcome no disrespect no cultural appropriation intended the fact that it was invented asking the 16 round

<timemark seconds="9726" />

if you take it you woke me where knowledgeable about your community in the world with the willingness to access and critique systems of Oppression know that the end of its particles card exactly for sure if it really is a system for prescient but how do we decide what's a system of Oppression and what is Sensa give me Jordan Peterson weird human behavior that represents the way men and women interact with each other on a grand scale

<timemark seconds="9762" />

there are some legitimate systems of Oppression figure out which one it is yeah before but putting that in like that's what woke is like how do you how do you define what the systems of like where does it where's the line get drawn the line

<timemark seconds="9784" />

like why do women have certain jobs why do men have certain jobs and how much of that is because of influence how much of that is cuz of their choices how much of that is just cuz of natural proclivities towards certain things what are you talking about people that are coming after the hierarchy and if I'm coming up to the hierarchy who's to say that those people aren't part of the problem just like hammers just what do you say no but it's true it's like then this true that that woke definition was like how I'm with you being nice and kind and then at the end it's about attacking right but he's the crazy thing is the end part about attacking is work it's weird because

<timemark seconds="9833" />

Jordan Peterson is a guy who gets regular attacked yeah misrepresented like it especially in terms of like that he somehow another racist because some racist like him I've heard that argument it's crazy argument doesn't make any sense yeah he's not racist by any stretch of the imagination if he believes in individuals yeah yeah then I know her name but I would say I N Grind it up but it really is like his thing is it's like the power of the individual and responsibilities and doing your thing yes and he's he's understand this time of course he's under that he's also under celebration yeah he's been celebrated as well as attacking much more celebrated it seems under celebration what is under attack he it's nice to hear that Viewpoint articulated in such a clear concise way he's a genuine sweetheart of God I mean I think if people knew him I think in a part of the thing is some of his views or

<timemark seconds="9893" />

powerful polarizing to some folks that will who have a specific idea of how things are and what things should be and what the what represents transphobia what represents sexism you know these are all fascinating discussions as long as everybody's like just being rational and yeah and being honest about it but it's good you're all sides and you should hear me what he saying is you know in a lot of ways is like very true and very real and it's like right but the presentation of it in these times it's like he's very brave because he knows that anything he says there's going to be a shitstorm in response he's very brave in that respect but is also very brave in that he's done a tremendous amount of research on those different subjects he's talking about and when he talks about something from a scientific perspective is not talking about it because of the lines for this beliefs rat and he will in fact highlight things that don't align with his beliefs

<timemark seconds="9953" />

and show that he has a hole in someone's thinking he'll help heal pause in mid-sentence and goes well I guess I'm wrong then he's just he's not scared to take on this system of the way people think and behave and this system works both for a really Progressive open-minded people that support most of things that you and I are probably support and it also the system is also in place for people that have more stringent conservative Viewpoint have to look at everybody honestly if you wanted to bait weather someone's opinions are one thing or the other absolutely I'm with you 100% the problem is we start calling someone a racist racist because you think that racist like him or calling some of the sexiest because you think that sex is like him because he says says things that you don't agree with if you don't agree with them and you just dismiss them at this like as is real

<timemark seconds="10013" />

the shallow sexist opinion the problem is other people going to read what you're saying they're going to look into it and it's going to seem silly right as the guy has volumes and volumes and volumes that you could read and that he has books he has all these different lectures we discuss these things podcast we discuss these things in really complex and well-thought-out ways you can't you can't say his race and what's his what's unfortunate is that represents the stuff we should then our responsibility is to deal with the stuff deal with the idea is not what does it matter who he is how he talks what he has what you think and who cares what the problem is we call him 100 thank you take it whether you like it or not take it and then wrestle that idea and move it for 100% but we also have to be aware that's a real problem and calling someone a monster is not a monster right because it went real monsters come along you already use that word up that's this is like

<timemark seconds="10073" />

you have to be careful cuz there's real racist in the world is real bad people so calling someone a bad person just cuz you don't agree with them you fall into a very slippery ideological trap and run some people do it just to get attention I want to throw their hat into the ring they want their there they're their say they want they want to get it out they want to make an impact they want that love really want to be part of that I want to be part of discussion they might have very strong beliefs that they think or cracked but I I guarantee if you if that those strong believer that Jordan is racist you don't know him that well there's no way you could write as in there's no way you're really familiar with a lot of the things he says about race cuz he doesn't say anything racist she talks in terms of he always emphasizes individuals yeah it's not about that it's about it's about the person you responsible for you to hang you despite whatever comes at you cuz everything's always going to come at you

<timemark seconds="10133" />

Christmas fucking horrible but what it is is the saying that like we can all we can all figure out a better way to navigate this than the shity way that racist and bad people don't pass right

<timemark seconds="10146" />

you know it's kind of racist I was I wanted to put African Americans in my Christmas Village couldn't and you go online and try and look up African-American figurines for whatever

<timemark seconds="10161" />

it's not good they haven't their prisoners worker like there's not a lot of like just regular families just definitely a lot of white people let's let's guess this was us before we look it up together outraged about is it possible that you can buy ceramic slave

<timemark seconds="10193" />

yes you think so well through a store maybe not on the internet eBay for sure really you know how much stuff was put out into the culture of like Alfalfa kind of representations of kids and slave children and how about that like keepsakes at one point it like a shoe box of stuff and she just had a postcard from her friend it was too like blackheads eating watermelons and I was like Grandma what it what the hell is this I was thinking of 15 just like I was just a joke but I only bring it up because that was circulated that was being pumped out all the time in the culture so there's definitely stuff you can get second hand on eBay

<timemark seconds="10251" />

Dirt Cheap a number long as there white slaves were good show me some Roman slaves that address like they were in that gladiator Flav's Gladiator movie in a fight

<timemark seconds="10264" />

okay so this is non not American so all those slaves are like that's isn't interesting like it can't be like it's got to be like I didn't do it and put them cuz none of my people made them people slaves fucked up bro

<timemark seconds="10280" />

right like you have to have a little Easter in ancient 100 b c o the person who buy they look like Henry Fonda accurate if they want like a house they look like Henry Fonda Kirk Douglas white hair white people you know I mean I'm sure and the sequences and then yeah you're good. Good call Sir you call an Alexa at home yeah let's listen to right now I know that bitch my friend told me like you really should just take that off when I talk she's like no they listen all the time

<timemark seconds="10340" />

<timemark seconds="10363" />

awesome painter shit Lego ripoff is got Lego hands I'd be mad if I bought that I thought I was a Lego it was really cool as you're a kid you're apparently you said I want Legos and your parents brought you that bitch this is not Legos it's easy to write that sentence that to make a new Lego he was a former slave in a historical context who was a former slave in a historical context that means he escaped I know it's a weird way to put it

<timemark seconds="10409" />

that's Sonic's Oculus racist toy instructions that's a new style racist toy instruction to Nana after the break and you made a fairly light notice how conservative they were they didn't make him super dark

<timemark seconds="10432" />

even they knew that was a kind of brownish Montoya you killed my father prepare to die like a nice tan Uncle to dark yes I'm saying the racist toy maker was like you know what we just got up we got to play it safe. This color that's it that's almost before you go to mass on Christmas no

<timemark seconds="10474" />

no mass at all I go to Willy Wonka's golden Chocolate Factory yeah we tables for very short amount of time that way would be hard because it was I was out by the time I was out of first grade but we moved from New Jersey to San Francisco and didn't find a Catholic school but I was just done I hated it I was in fear of those fucking crazy people your parents to take you to church or make you go they did a little bit I think the idea was back then that if you had kids she wanted kids go to Catholic school you know a lot of people that did that in that neighborhood when I'm a little just a normal thing you did and they were more strict and to dude one thing that was for sure though like

<timemark seconds="10534" />

my mom about it once she was like you know your grades were way better when you went in your Catholic school I was like yeah cuz I was fucking terrified to get them wrong they beat the shit out of want to live like that they never beat me really yeah they threatened to make me sit on nail we going to have to sit on a nail in the in the closet and stay here all night I hope you brought your blanket it like really mean when you're like a little six-year-old kid like that's fucked up it's just a weird about see how to be stuck with these people for 9 months and also for me my parents are splitting up with the time so it's very confusing and I wanted things to have order to them so I wanted God to make sense I remember annoying people with that watches this God want that I don't say that when he was 6 years old because I was a little kid who is dealing with my parents splitting up and it didn't seem too many order in the world and I was very nervous right so when I

<timemark seconds="10594" />

find when I went to Catholic school when I first got there I was I was happy that I was going to go to Catholic school but then as I experienced it

<timemark seconds="10604" />

6 years old this is ridiculous this is my first of all these people are so mean they're they're obviously being mean and nasty to not comforting and I was thinking is a six-year-old comparing in the way like my grandma was my mother was like these are these ladies are nasty you being so mean I need to see kids getting in trouble because their parents hadn't paid for their lunch or they scan it and it was like this really you tell your father to get that money in like there was a missed two at that just didn't seem loving or didn't seem like what I thought of when I thought of you know Christ and when I thought of Ryan it seemed to me like a whole know this is a dark little trap sucked into about that is not just the age but that you went from

<timemark seconds="10655" />

really really needing it in a very real way cuz what was happening with your family too

<timemark seconds="10662" />

like normally you wouldn't turn that quickly within a year that sounds like it was over by the time I was out of there 15-20 outside of beating me or doing something sexual to me the distal mind-fuck of dealing with those mean nasty ladies scared the shit out of me crying I'm like whoa just not knowing how to deal with human beings having a 6 year old in this is going down like what have I done yeah I don't want from always being with my mom or being with my grandma my grandfather's like everything is cool in school and this is what you do in school and go to kindergarten I went to first graders the first thing I went to be connected these crazy ladies Jesus was like oh no I think about them

<timemark seconds="10717" />

don't think what kind of like I don't think about why this I mean remember being like 6 years old thinking that I love them like they have a family friend and I didn't take the time to have a girlfriend but maybe they do holla but you're sure they didn't the whole thing was that they didn't you know they didn't have any but no connection with another human being that will be lonely or it more angered inducing dark loving people you know any of your children about God my my basic take is Jordan Peterson said something really lovely he said he behaves as if God is real

<timemark seconds="10764" />

he behaves as if God exists interested not that he believe God exists cuz that's sort of yeah bit of an intellectual trap right beside you believe God exists like okay Define God now they have in your in the weeds yeah cuz if you think that I think that there's a city in the clouds No I don't right now I don't know what do you think that there's an energy like yourself or something bigger than all this thing world is bigger than everything like if you would talk to an ant and said him and you think of cities at skyscrapers and airplanes like what you fucking moron get out of here bitch how you talkin any what time for your fucking Galaxy talk when you're 5 G pitch I have time so I mean in our perspective when we're talking about things

<timemark seconds="10,814" />

it's like we're we're so small the way we interface with reality so crude even though it's amazing yeah but I like the idea of the not going into the whole intellectual discussion about God but just like you know who just got to act like he has exist so yeah it's not it's like a parent figure it's like okay we're not going to do this because it's going to make them on the happy I try to do what I like the mud I'm at my best I try to treat people as if they're me living another life treat treat people as if they're just a you know don't think people as a bother or don't the ends hard to do it's hard to do especially when you're busy or when you have your kids with you or when you try to get some done that's hard to do I just walk around thinking everybody is drowning and insecurity that really kind of makes me

<timemark seconds="10,875" />

give people a pass in the biggest and smallest ways everybody when you see people hustling do whenever businessman business woman looks like she's on top of her game person like I'm a Subway he's obviously going someplace they don't want to go with no money in their pocket if you realize we're all just drowning and insecurity it just makes you just give them a little bit of a pass that that's been where my head's at been at lately that's a great place to keep your head because we all are Meyer the most it's like well you know we were talking about earlier about the traps you fall into as you're trying to achieve and do things and you also fall in the traps even when things you love and you can get so caught up in the things that you love that you kind of forget to keep your

<timemark seconds="10,932" />

you know you're you're you're you're when you're at your best like what and what feeling or keep that in close range yeah I feel like getting away from you because you're too tired cuz you working too much yeah I was like she pulled it back yeah keep keep it at close range where you are operating at your best but be respectful of that right and I think this is something that I've been guilty of in the past I wasn't respectful of the energy that's required to be at your best I just figure that like I'll just do all the other things yeah but the only I really firmly believe you only have so much bandwidth in a day and this is coming from a person pushes their bandwidth too hard all the time I think you only have so much in a day and when you get to a certain State you one of diminishing a lot and I think you want of diminishing a lot of the all the other things you do like if you if you have like 7 Things cooking in the background on your phone it's not going to move as fast actually does work on some computers but I do that to you have too many things cooking at the same time

<timemark seconds="10,992" />

yeah what time all the time and then you take 20 minutes of Transcendental Meditation and take your nervous system and put it on restart and just let it wash out freaking me out let it wash out 20 minutes because we're all under that all the time a hundred percent frazzled no matter how hard you're pushing or just coasting

<timemark seconds="11,018" />

3 in the afternoon 2 o'clock in the afternoon 4 o'clock in the afternoon that nervous system shot but we're all the same how do you do 20 minutes what do you do talk me through and take your nervous system and it's the result of it is you come out and you rebooted the system and you can now have a good part of the second part of your day do you have a technique used use an app do I went to I went to a transcendental meditation teacher and

<timemark seconds="11,049" />

without the hippy-dippy that's the biggest part of it it literally makes you realize just what you said we're all just frazzled and running out of steam at a certain point your nervous system is shot all that stuff that's happened just between 7 and 3 whatever would happen you're that nervous system has been dealing with a ton of stimulus all day long

<timemark seconds="11,072" />

that meditation

<timemark seconds="11,075" />

gives you a reboot and you can it's a it's like a needed thing that's better than sleep that you do that you're actually yearns for I'm telling you since I really started dialing it in and and did it it the best way I can describe it is that it added another 4 hours to my day oh yeah

<timemark seconds="11,100" />

how so

<timemark seconds="11,102" />

because I would just be limping across the Finish Line I'd be exhausted I be trying to do and with motivation and I work really hard I would push through and get to maybe you know two hours more of what I needed to accomplish

<timemark seconds="11,119" />

can you do this effortlessly without struggle I'm able to just say like I did between 9 and 12 that day yes A hundred percent do you think by using his practice your alleviating tension so you're more efficient with your energy like what makes you that's part of it but it really is it really is taking this nervous system that is dealing with the outside world all the time and just giving it a real practical way to shut down flat line and then come back on the grid yeah

<timemark seconds="11,160" />

and yeah

<timemark seconds="11,162" />

and it it like your physical body needs a rest your things need to be rebooted your nervous system is kind of this thing that operates all the time that we're not really that conscious up we're not really that aware that how hard it's working and this is a way to pay attention to it and give it a chance to regenerate for like since College just out of reading books

<timemark seconds="11,190" />

and then probably about 3 years ago my friend said you always did Transcendental Meditation he said go just to see if it dials you in is actually the stuff you are doing the way you talk about meditating it sounds more laborious sounds like you're doing too much work just go talk to this guy and I did for like three four sessions I would just talk to this guy here in La who's a transcendental meditation teacher and he just explained it and dialed me in on it and for the last 3-4 years I've been just I haven't missed a day and three or four years every day 7 Days 7 days no cheat day one from a cheat day it's like 20 minutes if you can get to in that's the best if you can get one in the morning one in the afternoon then you're like Superman but if you can get one in

<timemark seconds="11,250" />

I'm telling you start to finish how long 20 20 minutes so I can you do this every day every day every day how easy-going you are like it but like you said dude I love and Tom Pappas and you podcast cuz it's so easy going like the way you guys jail so well together you flow together yeah your tune in to Santa's present together we're just we're both you know River and it lets you just kind of go underneath catch your breath and then come back up into it do you feel that way when you exercise do you feel like when you exercise you get into lucke-zone and you reset your brain for sure I feel blessed I feel less depressed when I exercise like if I'm in a funk and I like and I go for a run I'm like my days different yeah it's weird it's almost like that funk is trying to hold on

<timemark seconds="11,310" />

Troll Tooth weird yeah it's like it's tricking your brain yeah I do you feel like shit today that's why I told me just put these God damn shoes on to go run yeah you know you feel so good but the meditation is different the meditation is like the the run will give me energy I won't feel so shity I might go I'm okay and I feel good I feel alive and whatever but the meditation in a very subtle way

<timemark seconds="11,336" />

5 hours later when you're faced with a stressful situation you don't feel as stressed as you normally would because it's just your nervous system which is very powerful has been rebooted is now able to go and deal with another situation you should go see him okay I'll do it I'll give you the name of the guy he's amazed that mean he's not amazing it's not it's not the one sperm guy it is not about him $1000000 he's just delivering the message of this little practice which is Barry is not hippy-dippy it's very practical tactical can use it yeah that's the best part of it would you be if you tried to tank before in the float tank now would you be interested in doing it and we have one here I can use it anytime you want I would like I would like to hear what your take on it is especially especially if you wanted to practice those techniques in

<timemark seconds="11,395" />

yeah they'll be really interesting crazy environment man that would be great I should do it I'll do it yeah for sure or not today I'm drunk places around to this a float lab down in Venice and they have went with at Westwood and then what's the big place that's in Pasadena has the biggest one in the world and then he told you sign up going there and Float a giant yeah just float Pasadena shoot they don't they have like 40 fucking float tanks with some crazy shit

<timemark seconds="11,431" />

I don't know how many they have but I think they use all float lab stuff to that would be cool if you get the morning one and you know how sometimes you wake up you've slept you went to bed at 11 you're up at 7 but you're exhausted cuz your night sleep was Restless you got up to pee a couple times Munoz you look back at your bed it was just a disaster

<timemark seconds="11,456" />

you do those 20 minutes before you go about your day just before the kids get up just get 20 minutes in it's like at you it was more valuable than what you try to accomplish in 8 hours spinning around in the sheets like especially for someone like you write whose job is to create things yeah right to put your mindset into put into a particular place super beneficial if you just creating things all the time totally but it's for everybody write write write it down literally like we're all just human beings a struggling everyday going to be doing all this stuff in Psych you could be you know a single mom living in a city taking the bus to work after dealing with your kids and her nervous system is being bombarded 20 minutes just to kind of hot sitting there on the bus you could do it on the bus by your with all this other

<timemark seconds="11,513" />

it's not a pristine thing it's not a hippie thing it's not an was going to say elegant but it is kind of elegant it's not a special thing it really is just like like a controlled that in a way and it'll it just gives you more to go on we're all everybody no matter what you're creating no matter what you're doing we are all under a salt all the time right I mean not going to go to war but there's like bombardments of energy and stuff it's coming after you all the time you have to kind of 10 to the system that's dealing with that I think anything that gives you a perspective we shift or real reboot is great yeah everything going for a swim in the ocean and what whatever the fuck it is something that gives you a perspective reboot and some pretty gross rats

<timemark seconds="11,573" />

we have these views of the world

<timemark seconds="11,578" />

sort of

<timemark seconds="11,579" />

we have this these patterns that we should recognize we see em they're out there we got locked into them and we're just visiting the same websites and seeing the same people and doing the same things everyday yeah sometimes you need something different yeah some knock you out you need something that gets you to think about other stuff yeah I know maybe it's going to a place that this is why I travel so good I used to never get travel when I was a kid but when I do like being home but want to think about travel as it allows you experience the feel of someone's culture in real life and you're walking through the streets of Cologne Germany like you like these people live appreciation if there's different rules over here but these are still people modern people just like you yeah and it's some of your ancestors came from here to hit send but here they are with his different rules millions of millions of people

<timemark seconds="11,639" />

they're coming into them from Africa and it's like what is crazy I guess that this whole thing is like fascinating and that you were around you know Pompeii and you see me the real ones that we were Mount Vesuvius erupted wandering through all the stuff like this is fascinating it's a long way from thinking about the three apps that you sit on your phone everyday and get your news get your thing and that's a whole nother whole nother mine blower oh my God it's a whole universe of other stuff to think about that's why I love walking in New York but you have your routines of like where you're walking on the other side of the street and go the other direction you're a wild man and you if you just look the other way from when you normally are like doing your thing it's a whole nother perspective it's a whole nother world it's crazy

<timemark seconds="11,699" />

either way running the other direction it's this true but it's not a small thing because we like the order we like that provides, and saved you just going that same rude all the time but then there's a limit I guess and you end up it starts acting negatively on your life and you're right if you just a constant Vagabond travel around the globe that's probably not not positive either right yeah always going on that I love having a home I love home yeah I love him too I love home which is so weird in a career where we have to travel so much but I love to say like a good evil but there's some weird sort of balance in this life and that we do really have to experience negative things to appreciate positive things for what they really are if everything is positive if you're the lottery winner when you're 5 if you win that golden Power ticket

<timemark seconds="11,759" />

500 million J me when you're 5 years old and it's all made then you don't have to imagine that you've grown up and ruin your life like listen little Tommy you never have to work again it would ruin your life free ticket when you are 5 yeah if you'd be so nice to give us some of that money that would be nice but I bet you have a 790 million dollars but how do you turn 18 but you could give us some of it now there's a sign right here, Billy you would be fucked growing up being like Richie Rich yeah I know you'd like what the fuc being mad at you have a face full of cocaine chasing this feeling that you can't get just from practical everyday work comic books
