<timemark seconds="465" />

what what happened to civilization what happened to the surface of this planet what happened at end of the Ice Age and one of the things that points to is the work of Randall Carlson who is spent 30 plus years of his life studying asteroidal and Comet impacts on Earth the same thing was an asteroid impact that, back to the size of it either way big rocks from space fuck this up and that's why we're going to talk about and ancient civilizations and most importantly when talk about evidence photographic evidence if you're listening to this podcast we make several references to photos a couple hours in and you can always check those out on YouTube cuz the YouTube version will be exactly the same as the YouTube version will be exactly the same as the iTunes or audio version whatever podcast app to use whatever

it's the same so you can go back and you'll want to because it really puts it into perspective there's some images that he shows where you draw just drops you off when you think about the origins of the great flood and most likely what happened we got discuss that on this podcast I don't give any spoiler alerts but we got fucked up long time ago probably twelve thousand years ago we got jacked up please welcome without any it stop saying that for a while

<timemark seconds="549" />

please give it up for my friends Randall Carlson and Graham Hancock

The Joe Rogan Experience

<timemark seconds="560" />

and we live gentleman here we go again what's happening back in the room a pleasure to see you guys as always this is one of my favorite podcast that we ever do and this is very timely because first of all the big New York Times article about the the possibility of a comet hitting Los Angeles the preparations for what they would do if a comet hit Los Angeles and the comment no has Donald Trump that's hit the United States and even got the hair I mean if the end of the world was coming boy it's all on the wall in the writings are there it's kind of crazy so what's the latest in the greatest well the latest the latest in the greatest hits live me last year when we sat down with you I think it was last November there was almost a year that floated in the discussion the idea that this really important, tressurge that's going on which is just changing our whole view of history and prehistory out of the future

<timemark seconds="620" />

of humanity but it would be good to make a film about this in crowdfunded I actually mentioned that to the scientist and they said what we really need is more funding for our research and so they inspired by basically by your show they have put out a crowdfunding campaign which is linked on my on my website it's the comet research group and it's it's a big story right now too so how can people find it really quickly it's Indiegogo research much quicker way to my website hancock.com which is the research group and you're in this beautiful okay Graham Hancock. Calm and then crowdfunding for Comet research and so what are they you are trying to put together well they're they're wanting to replace these guys are actually not had any official funding this is a group of major highly credentialed scientist do for the last decade have been investigating the extraordinary story of a massive commit Siri

<timemark seconds="680" />

Comet impacts on the North American ice cap 12800 years ago that is the global cataclysm butt wipes out a whole civilization from from prehistory so that's why it's of interest me then I'll come and get it from that point of view that coming at it from rediscovering something that we lost about ourselves some of these really important to understand the role of cataclysms in the story of the air and they need to do much more research they need to go back to Greenville and look for the nine of diamonds in the in in the Greenland ice cores they need that there's an ancient city which they not revealing the name of witch that pretty certain was wiped out by a comet impact about four and a half thousand years ago they want to go back and investigate that says Love Field what they need to do to drive home this hypothesis and to frankly put down the opposition because there's been so much opposition to this idea from people with vested interests in other theories that's that's why these guys have not got funding so the only place that going to get funding to do this for the research

<timemark seconds="740" />

is from members of the general public and that's what we're hoping that will will happen it's going to Comic research group there's a banner on my side and all the Links at that to that crowdfunding to that website which is full of masses of scientific information on to their Facebook pages what it is a very unusual thing the the fact that we know the comments and all sorts of various large objects have impacted the Earth we we we see the craters we know they exist but so rarely discussed it's so it's so strange if it wasn't for this article the New York Times I can't remember one last time and that it even came up and it's such a huge issue to massive issue a massive issue both Robert and I have really going to give it a great deal of thought so that's nothing Randall the point is that catastrophes are the untold story of our past

<timemark seconds="789" />

we were given a little we're given a little hint of it February of 2013 Chelyabinsk Siberia yeah I was about 50 feet in diameter which is about and it came in at a fairly low angle of blew up nearly eighteen right in front of me like this easier just better exploded 12 miles about 20 kilometers up in the atmosphere but it was still enough to damage thousands of buildings and injure 1500 people know the thing about that one is if it had been slightly larger if it had come in at a slightly steeper angle a little bit higher velocity you could have had thousands of fatality rather than just injuries and that would have been major headline news at that point as it was it's already forgotten but you do remember that day we met

<timemark seconds="849" />

videos of it has so many of those trail cam that not trail camera dash cam photo cameras have so much for insurance fraud apparently over there slam into each other all the time we want to record it so we're fortunate enough to have so many of those videos because of that which puts it on the record whereas other otherwise it would it would not be I think people don't you don't like to talk about cataclysms and catastrophes I'm actually know the why nobody wants a horrible cataclysm to occur but this is the point which is that the prospect of a comet or asteroid cataclysm on the earth is actually much higher than has been told to us up till now and something can be done about it doesn't have to be the end of the well we don't have to you know say Okay Soul ever forget about it quite the contrary this is this is just something that would be prudent and rationale for the human species to do and amongst many other imprudent and irrational things that we

<timemark seconds="909" />

focus on instead we should be focusing on a bid on this what we at least just heightened awareness of it and and also the possibility that we been nailed a bunch of times and we've forgotten about it and this is this is the big thing that you've been dealing with your entire career of this skepticism about past civilizations mean I got into it with Michael Shermer who's a friend of mine who's a very famous skeptic I got into him with it yesterday because I posted that you were going to be on and he started chirping something about it civilizations 12,000 years ago where's the evidence on my activity. And you're saying that you don't even know about Gobekli Tepe so I sent him go back in time and literally like 5 hours later he wrote something claiming that while that was made by hunter gatherers was all just really to sort of suit his narrative doesn't know that no one knows. He knows that to keep the existing motoland and when new evidence comes in which company explained by the existing model they just trying to explain away the New Evidence

<timemark seconds="969" />

not think maybe it's time to change out Theory you know this is this is the end of the unfortunate thing but cataclysms a global cataclysm the massive it then that happened 12800 years ago the younger dryas impact which were series of comet impacts on the North American ice cap this accounts for why we don't have a lot of evidence hard evidence of a 12000 + year old civilization because it went down in that catastrophe it was wiped out I've been trying to amass the evidence actually that compliments what Graham is doing and it really answers that question to Trimmer brought up and it's a legitimate question but I'm quite sure that Schirmer is not really educated in the extreme events that have really taken place on this planet in the last ten to twenty thousand years and what that would do to any kind of evidence and maybe while we have some time here today I brought a few things to try to convey some sense of how extreme some of these changes have been and how one

<timemark seconds="1029" />

would actually be quite shocked to find anything existing in the aftermath of these events Michael shermer's a brilliant guy but what what is disturbing to me is it his knee jerk reaction to this without having any research at all in the subject not knowing that all about Gobekli Tepe when you discovered in what the 90s to me this is something that I've looked at because of you guys in great depth when I read your book I was just completely enthralled inside Dia of History having some sort of rise and fall and civilization Havanese reset so I've been absorbed in it for a long time it was fascinating to me is people that consider themselves to be skeptical or you or I mean he's a skeptic professional each other but many people who question anything that's outside of what they've been told as soon as I hear any sort of a theory outside the weather but told the immediately call quackery this it but it's it's a weird knee-jerk reaction to something especially when you talk about asteroids

<timemark seconds="1089" />

it is a very real part of our past we have a ton of evidence I mean there's actual craters that you can look at on Earth the moon which has no atmosphere is littered with them and if we look at the Moon as a model for what could possibly have happened to Earth or at least you know some of them obviously with the moon have no atmosphere it's going to get hit a lot more than we are but still it mean this is a very real situation that this the solar system you know it was it was at least as far as we know the only shows solar system that deal with this but we know this isn't this a real issue may be seen in fact it's like you just said it on the one hand you ever scientist looking at the Earth and what they're realizing is that the Earth is pockmarked with scars in each of these scars represents a tremendously powerful catastrophe this happened in the history of the earth no that's accepted by mainstream science that did major catastrophes have happened in the history of the Earth but where this thing now is about to come full circle is the recognition that these kinds of catastrophes of also

<timemark seconds="1149" />

influence the rise and fall of civilization and a lot more a lot more extremely than than his been recognized up to this point and wild geologist in our scientists are looking at the surface of the Earth in realizing action to the surface of the Earth are imprinted into the surface of the Earth are hundreds of scars of which are undoubtedly are only a small percentage of the total that exist at the same time astronomers are looking out into your space and discovering that we cohabit space with a lot of stuff it's not as empty as we thought just went in the last six or seven weeks we've had to close flybys a previously undiscovered asteroid a previously undiscovered asteroids is the picat NASA keep saying well as you know that's why we've counted 1650 asteroids and none of them are going to hit the earth in the next hundred years well yeah that's true but what about all the ones I haven't counted which are estimated to run into hundreds of thousands of which haven't been seen yet and what happens is we see them roughly 10 days before they pass the earth that is

<timemark seconds="1209" />

enough time to do anything about them but we have time if we prepared to be rational and reasonable as a civilization to take care of this issue with objects are flying around what are the things that could be done to protect Earth you can paint it's it's low-tech actually you can paint one side of the asteroid affect its Albedo so that the sun's Rays push differentially on one side rather than the other at that will shift its orbit slightly has to be calculated you can give it a little knock with with a with a rocket basically you don't want to blow it up you don't want to turn you know you're one big piece of artillery shell into a buckshot you know what to do that you want to you want to move it into a safer orbit you can mount Jets on it people looking now to mining asteroids of course our power Society always goes our civilization always goes for the weather where the money is to be made but if we can mine asteroids we can move asteroids and on the technology is there and ironically the most dangerous asteroids

<timemark seconds="1269" />

the ones that are the closest to the earth which are the most accessible and the asteroids pretty much have unbelievable amount of resources on him I mean pretty much everything that is being mined on the earth can be found in asteroids from the hydrocarbons to Precious Metals. All of these things and we're not that far away from technologically being able to actually you know about expeditions to asteroids and mine them and that's that's the the you know that's the solution I kind of prefer because again these things are tremendous sources of Reese of of of all kinds of things that would be usable to an expanding civilization and we could feasibly within a decade or to be mining asteroids and again the ones that are the easiest to access are also going to be the ones that are more dangerous because they're the ones that are coming the closest to the earth so another Point here is that there is one specific

<timemark seconds="1329" />

danger there's one specific if you like region of the sky that really needs to be looked out of this is this is the region of the sky this is why I wrote magicians of the Gods because because of this discovery that there's a thing called the taurid meteor stream which is 30 million km wide and which envelops the solar system and the Earth on its orbit around the sun passes through the taurid meteor stream twice a year turns out the taurid meteor stream is the debris of a giant Comet that came into the inner solar system about 20,000 years ago that thing was at least a hundred kilometers in diameter according to the calculations it may have been more so and then like other comments like shoemaker-levy 9 which spectacularly hit Jupiter in 1994 it began to break up into multiple fragments of those carrion orbiting on the original path which and as they break up more and more they degrade and small bits of large bits break off and it gradually fills up a kind of huge hoop of debris that the Earth is passing through

<timemark seconds="1389" />

twice a year Texas 12 days to pass through it we do two and a half million kilometres a day on a Robeson Park 12 days to get through the taurid meteor stream and the scientists of the Comet research group I made the point that a big object out of the taurid meteor stream multiple objects as a matter of fact what's what hit the North American ice cap 12800 years ago it looks like that was a second series of impact 11600 years ago from the same Source it looks like there were other impacts in the Bronze Age the most recent almost definite impact out of the taurid meteor stream was tunguska in Siberia back in 1908 that hit on the 30th of June 1908 and that's at the peak of the torrid June shower when we pass through the toys in June and and in November and what they're saying is we really need to focus on this toys meet you stream their calculations all that there are hundreds and hundreds of massive objects in that towards me to stream and you know as a comet breaks up into bits it becomes

<timemark seconds="1449" />

those bits become asteroids and those asteroids are circling in the Torrey Mediastream and I likened it to strapping on up a blindfold on Crossing an eight-line interstate twice a year I'm just hoping that we don't hit any heavy traffic you know that we meet bicycles or motorcycles rather than rather than trucks but the trucks are out there and what the compass research group scientist saying is we need now to be in-depth investigating the taurid meteor stream because it appears to be The Hidden Hand in human civilization it is wiped out episodes of our history in the past and there's no reason to expect that it won't do so a game unless we do something about it because the remnants about original giant Comet a still circling in the taurid meteor stream and they are fucking dangerous is being received in mainstream science I mean it is there any resistance to this because it seems like this is all pretty straightforward and in traceable mostly being ignored mostly being ignored by scientists who have a vested interests

<timemark seconds="1509" />

other ideas first of all that has a vested interest in not admitting the cataclysms are important at all this goes right back to really to the 19th century when science began to take shape in the form that we know it now and they wanted to separate themselves off understandably from Superstition so I didn't want anything to do with something that sounds like the biblical flood for example they felt they would be contaminated by the hot and they they prefer to explain any cataclysmic evidence as a result of gradual process is so you really think it's because of the reluctance to accept religion or religious ideas or two to separate them so that's where it starts word started to separate them from that. They've gone a long way from that and many many scientists have got a vested interest in what is called uniformitarianism or gradualism and they they don't like to hear about cataclysms having any major impact on the story of life on Earth so is it sort of the momentum of these initial desires to escape religious influence that a sort of let them down this path

<timemark seconds="1569" />

yes and then there are others who have a vested interest in current accounts of global warming others others who have a vested interest in extinctions taking place now they want to save that our ancestors were responsible for the extinction of all the mammoths and mastodons and so on and so forth whereas the compass research group scientist saying no those huge megaphone of North America were wiped out at the result of the massive series of impacts on the North American ice Co I'm reading a book right now by Dan Flores really interesting book called coyote America he's a wildlife historian and he is really an expert on all the different forms of wildlife in North America where they originated where they migrated to and one of the more fascinating things about it is he's talking about all these animals that went extinct you know 10000 + years ago this mass extinction event and never once does he bring up cataclysm and there's all these different has different ideas and one of the big ones being the human beings with Al attles which is like really a very weird sort of a spear-throwing device and wiped out the wooly mammoths and all

<timemark seconds="1629" />

other animals and if you have any contact with hunter gatherer is today you find the hunter-gatherer people's don't over kill their game they they hunt them respectfully they take what they need and they leave the rest because it's a renewable resource for them so I don't think hunter gatherer is wiped out that the mammoths in North America the evidence is compelling it was the comment while the evidence that you brought up when you were here the first time when you show the images of all those mammoths that had been literally knocked over with broken legs from the impact of something Mass burial grounds if he's Mast it is not burial ground obviously but Mass casualties were there just several dozen nobody knows how many are actually they are but there's at least several dozen two species wooly mammoths in Columbian mammoths it have been entombed

<timemark seconds="1689" />

and while we were there I interesting that you know that the guy that woman giving us the the tour there was kind of giving me a gradualist explanation that well over long periods of time these mammoths wander into a sinkhole and we're too dumb to get out and so they became into him that I asked a question well what studies have been done on The Descent ementary Matrix in which there remains are being found because I'm looking at the sedimentary Matrix I'm seeing a massive deposit there in other words that deposit that was instantaneous she actually got very irritated and dismissed my question didn't know what we've got it all worked out you know we we we know about that well what is it well you just we've got it all worked out and then immediately went on with your narrative lights but yet I had an article that was actually written by one of the original scientists worked on the site and he he his description was well it could have been

<timemark seconds="1749" />

that but also as an alternative and he was the term bloat and float that what you had was woolly mammoths that had been caught in a flood round and their bloated carcass has floated into a depression in the landscape and that's where they were entombed and that makes a whole lot more sense to me than the fact that you know individually over several thousand years these in these mammoths wandered into the sinkhole and then couldn't get out but you got to be in mind we're talking about the end of the last ice age a hundred and twenty roughly species of megafauna disappeared which is about equivalent to the same number of megafauna species that inhabit the Earth today was a short. Of time with something like 65% of the North American mammals went extinct 75 / 75 per-cent of very short. Timer totally coincident with that. Called the younger dryas and so there's nothing resembling what we're capable of doing today back then I mean when you look at you mix tinction events human-caused

<timemark seconds="1809" />

Extinction events was very logical when what we're doing today with pollution in the expanse of civilization and weapons or super sophisticated if we wanted to we could wipe out a lot of different species yet but we're actually seeing is that at the end of What's called the bowling alley Rod which was the gradual warming at the end of the last ice age that preceded the sudden catastrophic change 12800 which of the Clovis culture that existed for three to five hundred years I think yes but you were gone interesting studies that coming out now showing at least Continental why there was apparently a major human population crash exactly coincident with the megafauna extinction because you had Cory's that had been mine for centuries that are suddenly abandoned you have campsites that had been that had generations of debris and in toolkits accumulating and so on

<timemark seconds="1869" />

Bree from the from the flooding of the the spear points and so on that are suddenly abandon right so the evidence actually suggest that the human population crashed which would certainly imply that they would been far less capable of wiping out all of these species of megaphone also the the studies have their their diet and their lifeways suggest that they were very quite diverse they were hunter-gatherers and they focus mostly on small game that a lot of fish by the shellfish they they gathered food and why would they go after the biggest most dangerous animal you know in the in the whole in the whole array of Havana station Sea Hunt them to Extinction than a hundred years it doesn't make sense it mean any special trips from that time if I may say so mention the Clovis culture this is a very long time really until just a couple of years ago all of the mainstream academic center field

<timemark seconds="1929" />

archaeology and anthropology was saying there was no human beings in North America before that's a 13,000 years ago give or take five hundred years so they came across the Bering land bridge the Bering Strait at that time was above water sea level is lower they entered the Americas then they wouldn't have it for now in the last two to three years that's just being a whole raft of new scientific research and no scientist today is prepared to defend the Clovis model anymore it's accepted of course that that being human beings in America for 50,000 60,000 years and there's weird genetic links like for example there's a trace that connects Aboriginal Australians with North Americans they had a common ancestor it's a very peculiar thing that's going on I'm so what what happens is that actually these scientific models which constrain and restrict research for so long do get overthrown and that Clovis model is being overthrown and what the missing piece of the puzzle puzzle I think for everybody working this field is the cataclysm the comet what happened between 12

<timemark seconds="1989" />

811600 years ago was changed everything you guys are frustrating in any way that this is not a Main Street idea this is this is very much French but yet it's it's not something that we don't have any of it whenever whenever I put out a book I'm immediately says this is a huge hostile reaction to Michael shama thing like I mean I would say magicians of the gods are published in 2015 which deals with this whole, tissue is actually the most thoroughly documented the most thoroughly reference book that I've ever written it's calm it's measured they actually don't read it they just say oh Hancock brought out another book He's a pseudo scientist that's what they always call me or a pseudo archaeologists and it's obviously rubbish because it disagrees with everything that we know well that's the point of a heretic in society is to offer an alternative View and I'm well documented evidence but it seems that we're dealing with such a deeply ingrained mindset which is connected in

<timemark seconds="2048" />

raceways to power structures in our society that is very difficult to change it absolutely in Indian like Graham mentioned earlier there's kind of a tree and now it's more of a political motive and again the idea that every day you'll find something you know coming from various factions that over destroying the Earth and the Earth is never suffered this kind of you know assault on it before and and you know what causing the sixth grade mass extinction and we're going to cause catastrophic global warming if we pump another 50 or a hundred parts per million of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and and so what that is done is like many I'm almost a many but several of the scientists now that have been in the Forefront of criticizing the younger dryas impact hypothesis are also very much involved in the global warming movement in the idea that we are now precipitate

the sixth grade mass extinction having look now at it mass extinctions and been really an obsession of mine for about 30 years now I've looked at everything from the cretaceous-tertiary that's permanent Riyadh you know right on down the line to the most recent one which to me is really in some ways the most interesting because the most recent mass extinction that were talking about is the one that took place while we humans were part of the of the story and between 12800 and 11600 years ago the younger dryas switch is still unexplained climate anomaly that happened and I mentioned this I think you're looking previous broadcast it's you know what you had was you had to spasm of of extreme warming followed by rapid shifting into extreme cold literally within a matter of a few years and we're talking about climate changes that are up to 15 degrees Fahrenheit within perhaps one to five years which other lead War

anything that we've experienced in the last since the Industrial Revolution began and we still don't really understand and that's why this research is so important because now we understand that there was something Cosmic that happened it's left its imprint in the landscape / what four continents five continents have other over 50 million square kilometers of the earth's surface is a giant giant Deborah field of the best stuff that is only produced by Massive impacts these things come in at 70,000 miles an hour and you know if they have any diameter at all if there if they're a hundred meters or more in in diameter they are they are going to hit the Earth really hard then I'm going to bed up in the atmosphere and when they do they pack a huge amount of kinetic energy a huge amount of heat and shocking that creates very definite chemical products so nanodiamonds soak almonds fabuloso melt glass looks like the trinitite that was produced in nuclear explosion

<timemark seconds="2229" />

all of these when they're all found together in the same layer of soil and when you can put a date on that layer of soil and when it's all over the world there's only one thing can explain them a massive cuz I don't understand why this is controversial I really don't I mean I do I understand it because I know that once people start teaching things once people start doing lectures and giving speeches they they they want to stick to their guns and they wanted they want to somehow or another avoid anything is going to contradict what what they've been espousing the way we've looked it up on state changes the whole story of archaeology and it changes the way we're going to look at the future I think that people in Academia are reluctant to embrace that change their afraid of being cold pseudoscientist cuz that's a whole Lobby of Skeptics who use this word pseudo scientist or pseudo archaeologist as an instant dismissal of other ideas and those who are we in the profession they don't want to get tarred with that brush they want to keep himself

<timemark seconds="2289" />

clean and pure steel about hard evidence glass diamonds you're talking about core samples that show this massive shift when you do the ice core samples massive shift in temperature and you're talking about but very clear evidence of impacts that we we know exists not like a comet's a theory that's not like it's Bigfoot or something like you know I could we're looking for the final piece of evidence to show that, is real thing exactly is really it's towed it's totally it's totally real but it's so difficult for those who are invested in other models to accept and unfortunately they have the ear of the media it's the it's in there are open to all the scientist in the comic comic research group are absolutely mainstream scientists and they have taken a lot of flak from their colleagues for even daring to investigate this area that's why they've had no funding they not defend themselves so well that is so crazy because this is not a controversial thing in my mind should be it should not be this is not an Airy fairy thing when I talk about psychics or not.

<timemark seconds="2349" />

about UFOs we're talking about something we know exists so to bury your head in the sand over something like this seems to me vested interest spending the equivalent of 1 attack helicopter a year on investigating the the comet and asteroid danger in a 50 million dollars a year billions of dollars on on massive sophisticated military equipment which we can use to slaughter one another and have a more sophisticated ways but just 50 million dollars a year on saving the Earth from from a potential cataclysm that could put our civilization back into the Stone Age tomorrow and I don't mean to keep harping on Michael Shermer because I like Michael but that he highlights this sort of natural inclination to poke fun at something that he is done no research on whatsoever when I pointed out Gobekli Tepe and I sent him some articles from National Geographic he went radio silent I mean

<timemark seconds="2409" />

he should know about it. People who actually know what you're up to say that was created by hunt together as well I'm sorry it's just a theory that's not it that's not a fact I mean you seem very very sophisticated site with astronomical alignments with hundreds and hundreds of megalithic tail is wagging after 20 tons each the world's first perfectly aligned north south building would you can only do with astronomy this is that's not enough to say oh they would just hunt together is there was something extra ones from a half a mile away station me what how big were the stones well the biggest one I actually still in the Quarry they left it because it had a Fulton it they clearly intended to move it 50 tons you looking at 20 foot high I'll just is the putting together of them see his the problem hunter-gatherer societies are not the kinds of societies that produce large scale fixed monuments why because they

<timemark seconds="2469" />

generate a surplus you can't pay for somebody to become an architect on somebody to come in a storm busy hunting and Gathering and that's what you do hydroculture generates a surplice and that's the bet is the problem of Gobekli Tepe because there is no background this site just appears out of nowhere amidst what appears to be a hunter gatherer Community but what they're not considering is the possibility we looking at the technology transfer that the survivors of A Lost Civilization who already had all that knowledge came to go back to the Tepee and use that site as a center of initiation to teach the local hunter-gatherers how to do Agriculture and that's now taken as the beginnings of civilization I would say it is the reinvention of the wreath-making of civilization so when we're looking back at Sumer in any artifacts we find in ancient Mesopotamia in that area Iraq those are the people that are sort of Reinventing and relearning

<timemark seconds="2528" />

Two Rivers the Tigris and the Euphrates Gobekli Tepe is sitting right there in the headwaters between the Tigris and the Euphrates and we cannot separate that from the later cultures that end of History 5000-6000 years ago that part of the lineage that descended from Gobekli Tepe times and what's fascinating about Gobekli Tepe is the way it doesn't fit the way there's no background to it that you would expect to see them practicing learning architectural skills the oldest stuff should be the worst and as they carry on it gets better that site run for a thousand years the best stuff is the oldest a thousand years later what they were producing wasn't so good this is a real anomaly and it needs to be investigated not mocked by Skeptics but actually explored to consider maybe this does rock the whole paratime and it's kind of ironic that in their desire to get away from the ancient myths and tales in the Bible they've ignored those ancient myths and tales which all talk about cataclysms well part of our modern psychology is to imagine that we are somehow

<timemark seconds="2588" />

how far Advanced from our predecessors that we now represent the Pinnacle of civilization and anything to preceded us has to be looked upon almost as you know is if the workings of children it requires a major psychological shift to admit or accept that our ancestors it may have been far far more sophisticated than than we had imagined in our 19th century models which basically still dominate thinking today and you know what engrams book he devotes several chapters to the story of 119 20th Century Heritage J Harlen Bretz and his story to me kind of encapsulates the whole the whole process of forcing is paradigm shift in 4 years he was out there exploring this evidence that there had been a tremendous flooding in the end in Washington state and all of his critics were dismissive without ever even going out and looking at the evidence first hand in the field but what he did was he stuck

<timemark seconds="2648" />

these guns for three decades and continue to amass evidence to the point where they just couldn't they couldn't dismiss it anymore and finally a group of them went out and begin to explore the the the landscapes for themselves in one of the the leaders I think you talked about it in your book James gillooly who was sort of the leader of the the Skeptics faction that we had set out their sole purpose was to discredit an inlay this whole flood heresy to rest once and for all but he went out in the field and they spent about eight days in the field

<timemark seconds="2684" />

where he's seeing this evidence for himself over and over again and when you look at just one piece of it you might be able to say okay there's all other explanations for that but what happens is when you get multiple lines of evidence all converging and there's no way to individually explain away each one of those things other than just hang out while it's all coincidence what he this James. He was honest enough so that after a week out there they were to place called Palouse Falls in southern Washington which was one of these areas were these tremendous Inland tsunami swept across the land and I've actually just visited there about eight weeks ago when I took a group of people out there and hand and took them to Palouse Falls to show them right on the spot where James gillooly was standing when he finally had his Epiphany jelly images of that and that you brought with us I have images I can pick him up here yeah I got sure do yeah I've got some really interesting images to show you which one

<timemark seconds="2744" />

see this flooding stuff relates directly to the idea of the impact and we can get into a little bit of that explaining how how these parallel lines of of evidence are now converging but the interesting thing about but gillooly was that in the end of the descriptions of the of the trip he wandered off by himself for a long time away from the group and was standing there looking at this massive cataract with 400-foot cliffs in this little tiny ribbon of water flowing over it and it's huge Canyon below it and the big boulders and he'd seen for whole week he been seeing their stuff and it finally got to the point where it was undeniable and he walked back to the group in the words out of his mouth verbatim or how could I have been so wrong and he finally admitted in it that was like a turning point and now and again Graham described as very effectively in the book how in a in a way the flooding

<timemark seconds="2804" />

amateur was hijacked and then placed within this more gradualistic context really to avoid the fact that it was something so anomalous and so such a departure from our modern experience that we had to look outside of our modern experience to find an explanation what they wanted to do was find something within our modern experience in this is the the Cornerstone of the uniformitarian approaches that we look for a modern example and then we extrapolate backwards from that and so what they did was they sell well in the modern turn in the modern world we have Pro glacial lakes lake that's at The Forum in front of glaciers and sometimes these Pro glacial lakes might be held in by an ice dam or another Glacier these ice dams will give away and they will cause

<timemark seconds="2854" />

pretty catastrophic flooding they're very common up and Iceland because you've got several volcanoes under the Vault of the Icelandic ice sheets and up there they use the term you all collapsed to describe these outbursts floods but here's the thing when you look at the Modern versions of it you basically are looking at floods that are less than 1000 of one single flow from these floods were talking about that happened near 12th and 13,000 years ago 1000 less than 1000 less than a thousand in Peak discharge and in total volume and it's so it in his been admitted in several places I've extracted the quote saying well we do a bit that this is a major extrapolation upwards but nevermind you know

<timemark seconds="2900" />

where is it never mind is so disturbing me see Holland brats for 30 years was walking the walk in the channeled scablands and what he saw was evidence for as he called it a humongous blood which which actually Rosenthal within velvet in 3 weeks and Andy went through Decades of being put aside by his colleagues insulted they mocked him they locked at Injustice the Skeptics do today but Christ of the evidence began to Mountain they couldn't deny it anymore that there had been there had been flooding and actually eventually they gave Holland Brett's J Harlen Bretz the Penrose metal which is the ultimate you know the ultimate bestowal of geology in America he got the Accolade and he said it that he was born more than 90 years old about time he said it that time he said all my enemies a dead so I have no one left to gloat over but the point is in a way that was nothing to gloat about because what they did was they they they separated him from his central idea instead of accepting that there had been one

<timemark seconds="2960" />

huge flood about was always his few they said oh that must have been 70 or 80 floods that caused all this damage and that's what we're that's what we are seriously challenged and right now it's so ironic in a way that the human desire for knowledge is what has led us to where we are today what we have this insatiable desire for knowledge and for Innovation but that seemed human desire to achieve is also what what's the leaders responsible for that and the ego blocks anything that's contrary to what you've already established as fact as soon as you see something that might throw a monkey wrench into the gears of what you've been teaching and practicing your whole life and I know that you've gone through this with Egypt your your whole issue with the Sphinx in with the doctor shocking John Anthony West was on the podcast the house was amazing

<timemark seconds="3020" />

flaked on my website with the details are on the toxin events page is hidden its in some church somewhere but I'm going to give a presentation and then I'm going to interview John live on live on stage first time I've ever done that I'm kind of podcasting and he's an amazing love that dude and in magical Egypt is I think we're most important things anybody could ever watch I think that DVD series is just insane it's so spectacular and so fantastic and next to going to Egypt with that which I haven't done I think that's probably the second best thing to get bad is an example of why we need Heretics the thing you say that a yes you're right we have this thirst for knowledge in this case human characteristic but also we get invested in particular position is it when people criticize those positions we take it as an existential threat and where we get all angry and hot and bothered about it if we allow that to happen too much we don't keep a place for Heretics in our society then we never going to do anything novel we're gradually going to get locked down ossified into the into the existing system we need Heretics John has

<timemark seconds="3079" />

in the leading heretic on Ancient Egypt for decades pointing out that we should listen to what they have to do Gyptian said that their civilization was not a development it was a legacy it was a legacy from the time of the Gods and that cost me back again to this whole issue of A Lost Civilization now when he was discovered it is Vindicated you in so many ways but what are the possibilities if any of more of these sites being exported and exposed are there or are there more that people are looking at right now or there any that are under the radar just a year ago at the bottom of the Sicily Channel at a depth of more than a hundred and twenty feet it's been underwater for at least nine thousand years is a huge megalithic sites before the discovery of Gobekli Tepe that site could never have been expired the dating is absolutely definite the Seas Rose and covered it at least nine thousand years ago we don't know how long it's stood there before it was covered by the rising Seas but there it sits on the water and I think under water

<timemark seconds="3139" />

deputies are van I've had a part to play in this over the years are are one of the ways forward we need to look at those areas because there was a 400-foot rise in sea level at the end of the Ice Age you looking at the amount of land that would be put together in say Europe and China added together that amount of land was swallowed by those Rising seas and archaeology has largely proceeded without taking account of those lost lands I'm not saying they haven't looked at all but that primarily in Marine archaeology interested in shipwrecks now this this megalithic site is there images of this so we can look at that I can probably find it at the bottom of the Sicily Channel try that try not to search on that pull that up Jamie so what is this look like as is and is has been clearly established this actually is the work of man this is not some sort of a yardang or something of course this dispute right of course but the main street is not going to just accept

<timemark seconds="3199" />

stop at night but again it's mainstream scientists found it there absolutely certain that they did it with a man-made site there holes drilled through these Mega list one of them is very very large there's a series of other megaliths roundabout it's not a natural thing so here we're looking at some of it right now so that's that big Big Lots right there oh wow this we can say without a logical sites the problem is dating them incredible megalithic temples all over the island of Malta not far away from this place incredible megalithic temples but they can't date the stone directly they have to date organic material associated with the stone and that can give them misleadingly young dates in a case of a site that's been covered by sea level rise that can be no argument nobody went down there and built. 9000 years ago it had to be built before the Seas Rose and that puts a minimum age on it. 9000 year what are the best images that we can look at cuz right now I'm just seeing rocks

<timemark seconds="3259" />

it's very difficult cuz I'm looking at something that's going to see those are those are the best images of it that exists but everyone in the Sicily channel so what what are the biggest pieces down there is it this right here is this what you're yeah that big thing big thing that I'm 30 feet long I think what leads you to believe that this is man-made

<timemark seconds="3286" />

the scientist who worked on it the fact that there are holes drilled through the stone the fact that you can go to neighboring areas like Armenia and find really Berry ancient megalithic sites where they have exactly the same kind of holes drilled through the stones and the whole seem to have been used for astronomical sightings now this site some assets be knocked over by the Sea it's falling down but we saying the same thing big make a list with holes drilled and you're also dealing with 9000 + years of erosion and Barnacle growth of all of that and the ocean is a difficult place to work you know current says all kinds of all kinds of problems Mexican Mafia well it is it doesn't make sense that if we do know for a fact and we do that the sea level Rose dramatically the end of the Ice Age it makes sense that some things would be buried under the water well in.

<timemark seconds="3346" />

the Ice Age whatever you know you don't have to talk about Advanced civilizations or anything but the during the Ice Age living on the coast lines and establishing your Villages communities everything on the coast have been probably one of the most benign places to get the you know because for one thing you're you're down to your see the sea level of the presence of the Seas is going to smooth out the climate and so forth so you know you're going to have more probably most cultural development during the Ice Age is going to be close to the to the Sea so it's going to be underwater now just like Grandma's talking about and so this to me is probably the future of of Archaeology is Marine archaeology where a lot of discoveries are going to be made and they're in that particular thing I mean there's a lot of megalithic structures around the world that if you set that thing up like this and put those siding holes through it

<timemark seconds="3401" />

wood would look precisely like scrape the Barnacles off of it you know any annoying saying oh it's proven but what it is we have to keep an open mind and say well there are some very strong similarities here so let's investigate this thing further and that's the whole point of all this is all of this stuff needs more research it doesn't need some Cavalier dismissal by somebody who's going to protecting their of their own Paradigm it needs more research on all fronts I mean because I think that there's enough evidence it is now accumulated to suggest that there is a deep history to the human species on Earth and we're just beginning to really appreciate how much deeper really is in the conventional models of history and rather than just waving an arm and in dismissing this with a skeptical Snee are skeptical sneer exactly has accepted scientific models of humanity when you're talking about super volcanoes right like the supervolcano of sixty seventy thousand years ago

<timemark seconds="3461" />

yeah I mean they're they pretty much accepted that wiped out of the vast majority of human beings on Earth and why is the supervolcano hypothesis so easily accepted but yet the asteroid impact a both of them a real events both of them are historically documented in fact we really don't we've never watch the supervolcano take over the world but we seen asteroids hit other planets we've actually watched shoemaker-levy like you were talking about before we bombarding Jupiter unbelievable impact CJ each each one of them would have wiped out all life on Earth at 5 if that's okay. Hit the earth will consider the possibility and again John Anthony West work is important here let's also consider the possibility that we have misidentified a number of structures that are standing in Plainview like the Great Sphinx Egypt

<timemark seconds="3521" />

LG read any age of logical text any encyclopedia actually they will tell you that thing was put there by a specific Pharaoh Pharaoh khafre of the fourth Dynasty roundabout 2500b that is not the fact that is an opinion but it's presented as a fight there is not a single inscription that relates the Sphinx to that fair another contemporary inscription thing from 2500 BC in fact there's nothing at all it's just the Assumption because it's close to a pyramid which they assume the same Pharaoh built a gain on the absence of evidence that the Sphinx must have been built by then but John Anthony West was the first to see that actually when we look at the Sphinx we looking at a highly eroded Stone object and that erosion is very odd and that's why he brought Professor Robert chalkfest of geology from Boston University to Giza in 1992 to look at the Sphinx and say what actually caused this weathering on the swings and shocking Me Gently so it what caused it was exposure to a

<timemark seconds="3581" />

very long. Of heavy heavy heavy rainfall and no such rains a phone in Egypt in the last five thousand years but they did for the younger dryas we had a prolonged right now from this comet impact is that ice cap was pulverized in a massive amount of ice water was thrown up into the upper atmosphere prolonged right now which could have been the cause of erosion on the Sphinx what has occurred new what discoveries have been discovered in the last year like what what is new that we can look at

<timemark seconds="3615" />

the intent of archaeology there's not much new Gobekli Tepe at the moment is in deep freeze it's right 30 miles from the Syrian border there's been a massive on a raft in the unrest in shunt your phone which is the main Town Archaeology is very difficult for them to to carry on that space is basically just Frozen Blair just sort of stopped they just kind of stumped you know and the fact is amazing number of these of these sites and other sites I visited from magicians of the Gods was ball back in the Lebanon absolutely stunning sight and again I'm convinced that that site is nuanced it is yes there is a Roman Temple there but they put that Temple dead because the site was sacred long before and there's this incredible u-shaped megalithic wool which surrounds Baalbek which does not appear to have any connection to the to the Roman structure at a toll again that's an area which is subject to tremendous unrest a difficult it is difficult for archaeologist to proceed but just just in two

<timemark seconds="3675" />

2014 they they made a huge new discovery at fall back of a buried block which weighs 1460 tons which was sitting there on the site they been working that site for a hundred years they only found it in 2014 1,000 tonnes 1460 is that two million pounds is that what that is like I don't know I compared to get one ton 2000 pounds to a to a ton to an Imperial ton so whatever had three zeros on a double and a 3-0 Sahara this amount of pounds and they found this just in 2004 today, in 2014 now there's another big one right beside it which is being in Plainview for about the last hundred years and it's astonishing to me that this one which is just below it was covered by sediment that they open actual calculator

<timemark seconds="3732" />

you might be the only person unless I never go anywhere without my calculator calculator nobody has one of those we're just talking about that yesterday Chicka Wow Wow Beck was also the site of many Mount model us that have been discovered there and it's really fascinating site that most people have overlooked me talk about ancient structures and that I absolutely have to resist diet I've got nothing against aliens but I don't need aliens to explain these things I think I much a much leaner and more elegant explanation for these huge ontological anomalies is a lost human civilization much better the alien thing is a bit of a distraction but of course there's aliens of course the universe is full of life but the ancient archaeological sites are not good evidence for that idea that they're very bad let you message the evidence

<timemark seconds="3792" />

I think we are dealing with a lost human civilization that ball back 20 feet above the ground we have three blocks of stone joined so closely together that you can get it edge of a sheet of paper between each one weighs more than 900 tons and they are 20 feet above the ground it's a stunning achievement is just absolutely astonishing how on Earth did they do and how does mainstream archaeology deal with the devil inside its surrounds it but it's not part of it in my view terms of your question what's happened within the last year to I would think they'd probably the most significant thing or are certainly right up there would be the the comic Research into Discovery I mean like this article to have right here which came out in 2014 so it's not that old a nano Diamond Rich layer across three continents

<timemark seconds="3852" />

consistent with major Cosmic impact at 12800 years ago and it's something like 2425 highly pedigreed scientist something is out of the country Search Group the scientist from the group who have funded all that research themselves they came out with another paper in 2050 the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences host a lot of that work as well and the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences get into trouble for hosting that work but they feel it's important so they keep on hosting it this is so spectacularly confusing to me because that's rocks outside and this is evidence is actually good way the stuff you can measure it you can you can run tests on it and find out what is components are this to me is so baffling it's very badly they had that brought another paper in 2015 and I won't go into the some of the details that boring but it's called a base in front of logical analysis and basically what they're at what they were looking at is it they ask themselves is it possible that this Avenue

<timemark seconds="3912" />

please nanodiamonds these melt glass the comments field could that be laid down gradually on the chronological analysis that they've done absolutely answers not know it was not laid down gradually this whole thing unfolded in a. Of about 24 hours what a night

<timemark seconds="3931" />

yeah and what had happened Joe was that for years archaeologists head recognize this up black matte layer at at about two dozen or more of the Clovis sites around North America which ever been over 50 of them that have been studied and it would see Vance Haynes who wrote an interesting paper saying that

<timemark seconds="3954" />

did he was the one who noted that below this black matte layer which is only 2 to 3 inches thick in most sites you found evidence of the Clovis Culture Your found their tool kits in their their spear points and so on you found evidence of the extinct megafauna but not above it you would find this evidence of this

<timemark seconds="3977" />

cultural activity and the megafauna right up to the bottom of the of the black mat layer but not above it so what finally happened was in 2007 Richard Firestone in Allen West and some of their colleagues and it was just basically a small group at that point took a look at this closer look and that's when they begin to discover these impact proxies usually right at the base of the layer and the Laird self is carbonaceous which suggests that there had been a lot of sick deposited which would imply widespread wildfires vectors to study off the right off the coast of California on the Santa Rosa Island zip pretty much concluded that there was just massive Wildfire so pretty much just annihilated everything and then this was preceded by the deposition of black matte layer and right at the bottom of this black matte layers where you find a nanodiamonds the magnetic greens to my crispy rolls the carbonaceous Spiros fullerenes

<timemark seconds="4037" />

do you find these impact boxes and they're not all the same at all the sites in fact that's been one of the things that the critics have seized upon but what they're doing is I think taking over simplified model and when you look at it, fragmentation event you could be looking at the individual pieces could be a very different compositions and what we were talking about earlier the taurid meteor stream

<timemark seconds="4061" />

I'm not convinced at this point it was necessarily just a single impact event it may have been a bombardment episode that may have lasted even several decades and may have been seized for a while and we were talking about this last night over dinner that there seems to be a second spasm at 11600 years ago it's also associated with a massive rise in sea-level a call there's two meltwater Speights meltwater Spike 1 a.m. meltwater Spike 1B I'm quite convinced that these meltwater spikes that have been documented by marine geologist in oceanographers are correlated with these melting events of the ice sheet that I've been looking at in terms of their their geomorphic consequences because some of these events that mean the only way I can describe some of these meltwater advances that the only modern analog to this would be a tsunami and we've seen some pretty devastating tsunamis within the last decade or two both

<timemark seconds="4120" />

Indonesia and Japan and I don't know if you've ever seen any of the like the video is that these tsunamis anybody listening it is definitely worthwhile to go online and look at some of these videos where you can actually see the unbelievably powerful effects of a of a 30 or 40 or 50 foot tsunami right now some of the Landscapes and I have a some images we can pull up here shortly are places in Montana or Idaho Washington where you literally had a tsunami sweeping over the land that was over a thousand feet deep and that's an Ami came off the ice cap it's a freshwater smelt water coming off this catastrophic melting of the ice sheet and I've traced the sources of some of these meltwater me to trip now up into the end of the plateau Country British Columbia looking for the source of this meltwater because in the conventional models now of these this flooding this that goes back to

<timemark seconds="4180" />

Harlen Bretz and basically what they've done is they said initially but there could have been no flood because Harlen Bretz didn't provide a source for the water they said they said well you're saying that all of this evidence in the landscape is evidence of the flood but what was the source of the flood and he didn't have a source so the critics and said what you don't have a source for the flood water there for the flood didn't take place then it's is the research of all if you had independent evidence accumulating in Western Montana by JT Pardee was with the US Geological Survey and he was investigating evidence that the mountain valleys of Western Montana it been filled up with an enormous volume of water and its volume of water seem to be exactly the same time as bright as floods

<timemark seconds="4230" />

he didn't assume that this was a giant Lake and because you can see in and we can I think we have some images I think Jamie has some images will pull them up shortly we're on the Mountainside you see the shorelines you know a thousand feet above the valley floor and what he then decided was that based upon an old 19th century interpretation by TC Chamberland that there had been an ice dam he said well there must have been an ice dam west of your somewhere in the Clark Fork Valley a giant Lake backed up burst through the ice dam and then this is what would have caused Harlen Bretz is flow so now the geological community of Shifting because number one the evidence is overwhelming and they can't deny it anymore but what they're doing is looking for a gradualist Paramore uniformitarian explanation so they immediately latched onto this one was a giant proglacial or in front of a glacial Lake in Western Montana well you're talking about somewhere

<timemark seconds="4290" />

between 520 and 550 cubic miles of water that's a lot of water right in in in a normally when you have a large late you have a huge catch with bass and it is feeding lots of streams and rivers that are feeding into that light when you look at that any of the big lights around North America you have the lake and then you have this big old catchment Basin and all of that feeding it in Lake Missoula the whole lake fills almost the whole catchment Basin it's like to me what they did was they said okay we're just going to push the source of the water from here over to hear but let's not go into the question of where did the water come from spilling these mountain valleys of Western Montana and this is what I'd I spent a couple of weeks in September going up into some of these following these valleys up into British Columbia and they're spectacular evidence and it's almost like

the American geologist stop at the at the 49th parallel they say well that's the Canadians preserve up there will let them there they've got their own theories we've got ours Interest really the Canadians are saying that we think that the water for these floods came from out here but they don't like that because you see one of the leading geologists who was saying that these floods came from from Canada is John Shaw who who basically came up there with his idea that drumlins which are these inverted both house shaped landforms are found by hundreds of thousands in regions where where glaciers were that they were formed not by the glaciers grinding over the landscape but they were actually formed by Massive subglacial flows of water and his critics of all been saying well here's the problem what's the source of your water therefore it wasn't water wasn't subglacial flood it's easy

<timemark seconds="4404" />

parallels. Harlen Bretz story very closely while he and his colleagues couldn't really come up with a plausible explanation for how you could form these massive subglacial reservoirs in fact what they call the living Stone Lake event required 84000 cubic kilometers of water and 84000 kilometres I can do it really quickly here we divide that by 30 36 that's about 2,300 cubic miles of water that's more than all of the Great Lakes combined vastly bigger than all of the Great Lakes combined it's probably every lake in North America combined and he said this one event required over 2,000 cubic miles of water well where did that water come from so he basically said there must have been a reservoir some how is it formed his critics and said that's impossible you couldn't form that much water under the ice she well what's happened now is the idea

<timemark seconds="4464" />

of a major Cosmic impact into the ice sheet is completely obviated the need for a subway from Reservoir because now we have a way of instantaneously melting enormous volumes of ice no longer a mystery where the water came from fully explained in this is being the missing piece of the puzzle until the climate research group began to identify this evidence to me that this is a source of controversy because we know that the Great Lakes were created by melting glaciers we also know that there's vast areas of North America that are flattened by these glaciers you know I'm a buddy of mine on my friend Doug lives in Cazenovia Wisconsin which is What's called the driftless area where the the glacier didn't go through I just was there in May is PewDiePie's make it's beautiful gorgeous skip Rolling Hills and it's just it wasn't wasn't crushed flat like other parts of North America were right so we know we know that those glaciers melted and they created the great lakes and the Great Lakes were from glaciers we know that writes in a style

<timemark seconds="4524" />

so why is all this confusing I just don't understand why they wouldn't just add that to it they're just going to accept the great the glaciers somehow or another in the last ten thousand years the glaciers just decided to stop smashing North America flat and melt and create these great Inland oceans are freshwater is this design I also been cut the modern world isn't designed not to panic the public not to say things like that are going to cause that are going to cause Panic you know you think people ready now I think people are ready for panic I think so is there is anybody debated you on this either one of you on this well you know I tried to tell him but not specifically on this I tried to do a debate with zahi hawass who's the guy who runs the Giza Pyramids are not a bad man total I mean very crazy event but it's a video of it online

<timemark seconds="4584" />

yeah yeah yeah and then a bed later on when they fit when he finally agreed to come back into the room cuz he was so angry with me walk out when he finally came back into the room he was off the question about Gobekli Tepe and just let your skeptic he didn't know anything about the back of head before he claimed not to know about this is supposed to be the world's most famous hockey do nothing about this incredible sight in their name one country but one point to make the rental was talking about the second event 11600 years ago with dealing with an with with an episode of cataclysm begins 12800 years ago and ends 11600 years ago both episodes accompanied by Massive floods and the 11600 years ago date I may have mentioned this last year it's in the it's in magicians of the Gods what's interesting about that is that is the exact date that Plato gives us for the destruction of the Lost Civilization of Atlantis like that's the only source we have for Atlantis it comes to us many people think it's all over the place

<timemark seconds="4644" />

what is not Atlantis comes to us from the Greek philosopher Plato who lived around 340 BC and he got the story from through his family line from his ancestors so long who had visited Egypt in 600 BC and that's all I was told of a great civilization that had existed on Earth that was the progenitor civilization of Egypt but that was destroyed in a terrible cataclysm and he asked of the cataclysm involving a gigantic flood and Atlantis was submerged beneath the waves and was never seen again and so solid said to the priest when did this happen and they said three to nine thousand years ago that was in 600 BC so that's 9600 BC that's 11600 years ago thats meltwater pulse 1B how could they know how could they have to start taking the stuff more seriously instead of sneering at it and skepta sizing it out of existence we need to leave a little bit of room for Extraordinary ideas possibly being right that's the main beef I have with the skeptic means that they want to throw

<timemark seconds="4704" />

baby out with the bathwater I want to add something to that end in the tomatoes meal Play-Doh discusses Atlantis into dialogues and ended to Emmaus he prefaces the story of Atlantis by recounting the myth of State. The myth of fate and is a very interesting story and basically what it is is Phaeton was The Offspring of Helios the Sun God who was raised didn't know who his father was his mother kept it a secret from him and then one day he was being taunted it's cool because all of his schoolmates had recounting the great Deeds of their fathers and everything so he went home just finally his mother said well actually your father is the the big granddaddy of them all Helios the sun god so Satan decides he's going to go and find his father and eventually does and he goes to some Celestial realm or his father is located in

<timemark seconds="4759" />

the way it is with the with the with this the Greek gods they have unlimited Powers except they also have certain restrictions for example if a god makes a promise he he or she cannot go back on it right so when Haley Oasys fate and his his lost son come he's Overjoyed he says I'm so happy to see you I will grant you any Boon you want and fate and says I want to drive the Chariot of the song I want to drive your chariot and Helios says well I meant anything you wanted except that you know so it goes back and forth and back and forth finally convinces his father let him let me do it his father says look you got to hang on to those reins Tight cuz those steeds are going to pull away from you

<timemark seconds="4803" />

he gets in there at the gates of the sun open it describes in the myth you can go you know where you can read eat at Hamilton or both answer any of the the great retellings of the Greek myths and they'll describe it in there it goes through the signs of the zodiac and it all of a sudden it careens off and heads down to earth and then it described his whole Litany of catastrophes just setting the Earth on fire and finally the Jupiter at the teaching of Poseidon who's afraid that the oceans are going to boil away get Zeus them out his his Mount Olympus and her what is Thunderbolt which knocks Peyton from the sky and he falls to Earth in in in falls into the river are a dontist which is a metaphor for the Milky Way and his sisters that he'll yachty's Dan weep over the death of their brother and their tears fall to Earth and caused the great flood Play-Doh then after referencing that myth he then says now this has

<timemark seconds="4863" />

form of a myth but it what it really represents is a declination or a declining of the bodies in spaced orbiting around the Earth in an eventual falling to Earth of one of those bodies and a conflagration of all things triggered by the fall of that body it's intriguing that he mentions the Zodiac because because the taurid meteor stream is so cold because it appears to come at us from the direction of the constellation of taurus the Zodiac constellation that's where those shooting stars amongst which are some very large objects that's that have hit us in the past and can hit us again in the future that's where they come from they come from that area of the sky appears that they're not actually coming from tourist it looks like that they come from that area of this guy who was witnessing in an according to the

<timemark seconds="4914" />

Victor Club in William Napier in those guys who are the British new catastrophes that have been doing all of this work for decades on the taurid meteor shower in cluded that you know in times past it was an extremely active shower and would have created some pretty darn impressive light shows even if it wasn't causing catastrophes down here below but what they what they have conjectured is that there might be times of multiple tunguska like impact bombardment when you know there could because there could be thousands of objects within the taurid meteor stream on the same scale as the tunguska object and that if if you go and you read the accounts the eyewitness accounts over and over again people are saying things like will it look like it was being disgorge from the Sun it looks like it was being born out of the sun right it look like a second sun in the sky like for a short. Of time the sun had a twin right well the summertime torrids are coming from their perihelion

<timemark seconds="4974" />

ants eat around the Sun so you like Green was saying they make an elliptical orbit out to Jupiter and back around the Sun in this stream write Hearth crosses that stream twice each year one time late June early July we crossed but at that point they're coming from the direction of the Sun so they're their arrival to Earth is going to be very difficult to see because they're coming from the direction of the sun right but that's exactly where on June 30th at Torrid meteor would be coming from and then also the fact that it's that the perfect date for the peak of the of the shower and the correct place in the sky to me is pretty convincing evidence it was most likely a remnant of that storage strength the other time that the Earth crosses his late October early November think we just passed out of it within the last week basically but if Pete's interesting ly coincidentally between like October 30th and November 4th or 5th so it speaking right around house

<timemark seconds="5034" />

meantime in fact they've been called a Halloween meteor send her some very intelligent I would sometimes they called the Halloween fireworks yeah but there's some very interesting work done by a researcher background the early 20th century named Grant Halliburton spent about 15 years researching the connections between ancient calendars and he concluded one thing very interesting was that a lot of these ancient calendars worth being synchronized by people's observations of the rise and fall of the Pleiades which is the shoulder of the bull the Pleiades comprises basically part of that constellation of the shoulder of the bolts and what he came up with was that in his research he discovered that many of these stories that were associated with this like the slaying of the celestial bull you know Gilgamesh and enkidu in the in the earliest known story date they fight they select your boat

<timemark seconds="5094" />

is many counterparts and variance of that in in in mythical stories and so what he then found out though was that in many cases the that that are modern Halloween actually goes back thousands of years to an ancient Day of the Dead that was observed all over the Earth at the same time every year even in the Southern Hemisphere and it usually revolve around the commemoration of the the culmination of the Pleiades which is when the Pleiades crosses the local Meridian another word reaches the Keystone of the Royal Arch so to speak up in the sky so if you got eye on Halloween now and you face the south in the northern hemisphere you will see the Pleiades right it at midnight at midnight they will be you think of that that the arch of the zodiac is being like a clock it's right there at midnight at midnight right well here's the interesting link is that in all of these missed what Halliburton

<timemark seconds="5154" />

cupboard over and over again was that the Day of the Dead ultimately went back to miss about of the destruction of the World by a great flood and or fire it's fascinating that it's all coming out of the constellation Taurus too and it's the celestial bull that they're fighting and he's ancient medicine them all these cultures around the world are celebrating the Day of the Dead of this exact same time is amazing stop and right now I science is closing its eyes to this I think it's fair to say with the taurid meteor stream which is a very big issue in this whole discussion that we are dealing with a Hidden Hand didn't even history it's something that is going to ultimately require us to re-explain almost everything that the Skeptics hate it they come Barrett because first of all it involves cataclysms and secondly it involves the possibility of losing a whole civilization from the record it's really it's really interesting when you look at the dates of the the this cluster this episode of bombardment

<timemark seconds="5214" />

between 12800 and 11600 years ago that's the. That just immediately precedes what mainstream Academia think of as the very beginnings of civilization they just never the maybe it's not even their fault it's this is so recent this science is so new that they've not had time to adapt to it but if they adapt to it and take this into account then suddenly what was an extraordinary and observed an impossible idea that there was a Lost Civilization 12,000 years ago becomes a very plausible and reasonable idea and then we start once we can once we take that on board then we can start opening our eyes to ocula Jacqueline Amelie's like the Great Sphinx like Baalbek like submerged ruins like Gobekli Tepe and begin to consider what does all this mean are we in fact a species with amnesia are we here forgetful of the truth about ourselves maybe that's why we so fucked up you know because we just actually don't know we made up a story

<timemark seconds="5274" />

play about where we came from and what we are only thing that plays a part and I also think that conservative skepticism is probably prudent when you're dealing with most scientific issues most things that come out that people are claiming and there's so many charlatans out there and crazy people that are claiming new discoveries but in some cases they examine these discoveries as long as they're far enough away from us or weird enough like this new planet that they believe their they have a 90 Planet 9 in there pretty sure there's something outside past the Kuiper belt and they think it's massive they think it's at least four times baby larger than the United States world than excuse me the world on the world ain't got nobody to the vet 10,000 years and that's interesting with comments because this huge massive object circulating in the outer solar system through the Kuiper belt which is a source of many of the comments that hit the earth is destabilizing comments from safe Obits and putting them into really dangerous Orbitz to come away correctly from wrong but

<timemark seconds="5334" />

what what is the source of all these near-earth objects did is it have anything to do with Earth 1 and Earth to does it have anything to do with the initial impact that created the Moon is that a cuz we were hit by another planet right through the formation of the earth and this is all scientifically established Astro scientists or astrophysicists rather and astronomers all agree on that right as I go back to that to that time but but, it's our another story because that coming in from the far reaches of outer space that coming that coming in from the Oort cloud and the click momentum just vast distances away their that voyagers that kind of messages from the distant reaches of the cosmos who come in an unpredictable way because they're all bits are destabilized by something like planet nine isn't there something called bode's law where are you we can measure the mass in the orbit of a certain planet and you can accurately depict with nexplanon is going to be in doesn't that fall apart somewhere between Mars and Jupiter this with the asteroid belt

<timemark seconds="5394" />

when was probably there I want one of the theory of the asteroid belt that it wasn't a planned of course there's a lot of opposition to that TV to you know your rights skepticism really has an important role to play it's it's very it's really it's really essential that we are skeptical and otherwise we'd all be following zecharia sitchin and waiting for the Anunnaki to land exactly what is December 21st 2012 we'd all be homeless for years later I have to say that's a skeptic called Michael Heiser who is done really an excellent job of of Thoroughly do you know debunking the bogus translations of Zechariah such a decision is wrong., very useful it's a very useful site so we hated him and loved him at the same time I was so sad I love the idea of the aliens come down and manipulating the monkeys make it has to mine gold the wonderful story but unfortunately it's a work of Science Fiction it's not awake of fact I knew him he was at fascinating man I once drove him from Stonehenge to London we had

<timemark seconds="5454" />

I had many conversations he was a deep and serious research it but I think he I think he got he got carried away with his own fat I also think that that fantasy became very lucrative and it also became a source of identity to him and I I followed him pretty closely as well I read the 12th Planet and I got really into his researches in this is in my early pot smoking days when I first start smoking pot so I was I was all-in I was all in and then as I got wiser and then as I got maybe not wiser just I started recognizing objectively why these things are so attractive the Fantastical is more attractive than the Practical and so something else in town and I'm here also decided that she did a lot of really good work he's very very very thorough research I just lost my track actually smoking too much dope where was I going what we were talking about all the different

<timemark seconds="5514" />

Fantastical in the Practical that there's this inclination to accept things that are fun and all that's what I was going to say is that when you start talkin about the Anunnaki those from Heaven to Earth candies fantastic creatures from thank you you brought my memory. Thing is that the level of technology that Zechariah a tribute to the Annunaki oblique Nephilim that that level of technology is the level of technology that we had in the 1970s when we were you know NASA was doing it stuff so it's not a technology from the 1970s that is projected out onto that is pretty but it's projected out that is projected out onto his theory of the past and it seems to me very unlikely that the Nephilim are the Annunaki would have had for 400,000 years which is what he's saying the same technology that NASA

<timemark seconds="5574" />

in the 1970s is much more likely that he's projecting that on to the doctor rather than that it's actually in Harrington the thought it was also some interesting ideas that he had that turned out to be idea that scientists at also propose about preserving our atmosphere by by levitating or by suspending reflective particles in our atmosphere and that that is something that the Anunnaki in his books were going to use gold for cuz gold has such unique properties which is why they use gold to play Things cuz you can take a little tiny piece of gold you can play this entire table goals are really spectacular piece of a I mean that it's just there's nothing like it right absolutely but unfortunately the translations of the text the translations of the texts are not translations of the texts they misrepresent the tax off of what he did was he took a nineteenth-century translation that he messaged it so that it would benefit his fit his argument about the pity so we need skeptic

<timemark seconds="5634" />

and they helped us to sift out the wheat from the chaff about but but occasionally what the Skeptics do with this drive to to criticize anything that's not mainstream occasionally what they do is they let go a really good idea which deserves investigation and which the human species could benefit from that's my feelings with this amazing species we've developed all this science why are we why are we so ready to let go of wonderful ideas what's so fascinating to me that because of what situation has been sort of criticized for people now ignore the stuff that's absolutely undeniable like the actual stone tablets themselves the clay tablets where you can see the depictions of the solar system somehow or another these people from 6000 + years ago had a detailed map of the solar system clear idea of the song what's this size in like a relatively correct order in the the planets in the right place like they somehow or another new that Jupiter was bigger than Mars they knew these things and so

<timemark seconds="5694" />

weird way and we don't know why we don't know how also the caduceus representing the the the double-helix of the DNA that's really fascinating concept 2 that the caduceus is used for medicine that's used to me it's just he had some really interesting points Zakaria did so it's kind of too bad there was so much crazy involved in that do when we're exploring the deep and hidden mysteries of the past is is to go to a lot of different sources go to a lot of dust just stick with the mainstream don't just stick with the alternative but try to try to bring it all together and then way that's what I try to do in my books except the skeptic still hate them yeah so hard because it's so it's so fun to go with the crazy story like the alien story is so compelling it's so fun. A compelling Story I mean if we found some sort of evidence of aliens it would be so utterly spectacular even if it was a simple alien like I've always said this

<timemark seconds="5754" />

jellyfish on the moon we would freak out but you know there's some really complex bizarre things at the bottom of our ocean that we never discovered just they're just not into the correct location for us to be excited and then the other the other issue we're getting slightly off offload toppik hair but the other issue of of entities that the bean counters with entities anybody who smoke DMT will know that as I have us as you have that will know that you do encounter entities in the DMT in the DMT stay and they do communicate with us and there's a lot of parallels with the ETS or the aliens as they described in Malta New for abduction accounts and Rick Strassman have you ever had the money to show you know Rick out sick supposed to be here a couple of times we're trying to reschedule it now but he had some pretty serious health issues now we had a date scheduled out but I love that guy had a chance to sit down with him a couple of times and talked to him and I but Christ you presented DMT The Spirit Molecule important to me because

<timemark seconds="5814" />

I remember when I did it I was so confused I mean it to me it was like the first my first DMT experience changed everything I thought about the world and I immediately didn't give a shit about aliens anymore like it was almost instantaneous like at 4 then I was like Roswell they've got the but what I am doing DMT was so spectacular the alienist The Pedestrian concept of something that looks like a person that has a bigger head and large eyes and high attack it would be if it was real it was nothing I mean literally not one millionth is interesting as what you absolutely can encounter when you do DMT that's the alien alien realm filled with alien intelligences hookah brand but we don't know that the rink is open to the possibility that we aren't dealing with areas of reality that are not normally accessible to our senses and the become accessible to our senses by retreating the receiver way back of the brain which is why

<timemark seconds="5874" />

He suggests DMT dozen I think I think that's very plausible in at the very least those who are interested in UFOs and aliens should be also investigating this line of inquiry can we can we use changes in Consciousness to understand the Majestic complexity of the universe in which we live and I think the answer is definitely yes and many of Rick's volunteers by paraphrase but they came back with reports that the entities who did counted them said we are so glad you discovered this technology now we can communicate with you much more easily you know it's fascinating so there's a technology for encountering other intelligence isn't against that this mechanistic simplistic alien mean that's going around now that they're bit like us but they came here in higher-tech than to piatek it's dull by comparison It Is. By comparison if you're interested anybody is at the book is amazing called DMT The Spirit Molecule and he has a new book that he's putting out about the prophecy

<timemark seconds="5934" />

chest of really really interesting guy but his is experiencing he did experiment city did where the first I think in many many decades to get approved by the government correct so he did everything above ground and he was above board he was dead because it because it was approved his room it was that he have to find some therapeutic benefit for DMT and he couldn't actually but that's not the point, I'm sure I see there are therapeutic benefits but that's not the point the point is here is a tool for investigating the mystery of consciousness of the mysterious nature of reality and I mean fuck me if we get five or six volunteers you haven't compared notes all coming back with met entities who said we're so happy you found this technology it's hard to explain that I was just to reduce it to brain activity that are so big in are ignored by mainstream culture this is one that's just like that you're talkin about an endogenous human chemical that not only is in us but is in thousands of different

how many different plants contain DMT ones like peas and you know it illegal to be the Jerusalem the professors from the University of Jerusalem I believe there's any Shannon believe that that's what a story of the burning bush in Moses's so that is Mimosa with the DMT and Syrian Rue with the monoamine oxidase inhibitor in other words it's it's Ayahuasca a middle-eastern alternative of it doing the same thing they like molecular possible in some way that the idea of the Burning Bush was them figuring out how to dry or extract DMT internet very likely possibly write producing God and it just so happens that this bushes at the acacia trees incredibly common super rich and DMT and all over the area and I should probably insert at this point that if you're at all familiar with the Masonic ritual you'll know that the acacia

place a central role that's why you want to 1% Mason characters inside of being a Freemason is a Freemason play know that my friend Duncan Trussell was performing at and for these two satanists and like 2003 and to this day is one of the levade Anton LaVey or Stanton LaVey whatever is his son and his son got married some young heatonist you know and they call themselves satanists and so Duncan performed at this wedding I went there to this day I get fucking tweets about being a Satanist so I can't join your little club pal Mason's I need to confess here. You didn't realize this but I secretly initiated you oh my God

<timemark seconds="6114" />

how do you spell initiate somebody can you do that for me if you know the people even you Joe I don't think so I met a couple of Mason's they're very cool most Masons don't really understand the Corpus of symbolism ditz that they're sitting on top of I got to say not to get off on the Freemasons but since there's a mass of symbolism and that's the whole that's that's the thing that they are custodians of and most of them don't have a clue what it means but they're doing an important job by preserving is Corpus of symbolism through the through the layout of the lodge the the meaning of every component in the lodge because it's a purely astronomical allegory and then you have the Masonic carpets and that's where you have the whole story if the comet the flood hits all their The Acacia plant it's all there but it's it's all

<timemark seconds="6174" />

Integra part of how Washington DC was designed is that true there's a bunch of videos we can watch it with a certain described how the layout you know is in some way some sort of sacred geometry I know what it what is based on the Freemasons were massively involved in the construction of Washington many great cities in England has got the major Masonic architect so is it like people like me like my initial purchase I hear something like the Masons like a fucking dudes in a call to get out of here and leave me alone like we we assume that all groups of people that follow anything and somehow another wacky masons in my opinion that largely a drinking Club for Men mainly that's what it is that you can make special arrangements to bring women into giving a talk in a large I've given talks in two or three large is Vanoss to do so then they make a special ceremony to allow my wife Santa to come

cuz I won't go anywhere without something so women can women can go in but then there are more there are others within masonry who are pursuing deeply esoteric interest in exploring the best reason you can have incredible conversations and Festival is just another another group of people who you know are doing a doing nothing is not for me I wouldn't join I don't have I would lose I think if I join Freemasonry it would weaken me as an authorized I think I may I think I'm I'm better able to comment on these things by not being a member of any such grits interesting why do you think that well because I think I have to remain open to all possibilities and if I if I if I commit myself to a particular line I don't commit myself to a particular religion I don't commit myself to a particular men's club either I just which is what makes me is I think if I commit that down a bit then ultimately I would become a spokesperson for that and I don't want to be that that makes a lot of sense considering your occupation and how important being open-minded has been to your life but the title is that accept it absolutely without it how could you have ever done Fingerprints of the Gods I could not

I mean the the thing the initial thing where you were to tell me about Ethiopia that place where they believe that the the Ark of the Covenant it lays which is one of the most bizarre ideas ever and that was my first book on historical mystery was the sign in the ceiling but I've always imagined you as a young guy forced to sort of reconcile with this bizarre piece of evidence of got these old men that have cataracts in their eyes like the round radiation sides and no one's allowed to go inside and see this thing and they claim they have the Ark of the Covenant in there in like what the fuck is in there I read Fingerprints of the Gods it was to me it was one of those books I just couldn't put down was so mind-blowing in this again was in the heart of my the F ucking anything printed in 1995

<timemark seconds="6354" />

I'm out in 20 in in 2015 and I would say in that time the end of the other day when I made the case for A Lost Civilization and a global cataclysm in Fingerprints of the Gods I can't begin to account for the amount of hostility and anger and rage that I generated in the academic invented the idea was considered to be absolutely absurd 20 years later with magicians of the Gods it's not so upset anymore the evidence is mounting we have incredible evidence now for a global cataclysm in exactly the. That counts between 12811 thousand six hundred years ago and we have sites like Gobekli Tepe would have a redefinition of the Sphinx the whole area is just about to explode in in in in the future we are on the edge I believe off of a paradigm shift in this comment material is Central to it but I really appreciate about your courage is that you've also had the courage to admit when you've made mistakes you're you're not you don't in any way pretend to be some sort of a bear of secret knowledge no one else was that an absolute

<timemark seconds="6474" />

that's just that no one's doing that like this is but it's not mainstream what's more mainstream than being number one on the iTunes podcast listener of which he is all the time what is more mainstream that he must be getting millions of downloads it's part of the big changes taking place in our society that the old structures are being overthrown that being thrown away it's very uncomfortable time it's a very uncertain time is a very exciting time because we can build out of this something something amazing in the future the internet's had a huge part to play in that the fact that people can communicate with one another all around the world since I was late, but maybe two or two to three years ago I've been getting contacted by I mean professionals from around the world I've got probably a dozen major what's a geologist who want to know more about an interest in you said earlier about debating you know I'm always looking for somebody to debate about Brian because I have questions and I'm thinking maybe somebody even somebody

disagree with me on something good still help me answer some of the rides to write but I tried to associate as much as possible and hang out with Professionals in the field and of course what I discover is that a lot of them are working in these things part-time almost clandestinely without making it part of their you know if I go on a field trip of geologists into the the flood lands none of them are really working on it full-time it's all part time you know they're working for the government to working for the oil companies or exploration mineral exploration whatever they're doing his research into geological catastrophes on their own time right but recently just last summer I got invited to actually present some of my research to the Atlanta Geological Society which is the largest Society of professional geologist in the Southeast so I jumped at the chance rather than you know and so I presented hoping that I would get challenge that somebody would say wait

<timemark seconds="6594" />

second there's a flaw in your thinking you didn't happen so did you make friends with some of these mainstream geologist took a trip for spent 10 10 days back out in the flood light on

<timemark seconds="6611" />

I told you I was just with me on that trip so yeah I'm getting to know more and more people who are working as well you know I majored in geology and come so I still am in touch regularly with the head of the geology Department I see her pretty much on a regular basis and have been keeping her apprised of some of my stuff and she has off offered to sponsor me at whatever point I think that I can pull it together is a dissertation but we'll see how that goes I mean I might have ejected was to to learn geology not to become a professional geologist I wasn't interested in working for the government or working for you know if the energy industry I had geological questions and that's why I major in geology and he walk the walk and in my opinion you know more about this stuff than 10 fully PhD geology so what what's what's fascinating to me about all this is that I think what you've done is been very measured you know everything you back up with facts and photographs and

<timemark seconds="6671" />

descriptions and disclaimers you know when you when you say well it's it is possible you will go down other various past your not dogmatic about these ideas but you've spent so much time going over this I don't know if there's another if there's a commensurate guy in mainstream archaeology that has been public about it the way you have been because of their is I feel like we probably would have heard about him your podcast have been the ones that we've done they've been seen by millions of people they didn't listen to buy millions of people mean that the information is getting out there and make a real difference you're always going to have the the guys like I think Michael Shermer is very important and not criticizing to put that knee-jerk reaction to do something to Mark something or put down something that's not mainstream like one of his tweets he said you know what Archaeology with evidence is any wrote archaeology like why would you even tweet that this is me making he sent like that someone is not paying attention to you work that makes it all you do is focus on

<timemark seconds="6731" />

the lady doth protest too much why does he need to say that it's got the evidence you know it's like saying fair and balanced dinner at you with this entire book is based on photographic evidence and all the other various pieces of evidence I mean that you're at these are actual real sites that you can look at I'm drawing inferences from them that they don't like that's the thing Robert schoch and guys like him or so important to have the courage to Boston University Professor rhapsodize acreage to look at the stones and say this is the product of water Rosie Stone Tunes cute us to rub it shocked as a career academic geologist who's taking that risk and put himself out there and follow the evidence where it leads another one is Danny Hillman not to watch Archer in Indonesia who's being responsible for the investigation of this extraordinary

<timemark seconds="6791" />

Grandpa. Where I work has been stopped since 2014 again he's a highly credentialed geologist is Indonesia's leading expert in megathrust earthquakes but he's been looking at our Guild you bringing his geological expertise to that so that things are changing we are finding we are finding academic so willing to engage and willing to to discuss I I got into a very interesting and email correspondence with a guy called Daniel Lohman at balbec but from the gym and archaeological Institute who's an architect and an archaeologist and he was very civil with me and I he answered my question we went into it in depth we have a long debate that's very refreshing that kind of thing wasn't happening 20 years ago yeah that is very refreshing now what about those pyramids in Bosnia has that been what is what is the deal with that those things I've been there I know some of us with magic personally simos the guy who's who's promoted the sites I like some very much I must say when I'm in his Aura I'm extremely

<timemark seconds="6851" />

but when I when I look rationally at the at the Sokol pyramids I don't think they pyramids I think the hills I did spend with Sam showing me around I just spent three days in Bosnia looking at the Sokol pyramid of the Sun the Pyramid of the Moon. I love pyramid and so on and so forth I do see that a tourist industry has built up around this and it's a fabulously beautiful intriguing site in the massive beautiful mountainous place but they are Hills they are not pyramid impression is given that there are tunnels passageways inside the pyramids that's not true the passageways are about to 2 and 1/2 kilometer is a way that very low-tech I I just don't I just don't see it and for that reason I did not cover the Bosnian pyramids in The Magicians of the Gods I'm not going to say they're not pyramids I'm not going to write a book saying that the wrong but I didn't excite me enough to justify devoting a chapter to them is much more exciting and important archaeological discoveries that are being made like go back to Tempe which need more space

<timemark seconds="6911" />

and there's some there's some pyramid-like structures or Hills in China as well right as the thousands of pyramids in China Sea and the province of CRM is just a moment you land that if you're a craft using pyramids everywhere I'll be the only thing that that there are certainly hundreds and hundreds of them distributed across Fields Vanishing off into the distance in all in all directions they Pinterest and used as agriculture the local farmers grow grow crops on them I went there with Chinese archaeologist they haven't excavated a single one know why not they said we don't have this was needed 10 years ago I was there they said they probably got the money now but they said then they didn't have the money they said we're an old country we don't mind if we wait 200 years to get to grips with this is Christ in his tomb of the first emperor is pontiff this continent is also a pyramid it is also nothing excavated the Terracotta Army around it has been found that Terracotta Army resume

<timemark seconds="6971" />

it was on display somewhere wasn't it where you can go and see it lie I did so want to see that thing I'd want to look at those things what it would have bizarre concept now these pyramids so this one. This this Emperor was buried in that had the Terracotta Army was that a pyramid as well it is. It is absolutely is a man-made pyramid the Terracotta Army was buried around its edges not in the pyramid itself so the Army was there to protect him yeah I can protect his soul into the Afterlife seems to be in the sense of being the idea and then there's of Mythology that's come down that they that within the pyramid is a lake of mercury that there are mechanical devices in that which will fire arrows at you if you go in that there's a whole story about how how intensely protected it is on up to the states not being excavated that's so crazy how could someone leave that alone and you know even major archaeological sites like tiahuanaco in Bolivia for example you find the only about 2% of the site has been excavated I don't know

<timemark seconds="7031" />

how we can draw inferences about the whole site from from a tiny little pregnant stretching like that and that's the that's the problem I think with archaeology and it's why we have to you don't consider another way we're looking at an image of the Terracotta Army now in front of this pyramid and it is spectacular now that I think about it I don't think that was on display anywhere I think maybe they had a couple of them brought some of them may catch the British museum they were numbered museums but it's so much bigger than I thought it was I mean there's I mean how many there's thousands of thousands of these terracotta figures what is it still okay so they just sort of shape the ground they just dug around extensive stone blocks is not my sister that's why they can grow crops on the sides of some of these pyramid weird so they wouldn't build these giant mounds of dirt and then dig holes in him and support him

<timemark seconds="7091" />

celebrity created the interior Subterranean as they were building the whole thing over it and they just stacked dirt on top of it now wow what a weird way to make a house and then we have to consider this with you know with with Aki logical side so we'll all around the world is that any site may actually not be the product of just one culture but may have been reworked and worked over and used by many different cultures over. Stunning to me I found out about this because of a friend of John Anthony West was here with him he showed me he lives in China new show me some video of it and I was like how do I not know about this I had no idea there was this many of them all so here's one that's exposed was this controversial ancient pyramids of China that one looks expose it's not one thing about China that we just don't have a clue

<timemark seconds="7143" />

when we when we think about it the the age and scale of things were so silly we've only been around since suno 1776 is when the country was established it's not really that long ago you deal with China you dealing with literally thousands of years of civilization all rising and falling and taking place in adapting and growing on this one area but still in our prize in a lot of ways it's kind of behind right I mean they're behind environmentally there behind when it comes to Human Rights consider this the Portuguese in the late 1400 have rounded the Cape of Good Hope invented the Indian Ocean in that little ships they vented the Indian Ocean and they actually establish a huge Empire that go to Monica they go all over the place okay the seas are open to them if they had come 40 years earlier they would have been counted the Chinese treasure ships ships that were 50 times larger than the little Caravan

<timemark seconds="7203" />

what's that that Portuguese where we're sailing in Boston you're what the Chinese did at that time they went through a period where they felt they just wanted to give gifts to people and they put together these huge fleets caring incredibly precious gift silks and Ceramics and they took them all around the Indian Ocean and they just gave them to people so it's so off the coast of East Africa and then he suffer you can find remains of this pottery from this episode and Vanna Chinese emperor came along

<timemark seconds="7229" />

any close the doors on the boats shut everything down and didn't let anybody speak to China for 200 years what a dick to turn in a lot of a motive in that they were concerned that the ancient culture was going to get contaminated by too much contact with cultures from other places and that was a factor in it constant desire to maintain the current situation human do we have to say it's some kind of some kind of human nature yeah for sure I'd love to see some of these images of let's let's have a look at it you got that was Chinese parents are blowing my mind I blow my mind as well

<timemark seconds="7289" />

I just say it's incredible how many of them there are and how unexplained it all isn't as I gain it feeds into my general point is we don't remember I parked what are we looking at here we pause so I can talk about what we're looking at you look at this one that way to hit the mic right in front of you okay this is the beginning we're looking at a place in Western Montana called Camas Prairie you see some hills in the foreground and you see a basin in the background right okay right here on top of this hill and down on the side your you see that there are some coring operations Ozark or gravel because everything you're looking at your this whole landscape between the hills are these large masses of gravel trillions of tons of gravel

<timemark seconds="7335" />

that what we're going to do is going to start sweeping around is the video plays and you're going to load us down here a series of ripples

<timemark seconds="7344" />

oh okay I see that okay and I'm going to have Jamie pause in a second but let's keep coming around you start seeing the ripples on the landscape

<timemark seconds="7352" />

let's pause right there right there let's pause no I wish I had a pointer but if you look up you're going to see a flat piece of land like a tongue coming out round yellow Jamie's

<timemark seconds="7369" />

right here

<timemark seconds="7371" />

that's it get you a laser that's a Delta that's a Delta you know what a Delta is

<timemark seconds="7378" />

you ever heard of a Delta it's when a river comes into a body of water and it's carrying sediment and because the river is moving along swiftly it's carrying the sediment but would it comes into the standing body of water it slows down and it drops its sediment it built a Delta the whole city of Portland for example is built on the giant Delta right New Orleans is built on a Delta right okay so we're seniors at Delta and then in front of it we're seeing rippled landscape

<timemark seconds="7408" />

let's keep coming around Jamie and some food landscape that looks exactly like the beach looks in the scale of hundreds of feet here again Lord of Delta nursing Farmhouse you see The Farmhouse there. Those ripples are the tallest ones are about the height of a 5-story building

<timemark seconds="7444" />

how bizarre keep the okay let's keep keep sweet swinging around here stop this for second if you don't mind. So these things they're the size of a five-story building what is that like 750 feet okay so that's those are 50 ft high and how much water will get to that let's see let's see the rest of it and these are just dirt right there if you dig into one what you're going to find is there there are massive okay let's pause again oh look at this this is crazy this is totally crazy this is one of the craziest things you'll ever see this this these ripples the repeated ripples in an area where there's nothing else like it this is the Fingerprints of the flood that's what it is working someone look at this how does someone look at this in real you know this right now that's what we're looking at this is this video well my colleague Brad young did this with his drone

<timemark seconds="7503" />

and I think he's got it on the website geocosmic Rex is being played in the YouTube video right now okay alright so the YouTube people cool with it if you're listening on iTunes find it but it's worth looking at is what my point this is this is mindblowing shit and I think I think you made the crucial Point Joe which is which is that we can understand what this is because we can see it on any Beach we can see how water flows receding across a Sandy medium will produce ripples but here there on this unbelievable scale with a hundreds of feet long and 50 feet high where they do all houses and then lying all across a map to what that tells us is that a huge water flow went across this plain and did this you will see it from this perspective you get a chance to look at it this way if you really get a better sense of what it is if you are on the ground there you'd probably say all look at all the Hills Hunt to say

<timemark seconds="7563" />

do that day it was overcast so you don't quite get the effect like you do when you got when it low Sun angle really helps you to see what the what what's going on in the landscape can I ask you is there a dispute to this is there a no no nobody disputes it from a flood not anymore wow know and those same people would still not buy into the notion that there was this one humongous look okay so they they think it into the cumulative effect but that this was all created or water supposed to actually represent the draining of Lake Missouri from a number of different reasons that this is the feeling of hatred I have a friend of mine who his friend lives in Montana and they found a dinosaur on his Ranch oh wow really recently the Great Western Inland Sea all that at that area there was that mean this is a

<timemark seconds="7623" />

crazy place at one point in time if it is I'll give it a different way the water here Joe that did this the way to visualize this is to get in begin to think or tsunami you have to think tsunami because the grind tsunami is the closest scale of water flow that we've experienced in in modern times no River flood hit his even approach no no flooding any flood plain nothing we can put into perspective the closest the closest we can get to it as this is a tsunami but even are you got a picture of the tsunamis that we've experienced in the last decade-and-a-half you know in in Indonesian Japan when they made landfall those tsunamis were roughly between 20 and 50 ft depending on where you were relative to the oncoming wave and how far distance you were from it hear what you have to visualize is a tsunami sweeping over the land that's over a thousand feet deep

<timemark seconds="7681" />

that's that's what happened here and we know that because we can trace the high-water marks on the hillsides are clearly let the high-water marks are clearly asked you into the into the hillsides so we now know based upon the study of the ripples in the water here was moving down it's filling this base and it's rushing in a great tsunami from the north of freshwater meltwater coming off the ice sheet and it's sweeping down over this land at probably two or three hundred million cubic feet per second which isn't inconceivable amount of water it sits many times in excess of every river flow at on Earth flowing today all at once it's it's beyond that many times 10 or 20 times be on that trip your things about water is at water in a in itself is kind of fractal in some sort of a weird way when you look at the the actual molecules of water tunnels like we don't do we don't distinguish it is being a fractal thing cuz we see it is like this moving flow

<timemark seconds="7741" />

if you're looking at the actual molecules of water the cup of water with you that you dip your fingers in which is seemingly completely innocuous and becomes this massive element of change when the volume is 1000 feet high and is rolling over with massive amounts of weight behind it it's that same stuff that it's actually causing seismic responses in walls but what's fascinating to me is that we don't have we we don't have a scale like in our minds as a reference like the difference between that little cup and these gigantic waves that you see that Surfers travel by jet ski to get to you know what the off of believe it's Mexico racinos massive ways they go way out miles out to get to these crazy waves and ride him in there like 60 70 feet high

<timemark seconds="7801" />

I guess that's the comparison almost like a glass of water to those waves and then that to this scales out its scales up its scales up and at a certain point it can change the whole story of civilization Almost Doesn't compute much as you can intellectualize it but it's almost not Computing one of these flood flows here is three orders of magnitude greater than the largest measured modern flood in other words over a thousand times greater in terms of peak discharge or volume you would have to scale up at least a thousand times greater than any modern measured to get to the smallest really of these flows here cuz this is this is just one one place one Locale of on five states where you can trace that the literally that the ocean and freshwater sweeping across the entire Pacific Northwest

<timemark seconds="7856" />

pretty much washing away anything that was there it's almost like we have a defense mechanism built in will we ignore how vulnerable we really are like we put it in a bee that's one of the reasons why people are so reluctant to really go deep into studying asteroidal impacts I think work or even to pay attention to this stuff like that this could happen and this is I mean the result of the Comet impacts on the on the icecap this is this is the this is why I feel that the research in this field is so vital organ right there yeah the beach but it's a beach for giant monsters you can see in this here that you've actually got three massive currents converging here do you see that you've got a massive current coming in that would be from the west and then we're standing we would be standing looking down current Course Des

<timemark seconds="7916" />

the Drone I'm guessing hears about 200 feet in elevation so the top of the water was another 8 to 900 ft Above This perspective right here and it's moving very very fast and it's sweeping down into a river valley that's down in those mountains you see in the distance and from there it's being carried down in joining up other equally as large floods coming in from other valleys and all of this is happening at once and it's covering five states basically and that's just one region that's being affected by this sudden catastrophic melting of the ice sheets they are dealing with the largest flood that ever occurred on Earth it's a simple of you. This is insane means it's a hundred years ago and it's story has yet to be fully told isn't it possible there was something larger before like the 65 million years ago one that hit the Yucatan like what you know what kind of an impact

<timemark seconds="7976" />

well it actually would have because if it if that's what they hear that was a single Lodge up to about 6 miles wide that was that was a much more devastating impact on the impacts of 12800 years ago but never the last those impacts of 12800 years ago we're really really bad and they can stuff like they sent anything that was in the way of this of these massive flows of water would have been rubbed completely from the story when you understand the extent of this the scale of this phenomena in the severity beat the uncut inconceivable severity of this in the aftermath of an event like this what would remain of a of a city of Village refrigerator

<timemark seconds="8036" />

find like an old refrigerator or car up on blocks in someone's backyard in the South and it seems the 1970s in the rot has gotten into frame that they just going to eat it up eat it up just a couple of decades what's going to be like in a couple thousand years we should not be surprised about how little we really know about our past is also a game that we had to send it here is this what we teach in schools this is what our friends in the media report this is the fat it's not the fact we know nothing it's that there's been so much lost so many missing pieces of the puzzle that we are in a desperately trying to stitch together and it's important I think that we actually do get some clarity on events like this because we still live on this planet and we have kids and we have a future and we want to help you want to hopefully we want to buy those big boys comes our way I come down to this which is the which is that we are not dealing with gloom and doom in the end of the world with dealing with

<timemark seconds="8096" />

problem that Humanity should be confronting we should not be sticking our heads in the sand we should be confronting this problem and that's why I support the work of the committee research group because they are the only people right now who are confronting this problem and really getting to grips with it we should all confront I mean we should absolutely all support them and confront it because this if something like this can happen once what's it would really make sense is how many stories of floods there are in ancient times and how many parallels though are there are and how many they're off from North America dozens and dozens the Indian artist who spent 30 years or so pre-civil War I think maybe a decade after the Civil War painting Indians of different tribes and he wrote a book called last ramble some of the North American Indians very very interesting book but what really is interesting to me when I read the book years and years ago was his final conclusion of the book he says after all of these different customs and traditions have been handed down amongst these tribes

<timemark seconds="8157" />

they all have one thing in common they all have a memory or a story of a gigantic world-destroying slide and he and he has concluded tribes down into Central America that he visited I believe the Americas are the repository that then the Native American peoples who have been subjected to so much destruction over the years they in that mythology their Traditions that memories they keep more of this than almost anybody else it's through three it's really tragic what has happened in the Americas from the time of the Spanish Conquest the deliberate destruction of knowledge that the terrible horrendous abuse is the Native American people suffered they are our wisdom Keepers they are the people who pumps down the oral tradition done and remember the past so not only do we have catechism wiping the human memory but we are cells actively get involved in the human memory and wipe it we rub it out the burning of the Maya codices by the Spanish prize thousands and God knows what was in those documents now you know we might have had a whole other story

<timemark seconds="8217" />

ourselves if we could have had access to those but instead where this destructive cannibalistic species that just goes in the smashes everything to bits is a weird impulse that human beings have is when they move into an area to take over 20 things you like to do is destroy their icons destroy everything that's going on with Isis and all these are ancient Buddhist thousand plus year old beautiful sculptures absolute net blowing them up here and India yelling praise God while they're doing it's really very bizarre it's a very bizarre inclination that we have it so it's almost like we don't want people to know you know it's is a bizarre almost human instinct to wipe out the past and just to constantly keep moving forward please baby surprise memory is exactly the thought they had because I think that's the one way one of those areas were velikovsky finally really nailed it was you Mankind in Amnesia that somehow we carry this the Trump cuz

<timemark seconds="8277" />

to begin to get to get a hand on you get to get the picture of these events as they occurred and did occur and what have been experienced by our ancestors you got understand what would it be like to see your entire completely obliterated Starting Over Again from basically a bear in mud field you know because you know a major cultural collapse if you had to guess what percentage of the population of human beings just as obviously just a gas but how many do you think were wiped out

<timemark seconds="8314" />

half of them three quarters of them I don't think that would be unrealistic know it doesn't seem like it would be in if it was that number and those people that's enough for people to survive and if it was that number or what it's strange fucking mythical is in the world today I will. We have an advanced civilization

<timemark seconds="8338" />

America Germany industrialize technological countries and we have coexisting with them in South America in the Libyan Desert we have fun together is so they the notion that hunter-gatherer is and an advanced civilization might coexist right in the same epic of History should not be strange to us because we're doing that today and that's what I would suggest happened before 12800 years ago before the cataclysm of 12800 years ago that that was a fairly Advanced civilization that was capable of mapping and exploring the world creating gigantic works of architecture at 8 coexisted with hunter-gatherers and who were the ones who survived the cataclysm the answer is the ones who survived the cataclysm where the hunter-gatherer is not the sophisticated people's a few of them survive then they been settled among the hunter-gatherers and try to transfer some of that Knowledge and Skills to them and it's the same today if we if we were to have

<timemark seconds="8398" />

repeat of the younger dryas cataclysm today I don't think that people from Los Angeles or London would be among the leading survivors I think the survivors would be people like the hunter-gatherers of the Amazon rainforest cuz they're in the business of surviving that's what they do it's not a mystery to them it's not even a problem they do it they do it all the time they would they would carry the human story forward and ten thousand years from now their descendants would be telling a myth about how there was once a great civilization on this planet so Advanced that they could even go to the Moon they could fly around the planet they could speak to one another on other sides of the Earth but they did something wrong they they fell out of harmony with the universe they ceased to wear their prosperity with moderation that's actually a line from Plato about to Atlantis wow and the universe slap them down so that would be a differential survival rate those who were at the I would say that those who are more technologically advanced are less likely to survive

<timemark seconds="8458" />

because they depend on it complex interrelated network of skills and any individual on his or her own most of them but you are different joke cuz you do know how to survive but a lot of people don't know how to say barely know how to survive. We haven't got a clue let me fuck everybody out there and shoot animals to stay alive good fucking luck you're you're probably screwed if you have a rifle even if you have a rifle you're probably screwed if you have a bow and arrow you going to fucking starve to death right it's an extremely difficult yes to get clothes you know and yet hunter-gatherers but thousands and thousands of years have succeeded in doing that like that. The Bushmen of the Kalahari I think there was less humans and more animals right thing that's also part of the rub we're dealing with is it one of those terrible things we've done is taking these Giants watts of land and made them entirely and habitable for wildlife

<timemark seconds="8518" />

I get you when you how many people grow food in the city did what is the percentage even one-tenth of 1% of people in the city grow their own food probably not going anywhere no Wildlife exist other than predatory species are coyotes and Ravens things like that than take and then you you go out from there and then you have these vast Farmland the only benefit of the vast farm lands is the amount of deer that exists now is greatly more than when Columbus landed but it's because they've almost become an agricultural animals almost like they're almost a domesticated animals there a free Wild domesticated animal I have a friend who has a farm in Iowa and when you go there it's it's very strange because he's got these wild giant 300-pound Forest horse running around his backyard I mean there's your fucking everywhere it is all these giant deer and when we were there it's What's called the rut so all these leave their very horny so the big box of usually hide they show themselves

<timemark seconds="8578" />

this is a crazy place like there's all these wild animals that exist along with people and even in a game Ridge place like that it's incredibly difficult to get the one you have your own vegetables so let's imagine the situation where all the resources of our cities older all the authorities all the infrastructure are gone most of us are fuct I would say radically I would say that, Civilization which app is so strong is actually very very fragile extremely just a little push it's like when you look out the window and you like wow that's the outside know that's a piece of glass you're outside it's not that piece of glass in your outside you like the effortless it is we just seems impenetrable because you know you pull the shades tied and you set your alarm clock Sleep you're sleeping next to Glass hilarious you feel confident you're sleeping next to a piece of fucking glass incredible complacency in an hour against

<timemark seconds="8638" />

one story that where the bestest ever, and that's a danger at mythologically that is a very dangerous place to be when you start imagining yourself as the Apex on the Pinnacle of everything that's precisely when the universe remind you that you are not that at all yeah it's a very weird existence that we have a we just sort of look at how things are right now and we can't imagine things being any different no matter what ways was it's the people that have to come to the realization that they've been injured when someone breaks their leg and all said it just doesn't compute like how come I can't walk anymore you reality is now shifted and this reality that we have here with this fairly healthy Earth could shift at any moment that the Yellowstone volcano is the one that's been freaking me out the most over the last few years another big issue

<timemark seconds="8689" />

an interesting parallel would be if we look at small or what happens in smaller catastrophes like we've seen today when we look at the at 4 example when Katrina hit and hit New Orleans right it was almost as if the human species separated into two subspecies you had one group of people that Rose to the occasion and did heroic things they organized and they save people spontaneously you know because the government was conspicuously absent for five days the first five days of the Katrina disaster in here you had a major flooding of New Orleans in and you had people spontaneously organizing and Performing these heroic actions of of saving their fellow man and and doing just stupendous thing superhero types of things but then you had another segment of the population that just went completely barbaric and you had Mass rapes and Spilled smashing of businesses and looting and in in

people running in Wild complete unrestrained gangs just an inn just committing violent acts it random so in America the richest country on Earth did not manage that price as well, and it was very little prices by comparison with what we took in the membrane Kanye West on TV George Bush does not like black people I don't remember that but yeah I think it was Sunday for George Bush flew over in Air Force One in and looked out the window when you get out of events sure prepared we have to extrapolate from that and you go back and you know I often time is a thought exercise think how how would we respond if we knew that there was a high probability of a younger dryas type of ant or series of events in pending in our future what would you do start

Haley time I do not going to be able to shoot a rocket up there Chandos go hard go hard to the end then we can do something then we can do some stuff the real scary thing is there's two scary things one if you survived is it like a fuck you know if you if you really did survive and everybody else was jacked and also need dealing with some Mad Max type reality or people are starving to death and then very desperate and they become almost like animals that's entirely and inside the realm of possibility terrifying possibility is that you leave the future of civilization up to those other people

<timemark seconds="8852" />

cuz it's a Survivor and they have kids and their kids survive and somehow or another somewhere along the line we get better and better understanding our place here which is what I think has happened and all it would take is one I mean this is as much as people are complaining right now as much as the dishes riots in the streets because it work excuse me protest in the street with some rides apparently but overall the president-elect what this time is it represents the greatest time in history when it comes to safety when it comes to knowledge access-to-information way we understand each other I don't think it's ever been better as far as long as we know we have everything else there's that there's incredible potential in modern civilization but the problem is that this is a very rigid mind control the way that our society's work is its turning people into drones people people brought up to believe that their only purpose in existence is production and consumption that the people forced to fit into a that's out of narrow place in the Machine mask

<timemark seconds="8912" />

idea beaming you the messages I test out us all the time even that concept of democracy is observed when you don't when you don't have complete transparency when there are secrets when things are hidden how can the people vote you know within 48 with clear my lettuce a lot is being hidden from them that's not democracy demand democracy isn't that investing in mind control most unfortunate develop well I wonder how long it's going to take before the rigid mine sets that are in place right now and this idea of this resistance to change that we were talking about when it comes to science when it comes to accepting this asteroid impact Theory and I think that exist in politics I think it exists in religion I think it exists socially the way we approach relationships and friendships and just all of it is evolving in front of our eyes I was watching a movie last night not another teenage movie so it is there was called and I was live-tweeting it so smoking pot and writing and sometimes

<timemark seconds="8972" />

like to have the TV on and not listen to it just it just sometimes I like to see some things when just writing things sometimes I know that last night I chose to do it that way and I just got so enamored in this weird movie from 2001 this is a the movie felt like a time machine is like I was watching this culture that does not exist anymore it's one of those like a teenager movies were like in college and they're drinking and there's a lot of when naked women and really racist sexist humor and its really crude and Goofy and stupid and I'm like this is so bizarre because they just doesn't exist anymore in this kind of film. This is like this like Al Jolson with black face on or something and in a way it's like a cultural time machine like you get to go and for a brief moment see like this, did somebody concocted in 2001 which seemed so recent but it's such a big in that film you get evidence of this weird culture

<timemark seconds="9032" />

change our sins that weird massive cultural change its happened with as far as where we're allowed to joke around about things in his Embrace of shit in that movie like racist and sexist shit and violence like men punching him in the face and shit like that you just can't really doing a comedy today and that's when 15 years ago and what what is it going to be like if we can avoid getting hit by a rock blowing ourselves up Yellowstone blowing up in our face if we can keep going I think we're on a great path I think our this is where I don't think about the president elect and I think we're on a grape path it's a hazardous post it pop with it so it's a pain where the future is not at all certain but but humanity is at one of those

<timemark seconds="9073" />

moments mommy has Crossroads where you kind of stand on the edge of an abyss and then you don't quite know what lies ahead and we can take a really great path out of this or we can take a really horrible Python and the I think the key issue is with the we do actually have a choice it doesn't have to be that way I see a lot of positive a lot of positive out there out there in the world I do think people are waking up I think they are questioning all structures that refusing to put up with the bullshit any longer more and more people are doing that's happening in the realm of politics is happening in the realm of dealing with the big corporations is happening in the realm of investigating the past we just not going to be told what to think anymore that's encouraging but then on the other side there are huge efforts being put precisely into making people think in certain ways whether it's the advertising industry whether it's political messages and so we have to be aware of that and it could go it could go down the Drone pause I mean like the be the Beehive pump which would be why even bother to be human if your Society is turning you into a

<timemark seconds="9133" />

Wicked drone in the end of a beehive life existence or it could that go down and expansion of consciousness in the end and the realization of the incredible beautiful potential of the human race that's where it's going to take time out to Mystic that's beautiful to hear because this is a time I was watching the John Oliver show it's a great show on HBO very funny guy in the end is very left-wing leaning and as it sure would they had this fuck 2016 thing where they were just naming off all the horrible things that happened in 2016 they like and then just saying goodbye to this terrible year and like a good shit happened to CR2 there's a lot of fantastic discoveries a lot of interesting observations a lot of people learned a lot of things in 2016 as well and I think that I'm quite a number of American states have made cannabis legal yes that's I think you know there's a huge development it's also a big it's going to be a big factor in our cultural revolution it really well

<timemark seconds="9193" />

in the sixties it was a huge factor in an effect what happened you had a very close conservative society and then you had an outside shock in the form of the Psychedelic drugs and completely stirred up everything in art and music and fashion and even into scientific concepts of our place in the universe in time and space and and in so many ways that had just a a major impact on the direction that our society went and what would be the equivalent today or in our near future in terms of an outside shock it would suddenly wake people up would be another event another tunguska event and based upon everything that I've seen it would suggest that events like that are going to happen in probably within our lifetime and when it does happen especially if the message of the story has been out in enough people have heard it 5% of the people or 10

<timemark seconds="9253" />

send of the people are aware that there is this major impending potential paradigm shift and then we have an event like that an event like tunguska 19 and I think that's all it would take because these the magnitude of that event would have been such that it occurred today and you had anywhere from 1000000 to 2 million people instantly wiped out or a whole city instantly annihilated from a thing from a shot from space what effect would that have on on the planetary Consciousness sandwich with this latest exercise NASA coming late to the party finally seems to be thinking about what happened at 350 truck Agusta type of antwyr first laid out in the in the fifties and sixties and into the 70s was pretty much determined it was like something that would happen once a millennium once every couple of millenniums then it start

<timemark seconds="9313" />

are contracted to once every few centuries you know it may be that it's actually much more like one or two a century or maybe even perhaps cluster that's where you may have three or four or half a dozen of those type of events occurring over very short window of time but an event like that happening not one that would be caused the extinction of Civilization by any means but an event like that that could you know wipe out a thousand square miles of landscape completely in an instant would have a major effect I think on the people of this planet it would focus Minds it would focus Minds in a way that nothing else would and I it's not up to me is a pessimistic to say that might be what it's going to take or is it just realistic I don't know how do I think it's like the the massive Impact versus the slow trickle effect mean is it going to happen eventually or is it going to happen in one gigantic swoop because of an event like a asteroid impact were killed

<timemark seconds="9373" />

watch people and we wake up to the fragility of our existence I die the way it's a waking up both of them came out at the end. Using process that is happening that is in process now what's been happening in America as an outside of I'm enormously encouraged by the legalization of cannabis movement that is that is taking place here and I'm and what it and what it all means sure I like to smoke a joint but this is not about getting high it's not about Recreation what this is about is recognizing the sovereignty of adults to make decisions over their own bodies their own health and their own Consciousness while doing no harm to others that's what it's about about to really fucking important issue that is for me that is the most important issue because if we live in a society that is not prepared to recognize I don't sovereignty over one's own body in one's own Consciousness then that cannot be a free Society in any meaningful way and so I applaud the people of America in those States who have voted for full legalization that's a brilliant thing to do and that's going to have an impact around the world

<timemark seconds="9433" />

is the War on Drugs all the ideology and lies about cannabis are all going to be proved wrong we're going to know that the emperor wears no clothes that you can legalize cannabis and civilization does not fall apart as the War on Drugs Lobby have been telling us for ages it's going to it's going to change everything and it's a beautiful thing because it's the American people wear as the Americans State America as a governmental State presents on the world stage has beaten the dark force behind the War on Drugs so it's it's for me a beautiful thing that it's the American people state-by-state who a winding that back and sing We will not put up with this shit anymore I said what you were talking about earlier is really important to her talking about different factions of our civilization are creating it to his dad is still creating disinformation still trying to mislead people but I think that goes to what we were talking about before where it's a system in systems protect themselves and I think that's it

<timemark seconds="9493" />

it's scary and it was Yeah Yeah Yeahs on the bureaucracies I got a kind of personality there's no Financial stake and it's just a social steak like what you're seeing right now with the left vs the right now I just some people like my friend Wanda Sykes just got booed off stage at something last night apparently what you want on some anti Trump rant and then in people got super upset at her there's these systems are in place is it is it is almost like wanting to fight like that it's not it sets us up in this bizarre team mentality with his left protects its ideas of the future and the right protects its ideas and I'm watching these people go at it back and forth on social media and its toxic and I don't like to use that term because it's so compromised by in a toxic sexuality or toxic masculinity so many uses of that word in our culture but I think that this desire to fight with each other and be deeply unpleasant esic horrible things

<timemark seconds="9553" />

play the violin from the left to as well as the right eleventh and I think that we have to resist the urge to fight I think this is it when people push too far in the lap that's when the alt-right emerges when people push too far on the right that's when the left comes up and you know that's when you know Kent State emergency you have all these weird factions duking it out that have so much in common and a lot of times the things that they don't have in common it's either because of an ignorance or it's because of an ideological dispute or lack of communication and I think of those three things are in place at least open lines of communication which is also fostered by marijuana get these people talk about these things and you find out that one of our misgivings in our misunderstandings about each other or just misconceptions miscommunication and we've even if we disagree on things I have friends that I disagree on a lot of stuff with

<timemark seconds="9613" />

free clothes you're allowed to have different opinions course that's what makes the world interesting have to be we had at each other because one of the reasons why I'm with you it's to detractive to be on a team in the fucking Mason it's too attractive attractive and we love I mean we love City vs. City we love that we love when you know that Chicago is going to take on Cleveland folk you we love that the tribal tribal thing we going to wait wait we've not really evolved out to that we've changed our social structures but we still tribal tribal mentality Lodge with a lot more people could one more man

<timemark seconds="9665" />

what are you doing let's let's see the next one back to the flood this is the place that I didn't get to take gram that I really can't want it's okay I really wanted to take you here let's see it possibly do this is the potholes holy shit like this is crazy this what we're looking at folks if he who are just listening in you have to go to the YouTube now cuz this is insanity this is as close a like a knot for a dummy like me to look at something like that and I got all fucking for yeah that's definitely a river the river carved that you can wear what you're looking at there is a gigantic extinct set of cataracts like you would find it Niagara Falls but do you use Graham's term writ large

<timemark seconds="9716" />

working at a ridge we're looking East the tsunami wave that swept down over these four states one branch of it swept off to the West this particular branch of it was 400 ft deep well it just is Ridge and what it did was it spilled over the Ridge and down here in the foreground you see the modern-day Columbia River from the top of the ridge where you see the the agriculture in the landscape down to the river's about a thousand feet so you basically have to picture you've got this huge sheet of of water 3 to 400 ft deep it's rushing over and it finds a low little the lowest spot within this Ridge and that's where it starts focusing its energy and as it does it begins to just strip away the rock know what you're looking at here is this cataract complex is about 5 miles across and the water came in you see you've got those kind of curved Finger Lakes at the top and there's tunnels those are potholes that's insane

<timemark seconds="9776" />

songs by underwater turbulence in in in a flood this swiftly moving with this much turbulence you literally have for ticular Eddie's high intensity High amplitude high energy under water tornadoes literally under water tornadoes Maldives underwater tornadoes are typically in this case about a half a mile watt right there they're probably 600 ft deep is the water pouring Over The Ridges at least two hundred and you can see what it's done to the Bedrock anybody listening you got to you got to look at this you have to look at this and then listen to the scale this is this is a gigantic star in the landscape of which there are hundreds around this disengage be exact location rental this is potholes cataract the exact location

<timemark seconds="9827" />

Larry wants to get to it which we were in Washington state still in Washington State Central Washington can be right on the Columbia River just below Wenatchee that huge erratic 18000 ton bolt at Broad and chained in an iceberg an iceberg floating on the flood carry an ice baby the size of an oil tanker carrying and 18000 ton Boulder carried on the flood ground 700 feet out the valley side rest there's a flood waters recede the ice melts away and the boulders left sitting there of that bowl during the second one of the people dock in this part of the country where they think about this well you know they're only just catching on to what they're sitting on top of cheese if the first time I went out here 98 it was Didi the Ice Age floods Institute and I went to their only location which was a witch was in the Better Business Bureau in in Moses Lake Washington and it was they had one room

<timemark seconds="9887" />

in the back of this Better Business Bureau or no Chamber of Commerce Chamber of Commerce and it was two elderly ladies in there who are basically the overseers of the group now there's about two dozen chapters and every year there's several guided field trips led by geologists who are studying this in their off time and I've been on a number of these just to participate and get the the access to the geologist in order to pick their brains but this is this is very close to Wenatchee Washington so if anybody is wanting to find us on Google Earth this is a Google Earth image now that we're going to open before we leave the Google Earth image I was going to explain that you've got those you got those Cedar Lakes those this Meandering Lakes up there what you got two pictures you got a sheet of water coming and as it's coming over this Ridge it's beginning to selectively a road into fault lines and cracks with into Bedrock can you picture that the water is going to naturally try to go into those low spots where there's cracks in

<timemark seconds="9947" />

Fishers and it'll start going from a sheet into channeling what goes from sheet or Channel Linda then that spills over the Ridge and in the middle you see this it's called a rock blade to that The Rock played is that that that yes that's it right there separating the two alcoves if the flood he continued for another few days that rock Blake would have been gone I would have had a single Alcove up there now in the next as is this precedes what we're going to do is we're going to go down and we're going to be right at the head of the rock blade right there yeah right there were standing right there so now you're going to get to see as the Drone is about to take off your seeing the landscape we're looking to the east in the direction of those Finger Lakes

<timemark seconds="9995" />

and I guess the soundtrack

<timemark seconds="9997" />

is it not playing in The Sound. There we go in here it a little Toccata and Fugue in D Minor

<timemark seconds="10004" />

okay and the landscape opens up Ciara on that rock played we're on the Rock played right there as soon as the scale of this thing that we were just seeing from Google Earth weight when you described it I mean I would have just looked at it and go wow that's kind of cool looking I would never have thought that was obviously created by water pouring through that's the problem is because we haven't had the scale of perception it took Brett's 25 years to put the pieces together we'll also we haven't been able to take these sort of high-resolution photographs of Thrones right above it too recently yeah that's that's a gives us a whole other Insight used to be $1,000 an hour to get up there and helicopter now you can fly a drone around you know who would have known right here in the Middle Ground you see that big hole that's about 200 feet in diameter that's that's a pothole it was created by this swirling Vortex of hug massively turbulent water

<timemark seconds="10064" />

share this is incredible is all over the landscape and it's only in the recent years but it started to make sense be able to see this it's gonna be going out here with a drone I've been over this landscape several times in a small plane to see it from that perspective but now like he just said like Graham's you said now we got a drone it can go up and see it from a whole different perspective and and now you can see see the see the man standing right down there on the Rock now you see how that little dude

<timemark seconds="10099" />

yeah that little dude is 6 feet tall he's not that little mean on the pictures little not knowing what's me stunning that mean in this is really beautiful and cool and everything like that but what's really stunning as the initial picture where it becomes so obvious that the above picture we see the Farmland in that just gets so obviously cut cut slice of the Lambs the Drone flies over yeah so and then we have what's classic scabland you see all these mountains he's kind of lumps that's what what are the scabs on the scab land that's why it's called scabland and it's flooding

<timemark seconds="10148" />

is incredible in his water remaining yeah they were filled fill the potholes yet will they get a sense of what the volume of water must look like when I was rushing through there and see this is just as Prairie and potholes cataract we could be safe here for the next 10 hours looking at dozens and dozens of these major features and you look at there's a whole bar this is a Gravel Bar over there okay see those yeah I've never seen those reported in the literature it may be that nobody's ever secretly seen him before or no one's ever paid attention nobody's ever paid to Tampa there they are so how what is mainstream science used to describe this this sort of or mainstream archaeology used to describe these features should be geology

<timemark seconds="10202" />

Wildcatter psychology they so they believe is catastrophic flooding so I just think it's a slower they think it's lots of small had not not one not one big catastrophic flood and how what kind of time on are these geologist putting on us two or three thousand years now why do they think that well because of the The Ice damned model and how much time it would take see it gets complicated because until the comet research there was no credible source of heat that could melt that amount of ice and cold out now that's the new Factor that's come into the equation now you look at look at the people standing on the cliff Edge near the edge of the rock would you see him down there so now you get the sense of scale what would survive again in the aftermath of that dude something or his buddies this is a crazy Place Matt it's crazy to look at it's just so when you were looking above it

<timemark seconds="10262" />

and here I mean you get a sense of it but if you would just show this to me quite honestly I probably wouldn't piece that together

<timemark seconds="10270" />

but when you look at it the original image it's so blatantly obvious right well that's that's the thing now is we are in this position where we can we can see it in when I take people out in the field what I do is I prep them first by showing these images from NASA the outer the satellite photography the Google Earth imagery aerial photography been ground photography and then you go out in the landscape and at that point you can start having this framework for understanding what you're seeing otherwise you just don't get the scale of it is too fast it's really amazing this is so you know this is an adventure of exploration that we would just getting launched on this is this is recovering recovering the lost the Lost past of of humanity and if I may I want to make a pitcher game for the comet for the comet research group if anybody I think it's really important it's not it's it's not just a matter of finding their research it's also a matter of sending a message that we the people

<timemark seconds="10330" />

are prepared to take matters into our own hands and and support those scientists who are working with open minds inquiring into the past and whether you're going to give a dollar or $100 or whatever any little counts it it said it's the voice of the people as much as the money that really that really matters these guys are coming to research group they need that research funding they have an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign you can go to my website press the comet research group Banner it will take you to a page with all the relevant links please consider supporting it it's bothered it's worth while it's where they work and it has the potential to change the whole story of our past and our future it's a story that would be incredibly exciting to be a part of and that's what I'm trying to get people to think you look there's this thing happening and it really it is democratic and its own way and you don't have to be some Specialist or a particular Authority in some branch of academically approved science to begin to app

<timemark seconds="10390" />

preciate and understanding human being getting out into the field and seeing this kind of stuff firsthand getting it into the discussion and debate and in spending more time on this because it's it's such an interesting story about Scorpio scientist that the climate research group were offering that the people who contribute will participate in certain ways in the pedestrians walking along at the door being carried by this planet and all the stuff is all right it's it's your right to understand what the history of this crazy Rock has gone through this is amazing amazing stuff into perspective to understand this is like this for 12,000 years this story has been written into the landscape of the earth and only now are we able to step back and begin to see the big picture in in tandem with ever greater detail and what's emerging is really

<timemark seconds="10450" />

it's a really wild tail but the evidence is there to support it completely misses of initiative this is what I visit the story I told him editions of the going home this is mrs. recovering this this love memory it really is wild our time here on this planet has been confusing for so many reasons on one of the big ones is not a not understanding how we got here and that's one of the reasons why your book I think it's so important to me just give you this new perspective of how the sort of civilization emerged another problem and I think we deal with all the time is light pollution I think light pollution never see the stars it's I think it's really a perspective Blocker in a big way no that's it absolutely is having a discussion earlier about how ancient cultures related to the cosmos As Above So Below they felt their cells connected with the cosmos they made their monuments in alignment with key celestial bodies they did it very carefully that was a sense of Bringing Down the Enchantment of

<timemark seconds="10510" />

Heaven's on Tuan ANH THU it in modern societies we can't even see the stars in the middle of a big city the stars of Gone the light the light pollution just blots them out you never think they're there and you forgot to text me that you're part of a majestic Cosmo set the everything about it is Mystery we are immersed in mystery from the moment we're born to the moment with dye and yet our society is telling us how it's all very prosaic and all and it's just about production everything is all explained she don't really need to worry yourself about it too much cuz some Authority somewhere has it all figured out and no one has it all figured out some possible I think everybody owes it to themselves to go out into the desert in the middle of when when you know there's a stretch for the Moon is not going to be out and there's going to be clear skies especially if you live in Southern California you can get out to the desert pretty easy just get out of way from all the cities and look up in a freak you out in a freak you out because it's it's one of those things that you kind of really take for granted because most of time the sky is just a dark black featureless thing with a little couple of white.

Siddharth really that compelling when you get out there and see the actual Milky Way itself you go oh holy shit what's he now we could have every year there's probably a dozen high-altitude events that could have been Witness by ancient peoples that we are completely oblivious to be sexually equivalent to like Hiroshima size bombs going off 20 miles up in the daytime and night if you're living in the city if you're inside the light pollution by the time it happens it's over but if you're out in a completely Wilderness Area we've got a visual access to the stars and you're aware of that in your constantly aware of the presence of the sky you're going to see much more of that kind of thing happening then if

<timemark seconds="10630" />

Cosmos decides to get a little bit more active which it apparently does from time to time suddenly the sky is now becomes a major factor in your in your existence your tribal existence your cultural existence especially if you knows episodes you have multiple Fireball type of ants that could be on the scale of anywhere from Chelyabinsk up to 10 gusta and that's what clue Ben Napier that's their scenario is these clusters of of the we enter episodes of banh bot me to stream the stick with heavy debris asteroids of a kilometer or more in diameter when we enter those filaments we are entering a period of episodic bombardment when human civilization is at risk according to that constellations we are entering one of those filaments in the next 30 Years and that's why we need to pay attention to this because 30 years is enough time to do something about it if we apply the resources of a

<timemark seconds="10690" />

civilization to this we can solve this problem

<timemark seconds="10694" />

let's look at a couple more pictures cuz I like to get the picture of Graham I want to have sex too busy making new phones they don't have time to fix the asteroid thing exactly that's my my contention that it's going to take some of the serious commercial toolkit mining asteroids that is that is the way into this that if I can if they can if I can see an economic return for the minute that maybe they'll do the good thing I should do for the human right we'll just have to be a manned Expedition like Bruce Willis and then asteroid movie what's the image that one show did the folder of the one we open the folder of Awesomeness 1007

<timemark seconds="10741" />

when we going to look at here while we're going to go get some stuff and then we'll look at a couple of Google Earth things and then we will look at a couple of us Geological Survey things and then we'll look at some photographs

<timemark seconds="10755" />

$5 worth okay let's do what we got low holyshit this is this is an early one of the early NASA photographs taken from 500 miles up back in the late seventies act and what we got here is the two big stab land tracts that show two of the big meltwater streams that they have left their their scars in the landscape so each one of those is very roughly between 10 and 20 miles wide and the bigger one on the right is probably 50 to 60 miles long or actually a little bit longer than that but you can actually see that when the water swept down from the north out of British Columbia it washed away 200 ft roughly 1 to 200 feet of the existing topsoil it had covered the basalt Bedrock rights Bedrock by the way that was originally formed by eruptions of the Yellowstone Caldera interesting but the water came down Swept Away the

<timemark seconds="10,815" />

the topsoil and left the bear dark Basalt exposed down below the feature that we just looked at is not even really in this NASA photograph it's over to the west but let's go ahead to the next one Jamie went to the Snake River down there which is where is the Snake River Snake River comes up out of Idaho and it joins the Columbia and then flows out to the Pacific Ocean

<timemark seconds="10,843" />

alright then we got a Google Earth image coming up

<timemark seconds="10,847" />

what number is it okay is on order cuz there's just a lot as a lot of here tell me what you want me to 81001 what's going on with our TV keeps going off and on the TV is not really made for the way we use it so it doesn't like the inputs and I just turned it off so I can pull up the next one okay

<timemark seconds="10,873" />

there we go so now we're getting you actually a bigger view of of the landscape and you can see the two meltwater that's a scabland track

<timemark seconds="10,885" />

here and here okay no one can hear you if you do this is just tell me where it is I get it so there's the two scabland right then you've got the Grand Coulee which is at dark Raymond's going up to Columbia River their Grand Coulee Dam is right almost you almost had it it's where the Columbia River suddenly get skinny right there that's Grand Coulee Dam that's the widest the most massive concrete Dam in North America and its impounding water and Franklin Delano Roosevelt Lake to about four hundred feet deep right now all of the area at the top the grease need the Green Mountains are you this was all covered in ice and then over to the left right there you have that brown area and do you see the kind of semi circular Arc of dark ground right there that is where a tongue of the ice came out of Canada and it stopped right there and when it receded would it melt melt it back

<timemark seconds="10,945" />

what it did was it left all this trouble that can't really be farmed effectively this it's called chill glacial till and where the great where the glacier ended that's called more Moraine Moraine and you can see its circular that the glacier came and then coming right off the snout of the glacier do you see kind of up a ribbon eat that's a giant scar in the landscape that was formed by a meltwater stream coming off of that I shoot it's called Moses Coulee hey Randall I think we should keep in mind a lot of the audience and actually seeing the visuals on this they're not to take away all across the Pacific Northwest is a landscape that has been up to lease car and devastated by a gigantic flood that took place twelve thousand eight eggs left its marks everywhere and this is right near Coeur d'Alene so Coeur d'Alene is from the residue of this song called The geocosmic Rex website or the sacred geometry International website they can see most of the images that were showing

<timemark seconds="11,005" />

video they can watch it and hear you talk about it at the same time it's just that the vast majority probably 90% of our, just listen to watch it you can look down it way down on the lower left is the potholes cataract right go up a little up along the river come down south South coming keep coming. Look to the right of the river that's what we were just this man does his Landscapes to know to the right to the right to the right Jamie how dare you yeah this this whole area so we we get it this whole Aviary has been absolutely and unequivocally undeniably sale about we just looked at and now you're seeing that within this whole landscape yeah that was essentially inundated you'll start to get the scale of the thing and that's what I'm trying to do here if you joking

<timemark seconds="11,065" />

if the scale of this in your mind I've accomplished something yeah I think I got it from that one image was those are real mind-blower all the farmland and then there's massive Channel cut into it you kind of get it the ripples aren't even on this image their their way to the has anybody sat down with you and tried to dispute this I mean it's the people that believe that this was a slow and gradual the fact is anybody sat down and tried to debate you on this know it seems like something that would be really interesting to debate I mean I would love to see someone who is a geologist that you know I'm sure there's someone out there that is listening to this that may have a dispute with it but I would love them talk to you about it and go over all the various things the new clear glass if they find the I mean all of it all the way from top to bottom

<timemark seconds="11,125" />

book of the of the Comet research group with the Missoula flood effect that we're looking or accept us that's crazy because obviously it's such an obvious connection and it really Merit exploration if you guys didn't exist what if you guys were never born what if you never wrote that book what if you never been freaking out about this shit your whole life how would I know how many time zones are in the human story is this happened where stuff is just not being explored that really needed to beat sounds crazy to something like a Michael Shermer skeptical person spend a week Outnet landscape what he does want to debate you he wants it down to bait you come around I would love it in my mind there's really no. No arguing with with this this evidence I mean in in the question really comes down to it this point nobody disputes that they were catastrophic

<timemark seconds="11,185" />

the question is what was the mechanism how many were there how long did it take how long did it take it was it a bunch of catastrophic but small or flood or was it back to Brett's is original model of one giant flood and I think the truth actually lies somewhere between the two Hand and if you again to geology gets complicated but I'm writing it up so I will explain in detail what my thoughts are in after after having crisscrossed thousands of miles of this landscape repeatedly and basically absorbed every piece of scientific literature every written on it I've evolved some ideas about what could have happened here and how it happened well I was a grown adult and I found out that North America most of it was by it was at 10:12 thousand years ago was covered by a mile high sheet of ice I wish yes I thought I was a grown adult I don't know what is Minneapolis in

<timemark seconds="11,245" />

that anybody who's actually study the history of it but it never made it to my Dopey head until I was a grown adult and then I want to wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute why did the idea in my mind that this whole thing was covered just 12,000 years ago that seems so incredibly recent by the way the ice was more like two miles deep

<timemark seconds="11,265" />

could consider the weight of those ice masses pressing down I mean anything that was bad before the ice cave down would have been ground to powder and then as the ice cataclysmically melts everything below it is washed away forever it's like an eraser for the world and factored into their thinking when you're going yeah the evidence is you got to understand is that we have to rethink the possibility of evidence once we know that there has been these erasers of the world that have transpired and not just once by me what we're looking at here is probably the most severe events in the last 5 million years and I have a reason for using that number 5 million what's the reason the reason is is based upon the the the severity of the mass extinction we have to go back 5 million years to find an Extinction

<timemark seconds="11,319" />

advantage of an equivalent level as what occurred at the younger dryas it's funny because what I would call a knee-jerk skeptical person would always say that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence is there anything more extraordinary than that image of those farm lands in that giant swamp cut inside of land that's across the core samples of show this massive fluctuation of temperature at least one event and this cataclysmic episode immediately precedes the time when we've been told that civilization began yeah that's the other point which is really what we had this huge punctuation mark and then civilization suddenly start to evolve know it was there before this is a reinvention those hunter-gatherers like those people that would watch one of those shows would I survive in Alaska and watch their shows yes it shows a great like Life Below Zero

<timemark seconds="11,379" />

crazy assholes and they would carry on what is that I don't want to interrupt you Joe no worries no worries look at this wow okay so that to me I'm looking at this after what you told me that looks like water that is sort of like receded and Lefty's line Hillside after you take a bath in the water is basically brown with sediment what time you Leavin sediment your tub and I'm glad you're quoting Genesis and the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the Earth an old high heels were covered while trying to pump the biblical flood model not too far from it what I am trying to throw out and pictures whenever I realize he was a great quote and it doesn't matter where it's from because there's so many floodlight journeyman quote from

<timemark seconds="11,439" />

is it is one of those Smith's is one of those Traditions that have come to one of the thousands of traditions ancestral memory of the human race is telling us that something terrible happened it's it's also very unfortunate that's all that's all connected with an ideology that a lot of people find problematic like that there's issues with that being let you know religion of Korra call through this a faith-based police we must immediately realized the flood is not the property of the monotheistic religion is found in every culture on Earth to live at the Greek and a lot of loss in the process and that you're dealing with a lot of these stories were handed down from generation to generation for like what was it like a thousand years before the first version was ever written to be absolutely so all that's me that is unbelievably fascinating go to 1014 1014

<timemark seconds="11,497" />

it will see a topographic map

<timemark seconds="11,500" />

oh yeah woah just like you had a sandcastle or some flats and set up and a wave came in and cut through it and then pulled back the wave came from the north and it's swept down over the landscape and basically carved and plucked in Corydon gouged in gas that landscape and this one of the places Graham and I went if you look right in there you'll see where it says Grand part of Grand Coulee Grand right there with a Diaz we have a great video clip online of me and gray and we're looking at this actual topo map right here and end in surveying the the Cataract around us you'll also notice that there's a rock blade just like similar to the one that we just saw on the Drone footage in the Rock and you recognize the alcoves now yeah and if we go

<timemark seconds="11,560" />

the next one we have a Google Earth image of 1015 of this feature

<timemark seconds="11,569" />

and there's the Google Earth image and 4 scale in the upper left-hand superimposed Niagara Falls at the same scale as you can see by comparison wow if you see Brenda Niagara Falls Joe went when I was a little kid but I honestly don't remember I think I went when I was a little kid I have to check with my mom honestly that anybody looking at their sin in off the folks look at the the imagery on the online there's that one of the biggest waterfalls in the world yeah African or something yeah or South American baby Victoria Falls at it depends you know the highest ER the greatest volume it's it's about 200,000 between 150 and 200000 cubic feet per second going over those Falls depending on the flow of the river but that the flow that came through here was about 350 million cubic feet per second

<timemark seconds="11,627" />

I'd left this and I'm lying on the geocosmic Rex website there's a video clip of me and Graham down there just just buy Perch Lake Massacre know if the water that was created in Grand Canyon or the Niagara Falls by the right up there if that all receded and we could see the bottom wouldn't it look similar to what you see in here

<timemark seconds="11,651" />

the weather Grand Canyon right above it right there but some of the features that you see right there right now and that's the thing you were saying never gets fractal the interesting thing about water erosion and sedimentation is its scale invariant so you can look at features and coming up in the picture she I've got a beautiful example of scale invariance where you see the small version in the large version and it's exactly the same thing that's why if you going to any geology text they've always got something in the photographs Like a Rock pic or a person standing here otherwise it's hard to get a sense of the scale of what you're looking at right sum up my question though was that if that's the case if you could drain Niagara Falls and it would have a similar feature set what you're seeing on the ground there while we know the Niagara Falls have been doing that for a long long time at Niagara Falls in a few weeks

<timemark seconds="11,711" />

know that well for one thing to scale of it because you're not because in other words how long would it take Niagara to carve something on this scale if it's taking Niagara 10,000 years say to carve that how long would it take if an equivalent flow to carve this but it would look like if you drained it though what would it look like an equivalent any of these things but you see right here Basalt Bedrock so you're not going to see quite the same type of erosion because really what you what you got to consider is that all different rock types of Road differently also you know what happens if you have regimes of flow so that what you having in Niagara today is a lower flow regime which doesn't have anywhere near the type of turbulence or erosive potential is when you get water moving at 50 or 60 miles an hour one reason we definitely can know that this is the case is because we see the association with the giant current ripples we see the boulders that have been

<timemark seconds="11,771" />

clocked in Corydon some of them are 40 and 50 feet in diameter you see and what we'll look at some of those coming up in the next next picture do you have that image that you were talking about before of that one gigantic Boulder that was carried on the x is coming up if we move quickly through here we will get to it so go to go to 1017 and I will be from the ground view again with Niagara Falls superimposed for scale the Horseshoe Falls the Canadian Falls superimpose for scale basically that attracted Horseshoe Falls is about 120 ft in height the cliff wall of the giant cataract is about 400 feet high and then you see the beginning of the blade rock out there and the full extent of the thing actually goes all the way to the horizon

<timemark seconds="11,823" />

but we can't see that be on there but this erosion goes all the way to the horizons cut into stone that cut into Basalt hard columnar basalt that was extruded basically with the tune of the Yellowstone Caldera long 15 million years ago basically but then covered up by a couple hundred feet of topsoil and then that was exposed when the floods came through go to the next 1018 and you'll see an example of some of the debris that was left behind by the floodwaters when they finally ceased

<timemark seconds="11,861" />

there's the stuff that you're looking out the bigger stuff there is 30 and 40 feet those it be like four story buildings down there so those are just washed away by this gigantic River this right this massive gigantic River moving 50 60 miles an hour sweeps through their plots and tears the Bedrock and then wind of spigots finally get turned off the water starts subsiding in this stuff that's been carried in your just gets left into wait just like you're going to see any modern smaller flood is going to leave material and its weight the difference is this material is piles of Boulders the size of houses gravel bars 2 and 3 ft thick and 3 miles long and they're all in it so she hears the answer to your question is and this is what how breath finally did it was by showing that it was the full Suite of evidence taken integrally that created a picture that was undeniable to the Skeptics it was just it was overwhelming because it was every piece 50

<timemark seconds="11,921" />

to perfectly to endorse no other explanation other than gigantic hydraulic events and now it's a question of the detailed what caused them how long did it take and that's where the controversy is now these amazing it's amazing and terrifying but what's cool about as it's terrifying but everything's okay right now everything's okay right now it's like you feel like a be fine but maybe not if something like this happens again what you have to ask what what could be the change in you know in the human orientation to life on this planet like for example I remember the first Earth Day 1970 right when when this Consciousness about hey you know what

<timemark seconds="11,967" />

our existence on this planet is having an effect on this planet right and at that point you see this a whole environmental Consciousness emerge that didn't exist before that right well I think maybe in the next decade or two we're going to see a new environmental Consciousness that involves the recognition that this planet we live on is a very Dynamic place and has been so it is the key to deciphering a lot of mysteries geological cultural historical Inns and paleontological biological etcetera that that this has been a dominant factor in the evolution of basically everything that's been going on on this planet whether you're looking at millions of years are thousands of years

<timemark seconds="12,010" />

it's just it's such a strange time to be alive where all the stuff is coming to gather all this information is being exposed

<timemark seconds="12,020" />

hypnotic I've husband has been broken open and the stuff is spilling out and you don't know whether you've opened Pandora's Box by letting it out but it's a logical so easy to follow it's all I mean it seems like when it when it comes like a step-by-step to 1029 coming up 10291 Bingo guy let's roll travel about 500 miles south of out onto the Utah

<timemark seconds="12,049" />

Canyon Lake beautiful and what you're seeing there is basically dry cataracts now that you've seen these cataracts you can begin to recognize them all over the place now this is not been acknowledged as being a cataract but what you actually see when you look at the Modern a rosian is that these features are being slowly eroded and eaten Away by the modern Rose headed to the different Rhodesian regime all together that creates features like this and this is a vast scale of erosion here and when you travel all over the Southwest that is the most striking thing that you're going to experience if you're if you're going to end in empathic with the landscape which is that there's been this enormous amount of erosion and I'm not saying that this enormous amount of erosion was all created by one flight but I think what it is possibly saying is that when we go back over several million years gigantic floods on this scale aren't that exceptional that there's something that could

<timemark seconds="12,109" />

from time to time and see here's the thing this is completely removed from the glaciers any water that would have eroded this landscape was not coming from the glaciers it had to have been coming from rainfall to go if you go to the next slide Jamie wants out she's not hurt is not a disconnected element because if it cause of the massive rain out that was that resulted from the impact on the ice cap

<timemark seconds="12,130" />

what's this this is Valles Caldera us this is the largest volcanic caldera North America it's 11 miles across and here's what it was born out of a catastrophe millions of years ago right and then subsequent eruptions over hundreds of thousands of years have left this feature but what's interesting price here's what happened around 12,000 years ago the entire Caldera filled up Suddenly and if you look at right about if you look at it as a clock in about 8 you can see a breach of Valley coming off you see that Jamie can you right there that was the spillover so at the same time now get this at the same window of time that this displayed events are happening up in Washington and Idaho and Montana

<timemark seconds="12,181" />

this Caldera suddenly fills up with water and the water spills over the rim and cuts a canyon hundreds of feet deep now what could cause that to suddenly fill up with water and it's completely removed it's not receiving glacial meltwater there's only one thing by default and that would be rainfall a lot of rainfall falling over days and days at a time so if you go to the next slide will see what sits down in the bottom of this Valley is thousands of these gigantic roll Boulders and you know that their water transported because they're round their role that's what water does it rolls these things that this is a New Mexico City so this is related to the spillway the Overflow of all is Caldera which has been dated to that same interval when the floods were happening up north the same interval that now the, is dating to is this coincidence or are the two related I would say it would

<timemark seconds="12,241" />

very premature to dismiss it and say that they're not related get that because as Graham just said one of the ones that one of the consequences of an impact whether it's into the ocean or the ice sheet is you're going to have extreme amount of water vapor injected catastrophically into the atmosphere which is then going to rain out in in incredible torrential downpours that might last for days at a time and along with that water vapor is a tremendous amount of particulate mask and is that rain out that I would say caused the explosion on the Sphinx and tells us that the Sphinx is 12000 years old 2500 BC you guys are freaking me out

<timemark seconds="12,280" />

is amazing

<timemark seconds="12,282" />

this is the most convincing argument yet that you guys have ever made for this all the pieces let's go time together next flight Jamie which would be 1032 which is to me a beautiful example of scale invariant wow here we have the Snake River flowing in the modern Channel and then we have the ancient flood Channel and when she can see their the average annual discharge of the snake 56900 cubic feet but the estimated flood that created the big channel is 40 million cubic feet and actually was coming up get this out of Utah it was coming up as part of the giant Lake Bonneville of which the Great Salt Lake is but a diminutive Remnant so the Bonneville Salt Flats Bonneville Salt Flats with a bottom of this gigantic Lake

<timemark seconds="12,342" />

kick the field the basins of Northeastern Utah and at the end of the last ice age it's suddenly filled up very rapidly and spilled over a mountain pass to the North and then flooded this out that the Snake River plain of Southern Idaho in anybody can see the Snake River plain if you go to Google Earth or any topographic map and it cut channels like this that ultimately led to the Columbia River but interesting ly the dating of this puts it again right in that window so that window of 12800 to 11600 years ago when Everything Changes Everything changes into what I'm showing who just a little bit selecting random almost. To show you that no matter where you look you're going to see evidence of these of these of an imprinted into the landscape

<timemark seconds="12,394" />

yeah go to the next slide 1033 and if you go down and you stand on that floodplain down there

<timemark seconds="12,402" />

you'll see the kind of stuff that got left behind

<timemark seconds="12,406" />

this is the sediment load being carried in the flood wow

<timemark seconds="12,410" />

so you got it what kind of powerful currents are necessary to transport and I'm standing in the canyon that was cut by the flood those walls are 400 ft high so what we would think of is being like little pebbles at the bottom of a stream around in his Grand scale or river is this is what you're a geologist stardew morphologist with called the bed load the stuff being swept along in in the floodwaters re-rolled and Tumble and geologist recognize this but they think took mainstream geologists think it took a long period coming to the Future logical papers that have been written on this admit that it was a one big catastrophic flood wow and what is their explanation for that catastrophic flood weld it somehow Lake Bonneville rose up band and something right breach them up ass and its northern Rim but you know is that possible in any way

<timemark seconds="12,469" />

Well yeah if you have enough rainfall prolonged over a. Of time days or weeks that the whole body of water could have raised by 300 feet roughly and then it that you again you would need something like a competent like to provide you with a sauce for that rainfall in the aftermath of an oceanic impact and clearly the same thing would would follow in the wake of a of a nice impact what Oceanic impacts do we have on record only a few of them there's one up by Sweden we were discussing also the possible Indian Ocean impact which which create tsunamis on both sides of the Indian Ocean dated to about massive massive tsunami dispose of deposits and then again that this whole argument of the younger dryas cataclysm between 12800 and 11600 years ago the stronger

<timemark seconds="12,529" />

case is the focus of the science is being on 12800 years ago but there's a lot of interest in the 11600 years ago as well in the strongest

<timemark seconds="12,538" />

suggestion of what caused that that sudden rise in temperatures a company by meltwater pulse 1201b was a second encounter with more fragments of the debris of the, this time the impacts not being on the North American ice cap but in the major ocean probably the Pacific about that then put puts a huge plume of water vapor into the upper atmosphere and shrouds the Earth and creates the greenhouse effect that accounts for the radical rise in temperature that occurred 11600 years ago more science needs to be done on that it's another reason why I want to see the comet research group funded because this is this is important work goddamn is an awesome podcast yeah for sure it was roll OK 1039

<timemark seconds="12,591" />

and this is here now you'll be able to see actually a person in the in the field of view next to wanted a giant current Ripple and

<timemark seconds="12,601" />

there's a giant that's a giant current Ripple field we did see this one gram that's the West Bar yes if you go back one slide we can see an aerial photo I took years ago of wesbar it's 3 miles long

<timemark seconds="12,617" />

there it is well and there's an airport down the lighter-colored puffs of is a landing strip and the the the the airport building there is three stories tall so this whole feature is 3 miles long and the ripples here are on the same scale as the Camas Prairie ripples that we just looked at course this is in central Washington the other one was in Montana so he and you is we begin to place these event nodes around on the map and we can begin to see the outlines of that really really huge event and all of this is going on at the same time you got all this is the same time all this is dated to the the same time that you think the impact took place and it's all over that Coast the only dates that we have that are hard dates are a volcanic ash primarily from Mount Saint Helens the date at 13,000 years but they use that as a Baseline and then assume that there was multiple floods and each flood

<timemark seconds="12,677" />

separated by fifty to a hundred years and what they've done is they've gone from branches original model of a single flood into a dozen floods in 240 floods and now up to 80 or 90 floods which I disagree with but on the other hand they're worksheet I think you have to understand this in two phases because the initial impact phase is going to melt a whole lot of ice all of a sudden but it's not going to melt all of it it's going to leave a huge amount of residual ice in the aftermath now what we see is that particularly after the 11600 year ago event at that point the whole planet comes right out of the Ice Age inexplicable Saidi so that's the end of the beginning of the Holocene it's over and basically what we're seeing here is that there is a great deal of of heat suddenly that's brought the planet out of the ice and it does not convert revert back into the Ice Age like it did it to 12900 event say so

<timemark seconds="12,737" />

what we didn't have is it in the aftermath of this event the whole climate of the Earth has been completely altered to hold balance of Nature has been completely altered from before these events to after these amount but what you have now is a lot of residual lights that takes about two or three thousand years to melt away so sea levels continue to rise continue to rise and the melting of this ice produces some pretty big floods but not on the scale of what we're looking at here and I think it's my personal opinion that there's a confusion between the two different flood regimes and I'm going to document all the time writing all this up in detail as a as like as a thesis to explain my interpretation of the phenomena over 20 years but let's go to Bellevue so important I would love to see people

<timemark seconds="12,791" />

we'll go over this with a fine-tooth comb cuz it's so compelling she's so amazing like this this image itself is just wow what would what kind of power and force would it take to create those Rebels 50 foot high Ripple all over the place miles and miles and miles of them nothing since that event has really affected if they're still sitting here as these gigantic monstrous fossil features in the landscape now when they do core samples on that stuff or they find out like as far as the dating of it like if they get wet bottom one of those ripples why you got to be able to find organic material in there and to the extent that there's organic material it basically all day turn the end of the Ice Age the problem is is when you have a flood like this coming through its sweeping up everything in its path including for us an animal so if you got a bone in there or piece of wood

<timemark seconds="12,843" />

that doesn't necessarily mean when the flood happened to Brian it's not a nice layer of sediment it's a jumble messed up picture dig into the side of that hill at that same level and find something that's organic an absolutely dated to that cuz that's all Stone right right it's all jumbled chaotic mess up everything from find a sand and silt up to Boulders the size of cars and even houses and stuff just yeah that's so crazy go to 10:41 and we'll see an interesting artist rendition by

<timemark seconds="12,883" />

Edouard real who did all the illustrations for the jewels original Jules Verne books and he did a version for an extra geology text

<timemark seconds="12,894" />

that was a guy's name is skipping me right now but I thought it was an interesting image because it basically shows an event on the scale of what we're talkin about

<timemark seconds="12,903" />

and what's interesting here is you see that the torrents are caring icebergs and in this one iceberg in the foreground I call it grams Rock from now on it's going to be I have officially turn A leaf is carrying a gigantic older is talking about it it's now it's great because I went and climbed that one there so we got the grammar already coming up in about 3 images so let's go to the next one 10:42 and this is basically another key piece of evidence is strewn for thousands of square miles to Route the path of the flood you have these gigantic Boulders and these are being carried aboard Iceberg Sunny let me describe what we're looking at right now cuz it's a person is that you there I took the picture so it's two of my fellow Travelers a normal-size people and you know whatever 6 ft tall and bounce them on top of each other 1280

<timemark seconds="12,963" />

you're looking at probably the at least 35-40 feet alright and and wider wider than it is tall is 60 ft wide cuz that's insane and that was carried by water it was carried it was carried on icebergs yet in the water o my God that is not just water it's it's it's a gambling mass of powerful erosive flow amazing thousands of megafauna are done a lot of there been a lot of Mammoth remains found in Missoula flood sediments Valley okay let's go to the next image

<timemark seconds="13,007" />

are we go just like out in the middle of the prayer you can get you got thousands of these things to tell you what I'm a chicken I wouldn't stand right there I don't think that things going to roll on top of you that would be a rap son yeah this is known as Yeager Ross at things you judge is that you want to meet there no that's one of my tribe took the pictures tell him stay in there yeah I said stand there and then I had the other guys go around the back Rock the bush is thing is kind of hanging off the side of that Hill The Way some of those Hollywood Hills houses are the ones around still to see that that that rounded mass of stuff that it's sitting in is called a Berg Mound and you see these icebergs are not clean ice dare dirty they're filled with gravel and debris so when a bird when a bird it's been carried in the flood in the floodwaters subside the birds get stranded in the land and if there's no Boulder there's just a mound if there's no gigantic Boulder there's just a mild but if there is a gigantic Boulder being carried aboard the

<timemark seconds="13,067" />

Leesburg it will be sitting in a bird mild like you see right that's amazing so that white line that we see it was where the iceberg was when it deposited that thing then it just melted from there no that's actually a bedding plane between two different kinds of Basalt okay so the mound itself below it is what you're saying is the bird Mount that's the bird Mount cargo sitting on top of the iceberg okay so the burg is not just water its water with a bunch of dirt and all kinds of other shit in as well and so when it melts that's what it leaves behind Okay in the next image we have the Hancock erratic that you up there well that's me on top of that got in the 18000 I do that from time to time but it but it's it's a it's an amazing experience to stand there and to think what transported this while we know it was transported in an iceberg and it was up there on the side of that Valley and it's just

<timemark seconds="13,127" />

the thought of thousands of these things plowing along at 60 or 70 miles an hour carried on a gigantic flood how do we have anything left you know no wonder no wonder we forgotten. Prost in here's the thing to me what we're doing here is where looking where these flood events are preserved the most spectacularly in the reason is because you had a very steep gradient from the ice sheet elevation to the Pacific Ocean but like Graham and I when we traveled across we traveled across the Continental Divide and travel from the Rocky Mountains to the Twin Cities which is on the Mississippi River and all the way across we were caught Crossing huge melt water coolies we crossed the Missouri River Valley which is an under fit stream just very similar to the snake where the modern Missouri is just a little ribbing of river occupying this massive meltwater channel of which there are hundreds across the Plains and then when we got to Minneapolis we went up and we visited some of the large am known pot

<timemark seconds="13,187" />

we are again you're looking on the scale of giants this is this is beyond imagination while you look at them and they only this the flood explanation makes sense of it 05 for Jamie

and you'll see there we go I'm down inside the pothole one of the potholes looking up at Graham so that's a pothole carved into stone by Whirlpool picking up rocks in them in the rocks are the erosive agent that's cutting out the pothole massive hydraulic drill just picking up coarse Rock and it just drilling literally drilling holes 50 60 80 ft deep again go to the YouTube please if you're listening to this just go just got a fast forward to this is insane insane just thinking of watching Rock spin around

<timemark seconds="13,249" />

probably you know I'm guessing you know these giant water floats this is right along the st. Croix River which forms the border between Minnesota and Wisconsin

<timemark seconds="13,258" />

it was probably of several weeks duration at its peak at its peak and so the drilling of these Bedrock probably was accomplished within that time span what I wouldn't give to know what that was like to see it

<timemark seconds="13,273" />

what year did had to been in orbit to survive it right yeah even if you're flying over in a plane probably they just the atmosphere changed lives on top of these flood sediments from documented it from Ohio to Washington State there are thick layers of lost the Loess is this strange topsoil that came down and it's they've been arguing for Generations is it windy positive or water deposited but the Curious Thing as it seems to be both wind and water deposited but I think the obvious explanation for it is this that when you see the the it like the the top layers of the flood said it was particularly in the back flood regions where the where the water was calling rather than show tarantula you see these layers these beautiful clear call rhythmics they're very rhythmico on top of that is a layer of this plus topsoil with this vertical structure right well to me and it again

<timemark seconds="13,333" />

are getting into the technical background I think the logical explanation is most likely explanation is that at the tail end of the the final flood flows what you're seeing is is rainfall of mud and this rainfall of mud came down in a in a pack of many ancient Traditions speak of black bituminous rain mud falling from the sky Darkness time of Darkness it's all described in The Mists are the memory banks of of humanity we should not call the myths we should pull the memories we are exactly this muddy rainfall perfectly fits the whole narrative ethology it's it's it's right there when we think of these the idea of the snow makes me think of water that you can see more most likely dealing with the entire are around you filled with other Rancho foreign solid matter and everything's flying through the air and credible wins incredible wins yes so it's both wind and water and just full-on chaos superhero

<timemark seconds="13,393" />

retains its nature gone chaotic and crazy on Ultimate steroids this is what it is hoe wild it happen while people are alive oh yeah it happened while people were alive absolutely love being around for a little but not according to the Orthodox historians but if we didn't With A Lost Civilization which I believe to be the case then yes it's totally totally makes sense pletely totally makes sense and its time its time to get to grips with this it's time to move move forward to the next level and start recovering our memory also start recognizing this is this is a potential reality this is not just the past is also very possible to gain if I may say so
