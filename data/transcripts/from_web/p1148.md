<timemark seconds="237" />

The Joe Rogan Experience

<timemark seconds="247" />

call Reliable Williams betting on look look around real quick do you know what's new

<timemark seconds="254" />

easy it's easier than you think

<timemark seconds="259" />

Bruce Lee Bruce Lee still but still though he didn't say he goes out wonderful Savior Rise Against on his head now I should have bet you money I was going to say it this dope in high school and they use one of his quote on my favorite he says honestly expressing oneself is really hard to do I can use to I can use really fancy movements and show you really crazy things but to honestly express myself that is really hard to do it's a great like a beautiful little sound clip before they start the song that's like just him talking to someone isn't it humbling when someone dies really young like he does and they did way more in their life and you ever will makes me sad like what am I going to do you stop and think about it like who the fuck else has had that kind of an impact and you know what he died in what 1970 something in the 70s

<timemark seconds="319" />

he was young yeah I think he was like 30 or 31 or 32 or some like that find out how old Bruce Lee was when he died

<timemark seconds="327" />

it's not like I was listen to Hendricks last night on the way to Studio or a lot where the comic store 33 and how much are out there he died when he was 27 you think he'd be happy with what's going on to it like I always find that like what would they be doing today

<timemark seconds="348" />

trust me up I can't do that no I know but that's all they had such a good because right there's guys that lasted a long time and they either like or making garbage slowly still making cool shit here and there whenever they want to yeah this is the variety show in those people that nobody wants to hear the new shitt the Rolling Stones The Rolling Stones play that don't play that weird though because all time greats start playing some song you haven't heard back is all this yesterday I was when I was running they have this thing called the Big 3 it's a post NBA league for players to play in once it once every Tire in just 3 on 3 but it's really sad to watch guys ever retire for like 10 years hooping cuz you're like this is just bad it's like you want to just remember them when they were amazing but now they just sold 2

<timemark seconds="408" />

old to be it's like it's like a circus it you know I mean like people are showing up just to like see those names but they're there it's really bad to watch how old I mean there is no minimum I just retired from the lead to play in it look like I mean the average age is got to be 40 maybe see it depends on the sport in the athlete lab is Argo skins was fighting in his forties at his best different though yeah basketball is just such a young man's game that's like a hard to watch and I'll do with gray hair missing free throws that's a weird a guy who used to be phenomenal I understand what you're saying but I disagree in the ACT it's even sadder watching an old guy get the fuck beat out of them used to be good but fight but but then he still probably fights cuz he loves it no no money because they love the competition but they get paid for doing it for me

<timemark seconds="468" />

no way they enjoyed anymore do you know there's no way it just looks so sad everything left right left right A B Davis and he was being so heavy on his back and it's even worse around for like 5 minutes I like this is so sad to watch their cameras are just focusing on him and Rapaport is doing the announcing so weird he's like a eight-year-old 20 year old yes

<timemark seconds="511" />

he's just his career is on this crazy Revival train and it's almost like he is going back to Young rapaport's die so funny dude where is alaria interviewing I forget what what sport it was who's interviewing these guys and he's like kind of hunched over like I'm talking to him and he's a big guy he got this look on his face is it if you would like this is such a weird combination like an old guy at a young guy that was in like that that youthful world of like music and sports in your see the ramp if you went on after Charlottesville what does tiki torch Carrie and white guys

<timemark seconds="560" />

the fuck is

<timemark seconds="562" />

please loose you know I mean he's out there usually he's very funny on the fighter & the kid to it goes on that Shelly says he loves you. He's he's vocally a massive sports fan which I think that's keeps him in that youth Circle so much that he just love sports and love talking Sports to everybody show sometimes like he's hosted different people's one of those radio TV shows those radio shows that consulate they show on TV occasionally. Patrick has like the problem is people try to talk to me about other sports guy fucking believe that game of soccer I can't tell you I couldn't tell you what position other than goalie

<timemark seconds="622" />

yeah you name one forward see but I think I can I think about hockey cuz I'm like I know hockey but I have no idea about this and talk at the same soccer just was like a good Fielder defense defense I was in Italy won the World Cup was going on it was amazing to watch Europeans watch that shit cuz they love it checked out totally checked out I know it's dorky white guys pretending to be way too enthusiastic about the world cards because the World Cup

<timemark seconds="670" />

fucking Jack but it's not real Olympics does that to the Olympics has this thing where people get into like it's cool to cheer for your country or whatever but it's so funny when people get in the Olympics and I like you watch a luge did you watch as rip it up and lose no I don't I don't know I do like the Winter Olympics everyone get freaks out and if sport that you would never even think about wanting to watch like a cross country ski and then you shoot on the ground in the excuse him or you would never I would never forget two basketballs going to be in the Summer Olympics is it really this big 3 players Olympics

<timemark seconds="720" />

yeah dude I look this up in a damn was so surprised I don't know what kind of competition it's going to be but the big three success as led to it being included in the next Summer Olympics born in normal basketball game 10515 five-on-five shot

<timemark seconds="739" />

which doesn't exist so you can shoot at once it gets down to 4 minutes that like there's an onside assisted the basketball tournament which is like amateur players and teams it's a $1000000 tournament we should would have lost but we just don't talk negative to me bro you don't know my heart for you guys and former college players to average height of 5:10 but they have white heads to say hi fellas so what are the rules

<timemark seconds="799" />

there's a 4.0. I don't know if you fell out so maybe you could just use you as a bowl in Fallout you just how what happens if you kick you out you're done you can't play the games over players on their bench they rotate Jesus but we would have you file as hard as you can to really fuck up their best players and I mean I have that they have that the hockey. Him he's a fucking truck so he would just get the ball they would Tomahawk as hard as they could

<timemark seconds="859" />

ouch sports fans do you have no idea how he is big but another huge dude that just throwing their arm as hard as they can all game wow I would like to be would like to begin it happened before that old NBA people get the biggest guy that's ever played with whatever I shake his hand on my desk so he was a huge Fear Factor fan. So he did like a whole episode where he co-hosted with me and he stood next to me and you like he would do that I want you to count down Sugar Factory in when he would do the cow. I was standing next to him like this like an 8 year old hanging out with his kid's dad all I hear stories like that that he's like he's a big kid

<timemark seconds="919" />

eight-year-old super fun guy tell him he's like a cop yeah like undercover work for in Miami or something right now in Fort Lauderdale would be involved in pretty hard to be undercover when you're 6:11 and must I mean you know when you get up Nexus arm it's it's it's this it's like two of my thighs be done in the MMA for a while I don't know if you still look if there is no weight limitations like he's so got it like that that I am so fucking pig

<timemark seconds="979" />

a man and his buddy child child in a grown man at the MTV

<timemark seconds="988" />

what was that movie where the sound like that with him next me where I was just you know interviewing him for this thing and he will always be one of the road and he doing this with the microphone you still at the dog on my eject is kind of weird that like the UFC has a weight limit what's the top out to 65 does it get does a hit these at super heavy super heavy we've never had a super heavy fight the super heavyweight is to 65 and above will who's the heaviest fighter that's ever fought 265 when they weigh in after that probably Brock Brock was cutting weight to make 265 was being around 300 lb I for sure it's a different kind of 300 pounds to 3:37 to put one

<timemark seconds="1038" />

his shoes are 22 ft I could never fight in the UFC cuz you probably can't make 265 from now if you did would be sure 0 0 fat cuz he's so big 75 lbs right as they say 330 S O D Wade

<timemark seconds="1067" />

they look like as a rookie my God he was so full grown man at 20

<timemark seconds="1081" />

I mean what did you ever see the movie Blue Chips do you ever see that know that's a great movie about Shaq Nick Nolte he's recruiting him it's from it's a phenomenal how good is that guy was awesome oh he's so good in this fucking movie Warrior

<timemark seconds="1113" />

it was flawed but he's good he played me literally did my role in the UFC and I'm moving you tell me is I'm just going to you except for like the skill in the talent all out there but Nick Nolte's in that fucking movie Nick Nolte plays the dad of one of the guys that's fighting and Darius like that I ran into him once man at Fry's I was so happy my name cuz he used to date Vicki Lewis was a friend of mine she was on the news radio girl she's that girl's extremely talented she's young compared that was a big age Gap so I knew him from the set and hang out and I said hey

<timemark seconds="1173" />

Call you a noob and then use two zeros foros Noob fucking right now there's two million-dollar tournaments going on there's one that I think they're both but one for fortnite and then another one another again it's just like it called pubg which we've talked about the 2 million bucks how long do they have to play tournament on real loser and they still have that shit in their head but it's just more money in it then most game we might blow his fucking ankles out Timmy over there is making a billion dollars

<timemark seconds="1407" />

he was like a professional online gamer and I thought I was like that dude fatality reached out to us Jonathan Wendell I'm going to try to get them on I figured yeah he was the greatest quick player or one of the greatest there's a few of those guys sound like that yeah that sounds right what is he doing I was no one that I want to know what they do when they quit all that shit just just breathe Just Chillin try to figure out how to deal with all the radiation they been absorbing he's working at Fry's computers created by Joe all your cells are mutated and I think some of them are sizes and how quick the fall might be that they're just would have banking money and just write it out to see how long that goes you only get paid paid if you win

<timemark seconds="1467" />

all that money right they still got to have something to do after it's done the best bank but time you guys are just making a late I just the way it's different they don't have to pay coach on their part in some cases their parents house still most cases right by their parents new house that might be there gold a by their parents house and kick in the fuck out by the parents house. Yeah I remember you were yelling at me play video games Mike I take care and I don't know how to get to take credit for

<timemark seconds="1522" />

no I didn't and I can't do that but that's what that is her mom was you saw that was fucking atrocious and then when every time she got something she's like you know why that is cuz I made you that way so she she mine fucked her whole life into being like even at her even when he she even after the after the incident even if the Kerrigan thing she was like I was always the one that made you the killer that's why we do this oh she fucked her so bad and she fucked with her head so deep she was boxing oh yeah man I talked about it on Stanhope shoebox Doug Stanhope yeah I was I was his coach you doing cuz she was trying to cash checks cuz she lost all her money man she lost all her money made much and what do you think she does know

<timemark seconds="1578" />

<timemark seconds="1638" />

right I bet he lefted Vegas was like he's fucking idiots will figure it out I bet they were on meth and they're all going to need knees knees and smashed into a car and almost hit one of the guys that was fucking dude tweaked out of his mind came driving through the back of the parking lot in the store during the day slammed into a car slammed into one of the employees cars it was parked back there they got security camera footage of its guys are jumping out of the way. Just like completely out of his mind it turns out the guy years ago killed a kid driving slammed his car into some fucking kid in and kill them like a young girl fuck and then many years later is still driving fucked-up tried to back out try to get out of there I still grab them

<timemark seconds="1698" />

what is this the guy yeah man arrested after vehicle collision at The Comedy Store yeah that guy kill the Kid Drive-In and he still doing it and he was peeling off of sunset it's smashed into The Comedy Store he was out of his mind man is out of his mind came in sideways went around the corner and went through the driveway went around the corner to the lot and came in like literally turn sideways and slammed into a car what the fuck drugs do the wrong kind of drugs who knows what kind of pills is fucking assholes on

<timemark seconds="1732" />

but that same guy kill the kid still driving like that imagine you kill a kid driving fucked up you get out of jail and then you're still doing it you're not old you look at somebody made that kid so many made that kids something to eat somebody fuck somebody and the demand woman got together they did got pregnant the girl got pregnant the gave birth raise that kid and this is what you got a bad deal but you can't tell me that's not part of their fault too there's got to be some shit that they fucking did to that kid for sure there's got to be something so that's a collective effort when you get some of those that fucking stupid. That's that you kill a kid and you don't learn like that's not enough of a lesson you still driving fucked up how did Caitlyn Jenner get away with killing that dude what was the turning a woman that was a batch of slice off your dick that's it

<timemark seconds="1792" />

she entered into this category of the most marginalized group in America currently which is transgender people and the entire focus of the nation she wasn't paying attention and she slammed into the back into the back of this person's car it was a dude but it was a single dude that was a woman in a traffic to kids in a gram on the body lift with the grandma because she broke her hip and pelvis or something like that thing is Caitlin doesn't even address it like it's like some horrific moment in our life completely responsible it but it shows you the type of person you ever see Kyle Dunnigan sing on it

<timemark seconds="1852" />

funniest its butt of yours he the one he did on that Caitlyn Jenner butt now Kayla's got a clean record down again that is such a fucking hysterical character character that he does on his Instagram have a much better driver than Bruce I'll have you know so don't be afraid to hit the street

<timemark seconds="1895" />

<timemark seconds="1955" />

<timemark seconds="2069" />

it's like a completely new way of doing sketches making characters yeah it's wild it's almost funny because you know he's behind it on it so you know but yet it's so good like what he does like Kim and Kanye is a washing machine is a weird white box

<timemark seconds="2099" />

that's so perfect. Now I just love that these like technology created like there's a bunch of you two people to do that they're doing like these weird YouTube videos and there's so many people but it's like heat but he's found it and it like a real specifically funny Niche because he's cuz these real of the characters of Throne characters sketches and they're just kind of so cheaply down and they don't have any like they don't need comedic base. Just like weird to have some kind of basement there's a few people that do it right my kid loves this lady Miranda Sings do you know that that is she's just she's got the show called awkward show picture of Miranda Sings

<timemark seconds="2159" />

that's so try to do it just for my daughter but it's a show that's not for kids that's her it's a weird show like the show I'm watching she had a Netflix show did they cancel I don't know if it was a movie or show actually I might buy rocking kid love that show and that's what it's called haters back off is that a movie or a show to show the trailer

<timemark seconds="2190" />

<timemark seconds="2213" />

Conn's zebras and my daughter's 8 will do an impression Tim and Eric type show it's not really a show for eight-year-olds it's just a mind fuck show so I'm like letting her watch it but then again she lives with me yeah no shit sound like going to say would have been what did you watch that you know you should have been watching when you were a kid to try to not swear for the first 5 years of their life and then I'm like impossible stop were they going to learn about something early I'm nice or fuck what's the big deal I don't say like I'm going to fuck you to my wife I don't say that

<timemark seconds="2261" />

your kids are eating dinner I'm going to fuck you late night your mom made you might do the moment when my daughter was 3 we were skiing and we packed up all the stuff we're getting ready to leave but we didn't pack up her helmet and so we got all that stuff. I've got everything the helmet argue we have impact the helmet three-year-old daughter looks at the helmet looks like a bag goes shit

<timemark seconds="2294" />

what does the following were like but we tried not to look at it

<timemark seconds="2304" />

It's such a weird thing to say

<timemark seconds="2363" />

you know what you got to do eat mixed nuts literally nuts make your nuts grow nuts dr. Rhonda Patrick posted something about it will help sperm truck say it that way if you eat certain amount of grams of the Tweet of mixed nuts makes your balls grow but literally makes your sperm increase what makes your balls shrink there's got to be a food that does the opposite steroids it makes your balls shrink because your balls aren't making any testosterone you said it doesn't it doesn't reduce the amount of semen you produce and make your physical nut smaller

<timemark seconds="2423" />

I met him at the Trader Joe's parking lot here to inspect them are put gloves on put the put them in my mouth and I'll tell you what's wrong with your bag for the monk who makes your brain shut off

<timemark seconds="2458" />

call the nutman go to make you feel weird because it's like a such a deep sound like why am I coming to this deep sound an imprint but deep sound coming noises like what the fuck do you mean

<timemark seconds="2494" />

Meredith supplemented their diet with 60 grams of mixed nuts daily for 14 weeks increase their sperm count by 16% sperm Vitality by 4% and sperm motility by 6% according to a randomized controlled trial my husband into it every day for 14 weeks those dudes are mixed nuts and shit like you can't come at all except for the study in the cup otherwise we're not going to know because of you banging all day one day and the next day you don't do anything if you get tired, sad lazy cups come comes out different I don't know if I could take a few days off of beating off the ceiling

<timemark seconds="2554" />

and just kind of dribbles out you feel like a loser I feel very depressed volumes low like if I beat off and it just makes you sad why I find it always depends on how much I build up if I'm building up to it I got a big one builderall you edge a fucking pervert fuckingawesome Norton. Tell me about it the edges he he dead with prostitutes he get a prostitute and you get right to the point of coming alright thanks how long ago yesterday no one was one of the prostitutes

<timemark seconds="2599" />

that buys the free doesn't give a fuck he does give a fuck but he doesn't give a fuck at the same time but she told me when they leave yet he's bumb the fuck out what you should be free you know that this guy was reading something so some guy was doing something an anti shame things as a doctor like fuck shame was like his his thing that shame is a weird thing like there's things that people are ashamed of that we're not ashamed of it all like sex like normal sex like save your wives walk around the house a pair of shorts and grab her ass and she you know and she turns around she smiles at you in the two of you start banging that's fine you married each other are you attracted to each other it's all normal but if you lived in like a crazy religious household what she supposed to be dressed like a fucking tablecloth

<timemark seconds="2653" />

that would be a real problem awful should feel ashamed so it's like what causes shame cultural acceptance right place right time from from their parents for stuff that's they shouldn't feel ashamed about it for sure and for Norton so I keep az's nice ladies to touch his penis and that's why they don't have to work at Denny's they still do I break it going to smoke break and go to gym for an hour and a half dishwasher hands kind of like real rink like really really strong fingerprints indentation. It's got like the Fingerprints of deeper than normal all the chemicals dishwasher and washing all day

<timemark seconds="2713" />

part of the problem it's not a problem he's so successful you know Jim sells out, he chose everywhere he's got a Sirius XM show he's written books he's got plenty money for hookers so he's like fucking here

<timemark seconds="2726" />

he's like the most free guy that I know and terms of a talking about his weirdness and his perversions sober yes he got sober I think when he was 19 he's been sober the entire time that's fine but it's like trannies he's really into trannys for real yeah whatever anymore I didn't I was with gay friends at a what I put on line having the most fun at a Mexican train about people litany the fuck up but it's not that I was like okay I was with gay dudes add a joke about it with me I thought it was okay that it say you can say transvestite

<timemark seconds="2783" />

you can't say tranny Justin Martindale can say whatever he wants he can he does he gets away with what he says constantly I didn't know that he doesn't but I just want to put that up. I don't think you get that kind of freedom but if you were gay black guy Daddy I think your gay black transgender guy can do whatever he wants no legs and one eye he's disabled gay black Trans

<timemark seconds="2829" />

what's interesting no bun I mean no one accepts transracial can't do it no one except transracial is the one thing that we are not willing to cross no fucking way it is one of the most realistic lines this is why I hate butts yeah for sure but mean literally all human beings came from Africa that is the cradle of civilization so we're all African so why can't you pretend to be an African why can't why can't you just be it that's really what it is his name for sending you just say that's what I identify was I get it to me is like when people say like you can't you can't be a general design a male or a female

<timemark seconds="2879" />

so I can people say yes you can and that's accept it but if you said identifies Puerto Rican

<timemark seconds="2885" />

they're like no fucking what is there any race that would that you in like that is anyways yeah, I think I've got a little bit of a pass to have a pass we have a passport size eyebrows what a fucking weirdo man that's a weird things hair.

<timemark seconds="2917" />

when I was at when I was a kid it bother me like crazy and then I got older and give a fuck and then when you get older there's some women that like it that like that are that that that think that's more attractive cuz it's red I know something went wrong what people like what's your weirdest specific thing that you said when you like this when you first started getting into check when you finally figured out what your style was what was the one thing you like that's weird most people don't like that about girls you know some girls like like like like chunky bitches young Jamie over there

<timemark seconds="2965" />

Show on Netflix about a girl who used to be fat and then she got skinny and that's fucking I want to watch how would they take that off at so I'll see if I can find some really pretty girl but people very angry about it about the premise why fat shaming what is it called stereotypes for young women

<timemark seconds="3016" />

but listen I'm going to tell you guys this really really clearly if your children fat they're eating too much sugar okay that's a fact fix that or try but don't don't just call people fat phobic if your children there's a lot of nonsense that's involved in people's bodies and education and the big one is what they eat has no bearing on what they look like that is horseshit giant fat people in the 20s they were all starving to death they're all skinny in the bread day was never know what someone fucking told me a Jordan Peterson told me that's why we got to look up look this up emulsifiers emulsifiers and he was reading something about emulsifiers that are used in fast rising yeast and in a lot of bread products are responsible for leaky gut they have an impact on people's sense of

<timemark seconds="3076" />

what is the gluten and he was saying that like ammo suppliers are basically like fucking shampoo you know you have like oil and water and you pour some dishwashing soap on the water that's in food like that's a similar quality so caught that's what's causing all these like tested it was just a bunch of is the more complex gluten cause used to be that you would get like like if you would have it's like old wheat was like a small little sort of grain was a smaller plants and then they started changing it and I start changing and selectively breeding it with this are doing is making it thicker and more dense and and that way you get a much higher yield per acre but in doing so they also made it more difficult for your body to absorb process that uses fast rising yeast

<timemark seconds="3135" />

images emulsifiers in it and then I'm also fires are apparently terrible for your body which makes sense cuz you go to fucking Italy you eat some of that over there it doesn't make you feel the same. Doesn't she don't feel it's thick I feel like you I feel way sick or when I like I feel Dumpty when I get back home so that I can buy online that's from Italy any but it's it's using it it taste better if you feel better I know that sounds like it's if there's someone that it's an American it so everytime I see a fat birds of a thousand bucks. Why aren't they fat and if they let their lifestyle and their food choices

<timemark seconds="3195" />

very healthy food the other one I'm just going to have sugar free diet and Jamal fat in the fuck out of just to show Society what's up just wanted to see you and put it on a boat and some of the premise of the show plot I guess I'll be the weight oh my God that is so fucked up that's kind of fucked up wait a minute

<timemark seconds="3614" />

and people love if you they set up fight two dudes fought over this one girl they were both fucking the kid that they thought he was he was he was just a tough kid but he had he had it was the middle of winter or else I'll never forget and he have really bad acne and the other kid every time he landed a punch you would like to see the redness getting worse and is acting The Blood start coming out of his face the girl but you also get your ass kicked he was even more fucking Brash guys please when she

<timemark seconds="3671" />

yeah she watched him do it and the whole fucking school watching and then somebody it would probably win that fight but once I remember somebody taped and tape for getting passed around but this is what about school the school rule things like athletes we always had this guilty by association ship if you're there you get to spend it even if you had nothing to do with it Kodak on duct wait a minute to party and it gets busted by the cops and I don't have alcohol drugs on me or nothing but I'm at that party and it gets back to the school and the coaches I get suspended from whatever there's a Code of Conduct at Netflix I'm sorry just for laughs rather Jamie Netflix are they keep saying that they posted everywhere I'm sure

<timemark seconds="4281" />

what are you do you start drinking the booze I don't quite remember what it was rumors about he had he was at covering up he was really sick he had cancer right but they didn't realize it doesn't

<timemark seconds="4293" />

I thought he denied it for you I thought it was a good thing where people were like

<timemark seconds="4297" />

he's keep that he said he was sick but it wasn't cancer that you like outside Val Kilmer's to red bottle and come back in the Top Gun sequel oh so you guys looking better there let me see that don't grow up stop at the Flash's you assholes who looks like that's what he used to look like and ask me anything weird Reddit so funny but that should have said a while ago Michael Douglas claim do you have terminal cancer what was the story behind that

<timemark seconds="4331" />

and he said killer responded

<timemark seconds="4335" />

okay you can read that quicker he was probably trying to help me cuz what the fuck did we what the fuck the folks because the the screen got filled with all of these pop-ups for possibly new videos you want to watch while you're watching a video I did have a healing of cancer but my time is still swollen although healing all the time because I don't sound my normal self yet people think I may still be under the weather the weather that's a that's a pretty bold sleep but when he got really fat butts that's one of the reasons why I got cancer I bet he was like really unhealthy because I think it wasn't just see I don't think it was just that he got cancer I think he also was like really fucked up for a while health-wise in terms of luck he just looks so different booze and chant yam

<timemark seconds="4391" />

2015 was rushed to the hospital before that receipt before 2015 and it looks like 2,000 what what was scroll up 2015 juice left to the juicy running errands and London without his tracheotomy hole out the Cancer 2013 all Michael Douglas age for oral cancer

<timemark seconds="4451" />

his wife too much was not like a big thing that he was like he said it was a rumor that he said find out what the story about that as we probably should clarify as I want to know what she got really mad that apparently I mean yeah cuz she's like yeah that's gross from licking a lot of pussy is diseases that specifically come from sex Michael Douglas I was sorry for the effect of oral sex cancer comments on my wife okay what did he say though inside regret of the embarrassment cause to his wife Catherine Zeta-Jones by the Revelation 2 years ago that has cancer may have been caused by performing oral sex probably just joking no

<timemark seconds="4510" />

I think it was if it is illness was a result of Contracting the human papillomavirus which experts believe can be brought on by cunnilingus I love that word the store made headlines around the world when Douglas was promoting his emmy-winning role in Liberace biopic Behind the Candelabra after being declared free of cancer by the way did you ever see that movie is Matt Damon a fucking bit on that that unfortunately has been lost cuz Joey Diaz has never really done a special other than one special couple years back but you to do special on Joey Diaz what you really do you need to have Joey do like five nights in a row and just turn the cameras on every night and just let him go lose me up and then fill it all and then eventually you'll get that Joey Diaz mom

<timemark seconds="4570" />

lose On Demand with a bunch of put makeup on him and everything becomes artificial and everyone sits in the wild man that is he's never a lot of his greatest bits or never been captured but Michael Douglas doing Liberace bit that was so good it was so good cuz that if your watch that documentary well crazy Liberace when he got up like a pump for his dick couldn't get hard anymore see it like a little

<timemark seconds="4613" />

<timemark seconds="4850" />

yammy West like I'm so confused nobody wants to fuck me this is so weird Liberace had no trouble getting all the dates he wanted and he Glory did escorting well-known entertainers to parties getting his picture taken with Susan Hayward Halestorm Rosemary Clooney and may Westwood computer Judy Garland Mae West was the only one of his so-called lady friends that I actually met as they say in Texas May was a hoot who wrote this to the drunk just a gay website cuz what's up with that guy in the lower right-hand corner it's a quote from his boyfriend that I got book Jamie this song to favorites. That ship Behind the Candelabra

<timemark seconds="4910" />

well didn't they put makeup on him and shit and make them look more like living no but it's still close enough yeah but I think they did something with his chin chin the upper right-hand and left-hand the one with the the guy that actually got the work done

<timemark seconds="4938" />

yeah I look he he made him get plate fat facial plastic surgery so he would resemble Liberace so you could is face look like liberace's boyfriend he wanted him to look like himself he made his boyfriend look like a crazy is that part of the movie Liberace takes away that's right. Load was amazing in that movie that's a great movie from the pits of all time about that movie I like to get Joey Diaz high and make him watch it again he should read he should rebirth that video was so good

<timemark seconds="4988" />

I don't do that shit anymore cocksucker the problem is you would have to he would have to want to do it you really couldn't talk him into doing it and he would also have to be enthusiastic about it again until I have to want to tell the joke bit so it was the story was he was watching the docudrama that is it you can't eat pussy with asthma Behind the Candelabra by Joyce is this it is podcast that's it was my fault that's why I don't go to Mexico if you don't know then

<timemark seconds="7868" />

I mean his they're circulating all over the Internet it's it will just get way more traction as time goes on cuz it's so fun yeah he's a killer but all the politicians saying that like they don't even put out the shows there like we got do but I got duped by oh my god dude. Sarah Palin they all came out doing Stolen Valor did you see that yeah what was that about because he said that he was an injured Soldier IX Sarah Palin one I don't know which one it was

<timemark seconds="7910" />

things the Sarah Palin when he was a disabled veteran but they were saying you write Stolen Valor something about all this year yeah they're trying anything to discredit it but you tell me a sketch character can play whatever they want I mean that's that's what is that's it that's a no I mean if it's a character in a fit if you can play a war hero in a film why can you play the opposite but born on the 4th of July Tom Cruise okay what's so funny Showtime counter-claim here with the

<timemark seconds="7954" />

Showtime counter Sacha Baron Cohen Stolen Valor lamia the counter because it was made public information over the past week about the character of Billy Wayne Reddick Jr Ph.D performance what is the counter

<timemark seconds="7970" />

I think they explain what happened it's her to said that they didn't misrepresent themselves they probably thought he was someone who is disabled and he stated that he is not and uses a Mobility Scooter to conserve energy in addition Farrakhan never present himself as a veteran the US military former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin during booking process or during the filming of her interview. Conservative street artist replace the billboard near CBS Television City complex in a Los Angeles with a doctored image of Cohen in a wheelchair wearing an army t-shirt the new billboard was capped caption Sacha Baron Cohen walks away with a hit and a touch of Stolen Valor

<timemark seconds="8012" />

a touch yeah he's trying to say that's a slight it's a slight at the at the troops okay but how dare you not though so fun server country truly sick my fault isn't it isn't personalities all you want

<timemark seconds="8025" />

the delicate balance balance in Phelan Road on disrespect of our US military in middle class Americans fiacco and she's so stupid and middle-class Americans fuck you you're disrespectful disrespectful trick and middle-class Americans just get as many people in there as you can for Via Collins foreign commentaries under the guise of interview question foreign commentaries what does that mean under the guise of it she's so dumb could you imagine that lady almost became our vice president but you or what what the fuck would they think it was they have could have one she was the anchor the fucking suck that pussy but the idea that they thought that was a good idea while she was a pain man she was such an easy fucking pawn it I don't think so I think she

<timemark seconds="8085" />

think she was used as this little this good looking cute item a female smittle American gun shooting she was a pain I think she was a play and it went too far it was almost like they didn't know what they had gotten himself into that I think they thought that was a could have been the angry like that have been brilliant or fucking the dumbest shit on Earth she was the governor of Alaska right they figured hate she's a good-looking woman she's the governor of a state she's a mom when she shoots guy I'm disabled child she had all the things that was like wow what a good PR push it was a disabled child while she was running. Had had a disabled child have had a disabled kid was a veteran right or right that were like perfect for America so crazy it was so cool when they started interviewing are so what what newspapers do you read all of them all of them I can see Russia from my front porch

<timemark seconds="8145" />

cross I see Russia from my porch for like sound bites for for American but Trump does the same thing she just doesn't listen to the Paradox of History Malcolm Gladwell and they're talking about this the Sarah Palin incident and Tina Fey actually said that and everyone thinks that Sarah Palin actually said it came from the SNL spoof and completely got attributed to her and she is also ruined that whole thing that she could see it from her front porch. She did say something about she did say something about Russia going to come through Alaska she did say something Preposterous like that if Russia they would go through her rights Snopes which isn't the best place and I'll be looking things up I like they have the article about it and says that this came from an SNL spaghetti

<timemark seconds="8206" />

Palin's comment on being close to Russia right she said what I Googled I Googled Sarah Palin Russia from my house and in my house say it Palin on Russia close to Alaska she did say something she did say something to that ridiculous I said something ridiculous enough to make that sketch a fly in Jets dummy and take 3

<timemark seconds="8237" />

how to cheat but I think that was just you know remember I can keep an eye on them from here that's the statement comes on the heels of her publicly during at press at some point had said something about it was just kind of like how when Trump said something once he repeated over and over like does it start to drain the swamp wasn't once I was out I talked to Tom Arnold last night I know, I was backstage with some crazy shit I don't want to disclose anything but he's he said there is a tape of him and word mean repeatedly I just made you a face like I was surprised at that for some reason

<timemark seconds="8297" />

advice rice bodies yeah and he said people are turning on him left and right because he doesn't have loyalty to those people that are around him so apparently those people are turning on him left and right and testifying and you know giving up evidence and information like everybody realizes the sinking ship we were talking last night I saw the news yesterday about the call that Colin has the tape and he said the Trump knew about it and that's supposed to prove the collusion so yeah yeah yeah yeah he's at work what does that mean that I may not know about the meeting with Russia as a sitting president to be impeached before you can be sure

<timemark seconds="8357" />

is that happen do they just have another election do it again this is a thing Hillary's been ramping up the publicity lately big town almost like she's ready to get back in there cuz she recognize cuz there's so much going on to try to people trying to bury him dude pencil be scared to me man that's scary I need a Democrat out there it's not a compromise is completely corrupt person has been embedded in the system forever and might have killed a bunch of horrible I think everyone that you would want to run wouldn't think that's how I was feeling what a nightmare gig

<timemark seconds="8407" />

200 Grand a year to be to be what is a 250 with Trump will pay yeah man it's a it's a terrible job now terrible job and it should be a job that many many many people do and yet you want persons involved in the economy ecology environment everything military chicken play God you're playing God's the Puppeteer everything that doesn't make sense or computer Village

<timemark seconds="8445" />

yeah it that would come that would collapse as well as two would get mad control all the crops you out of control all the weapons in control all the all the laws you get out of control it even a micro-level the weird thing is while he's president can he start parting people who has had the knee did he ever decides to Pardon a bunch of people while he's president if he does that what is it still good if they put him in jail

<timemark seconds="8474" />

if he pardons while he's in office then there's that then their scot-free but are you saying after I don't know if he goes to jail I Don't Know Jack Johnson which is like yeah that's not really going to help Cat Stevens still not part man Peace Train still not finished Susan Wright he part did he pardoned Cat Stevens don't know I'm saying that but what is Cat Stevens in trouble for the United States and Germany also wanted death for Salman Rushdie Google on the Mexico to watch Cat Stevens concert can get them down in Cabo is that true look it up wanna look up Cat Stevens tour dates cuz he went he

<timemark seconds="8534" />

I'm being followed by a Moonshadow Moonshadow Moonshadow dirt or did you imagine if we went to see him every fucking fun have your fun piece of the events currently booked a tough time

<timemark seconds="8555" />

I think he did it cuz you needed some money how tall is he didn't have his publishing rights or something like that I lost money so you want to tour try to get some checks got some chatter and then went back to the mosque all that cheddar bought some hummus pass it around. It's a musician that a, can't do like go back and do all their old hits yep and still rake it in between the Beach Boys then

<timemark seconds="8585" />

they can still go on tour and then drop of a hat and make a ton of money they still do that shit fucking their big show you their John Mayer the John Mayer handsome guy that hangs out with Dave Chappelle from doors with the dead heat or ice man get the fuck pussy and deadheads love it love it love it take never Skeptics of the beginning there in fucking love with that guy cuz they like it right Manny fuck the fucking god fucking insane that's a hat Stevens any more absurd

<timemark seconds="8645" />

play some concerts in America in the last couple years Obama the Muslim come back last year the last year he got that left back India wow maybe a couple years ago was before Trump so it's probably one of Obama's last moves in office for sure let him back in fuck fuck the Donald but I got to go within a year maybe won't come back now that Trump president

<timemark seconds="8681" />

I mean for money if I can go anywhere I'm sure if it's your last year maybe it's the last the last year was last year he probably won't come back that's so funny where was he living did it say where he was it doesn't say specifically on the fucking news on the lamp by cat was gone guys in Liberty or some shit fuck yeah compound PP sheets off the dogs trained picking up people from coast to coast of the Peace Train people to believe that Islam is the religion of Peace the Sutherland lot of people believe in that shit so maybe he thinks he's on the path to peace and

<timemark seconds="8724" />

I think Islam is probably like every other religion right there's factions of Christianity they're wonderful people really calm sweet loving the get a lot out of it and its people that are just fucking loons in the serpent handlers those fucking people as Christians the snakes family been serpent handlers since we was Federal we've been apart of the serpent culture it's serpent or serpent people and they use poisonous snakes to answer panhandler's I feel like this is documented that I have in my queue so much shit I'm supposed to watch them just did I'm going to go run some wild wild country I'm only on episode 4 I need to it's good but it's slow at the big chunks of slow

<timemark seconds="8784" />

can we go over this already but that's just them being like

<timemark seconds="8789" />

Netflix Netflix 1/6 I want 6 you want sex sexy Netflix comedy specials just from Just for Laughs it's nothing that bill sent me they can't even they won't even sniff one of my fucking fuck I can't even fucking get near them for some reason Netflix wants nothing to do with me I don't know what the fuck their thing is with me maybe I did something wrong years ago I'm putting out so many specials on like I don't know I think it's too much going on and keep up I really don't feel like there's so much, going on right now or stand up never in my life it's it's overwhelming there's a lot more shit, he being put out than I've ever seen or or not you're coming terms in my opinion terms of like

<timemark seconds="8846" />

just just call me for the sake now of Comedy that I'm like this is no fucking well put together special people to take time for some of these things are pumping them out there's definitely that to his people to take advantage of an opportunity right eating somebody offers you a shitload of money you know we don't really have a set ready they just fucking put it up that's the one thing that happens with people when they start doing movies when you start doing movies around a set 16 hours a day and you don't really have enough time to write and you're definitely not performing ever no way that is a crazy move to be doing all these films and then do an hour special when you barely have time. Yeah they can do 35 push and 30 on fun shit in between and maybe even 30 man because it's not even 30 look like a real Rock and Sock Em robots 30 really knows probably not a back-to-back 30 Buck bang bang bang bang out there Louie said this to me once backstage I think he's right he's like in order to do comedy to really do it you can

<timemark seconds="8906" />

anything else would be the best at what you could do good but to be at your best you really can't be doing anything else I believe this podcast just Talkin at comedy to do a special relationships and still moving and whatever around that is it for comedy it's all branching for it but other things that takes totally away from it because when I go I'm totally disconnected its breath for a while but what about when you were doing acting on I'm dying up here I performed on almost every night I didn't give a fuck I was burning the candle at both ends I didn't care cuz you had to I love you a lot cuz I know cuz I also know who steps I'm locked out of my fucking lose steps I care about acting not as much as I care about stand-up yeah you care about it like yeah it's cool I like it a lot of butter

<timemark seconds="8966" />

yeah acting is like yeah I like it I like it a lot it's very rewarding I'm not I'm not I'm not disrespecting the art I'm just saying it doesn't do the same thing for me to stand up does right but what but if I don't go out at 9 and try to make sure I'm I'm booking shows late not dude you lose you definitely disconnected people and people who do it know who they are they know when it happens sure sitcoms of do it to you too because your own set. They killed it for me man when I was on news radio there was a stretch where I was doing I was just an app for a couple years why I wasn't writing any jokes just doing the same shit shit and I was getting disconnected with the jokes yeah and I'm starting a bomb you hate you hate the material yes he loves he doesn't want to fuck cuz he wants it all fucking day so I don't know where he's finding time to write stuff anyway cuz just like no I just like to have fun because he doesn't he doesn't have any time he's 50 things at 1

<timemark seconds="9026" />

she doesn't have time to sit down and go try to pump out some new material on a plane on the road two shows today that's an hour on Friday and leave the house in 15 minutes a day last night that time and only do it if it's junk but certain people you I am I if I that is the maximizing of the trunk of being like that just 15 I'm going to make sure the 15 is he doesn't have bits though not the same way too funny guy rants Raves and talks to the truck off and improvs yeah but he doesn't have like a chunk on lava lamps and it shrunk on wrist watches

<timemark seconds="9086" />

this not only does he did a couple years ago you know this is obviously no disrespect to Jeff I like Jesse break out of me but what he does his yes that is much more like freeform and he did like a bit and do bits chunk out Betsy's like if he finds a bit it'll be great you know what I mean but he usually just fucking around I watch them in Atlanta we are both in the land of the same time he was just he was not like one of the other Comics it was to do was hysterical for 15 minutes of him just fucking around and then got into like talking about but he's loose also know I mean it one of the funny things that he said was that he's so comfortable with just being funny but I have to tell Andrew Dice Clay he was not disrespecting you dice dice

<timemark seconds="9146" />

this whole rant about fat Jeff giving him a hard time he thinks because Garland was saying that it was Rick rubin's idea to do the day the laughter died and it dices like knows my fucking I do my fucking idea upset he's very happy dice Sebastian weird strange fucking via what's what happened there it was like Sebastian had said something on Instagram about Sebastian stealing is actor doing his shit emulating him or something that's who he is I think you should open up for him right

<timemark seconds="9206" />

and you're not even going to Kiss the Ring a little bit Sebastian's a grown ass man who built his own career completely on his own and brilliantly so you know anybody shit wasn't it that he didn't talk about dies in his book perhaps that's probably didn't do Crux of it I think that's the layers for the Detroit free for old friendships like that that have gone sour maybe it's layers it's that it's one of my fucking dinner party when you get a guy opening for you for years and then he smashing It season out for Easter so she can kind of go anywhere he's really successful but he's also like is weird kind of famous we could like go to the movies he's famous restaurants famous East Danish but he sells out tickets like he's Mega famous

<timemark seconds="9266" />

billboard up it said you know Jim Gaffigan 2828 whatever and I was saying to the, cuz I was with I was like is not funny. Like if Gavin was like walking through the casino there's a good chance a lot of people just wouldn't see him see him but sold out someone go I like going I like going with you to watch out people ask you for selfies my favorite thing is when I'm with Joe in somebody asked me if they can take a picture of Joe that's the look at me for talking hey do you mind to me I'm not his fucking at the bar if you were asking me if you want to converse with a grown man do it

<timemark seconds="9326" />

I'm not your like through line to get the job Gaffigan's doing an interesting thing he decided on his own to not put his special on Netflix because he felt like this so many digital platforms on he's going to offer them on all the other platform so he's got it on Amazon's got it on Hulu he's got it everywhere again put out his special on the bottom it says like available on all platforms I have seen that Amazon platforms

<timemark seconds="9360" />

clean you don't even like I think this is another way of him being like I'm also not group like that as well I think that he made the decision was that there's just so many other platforms available. Do you want to limit it to one of the many on Netflix already you know might be actually a smarter more lucrative move although the access that people have probably isn't as good as using Netflix is a global brand that's the problem with huge but if you have it on YouTube

<timemark seconds="9393" />

YouTube is probably bigger than anything right more people watch that YouTube has a bigger reach but there's way more content on YouTube but who's watching YouTube on television at home and the new Jenner is a lot of kids there. Cuz now YouTube TV is like a big thing but how many in comparison to to watch Netflix and I'm sure everybody watch that ass Netflix at all the songs that ass I would think about the mobile though how many people watch Netflix on their phone a lot when I just did my special they said the people half of people on Netflix watching on the phone I've never pulled up YouTube on my computer I mean I rarely I'm saying I put on my phone every fucking day there's something on my phone that I'm looking up on YouTube yeah that's true it's always always on the phone at the house if I have watching something on my phone and I flick it to my Apple TV or whatever

<timemark seconds="9453" />

4 day to that's cool real cool move how long is it

<timemark seconds="9461" />

70 minutes 70 minutes. Seems like I'm annoying to go to the movies for 70 minutes opening act you fuck cum on your backstage last night we're like you cuz you a lot of guys on the show last night show will like this choking to go long will a fucking Scorsese movies that fucking main room needs a new AC unit though I was I was soaked right it's wet when you gave me a hug when I brought mine was I was sweaty Pig minutes I was totally drenched by the time I got off the money and now they just need sold out two shows in the main room yesterday are showing the fucking belly

<timemark seconds="9521" />

nope doesn't exist social media was saying last night he was like you got understand like just for laughs is going on right now this is a way better lineup and used to go on at the store it was like ghost town ghost town it was like no, runtown anymore August people aren't even coming out now just for laughs you would even know what's happening there still so many bangers in town doesn't fucking matter it's just a weird time where time for stand up best time it's popping yeah you know I wonder what is just so many different it said you can't really have one factor does not just one factor with these the internet for sure is the underlying machine more people have access to stand up comedy through YouTube and all these are the different ways Netflix and then on top of that it's podcast Like Comics get together and people does podcast become a part of people's lives daily lives or drive and then on top of that the podcast are talking about the store like everyone's like the story of the sort of took

<timemark seconds="9581" />

tonight your Cricket someone there tumbleweeds the same kind of talk, talk about the store out the store's romanticise by Comedian says just like that it's that's why when you look at the look at Instagram for The Comedy Store every time they put a line up Reid almost almost every single, will have someone go fuck man I wish I didn't live in XYZ I would kill to be there Wednesday Wednesday night Thursday night for a flight I would do it right now if I could afford it I would kill we have this virtual reality thing the HTC Vive you put the headphones on the goggles on ear plug you feel like you're in the room with that like that would be an amazing way to broadcast and up in your living room fuck yeah you could be at the store

<timemark seconds="9639" />

swear on your fucking couch just standing up a better cooler not cooling being there and I'll be in there but cool in a unique different way I think it's just another ad right like to me you always going to want to live performance cuz we always have in the history of humanity we love watching performance life and that's just another way for people to access who physically can't get there to be there cuz you feel like you're a part of it but to actually beat someone in there in the virtual world that would be just as I mean for people that can't physically be hurting us just as close as you can get this is the best you can get when you're there it's live and I'll just a different kind of thing Noah stand up to me on tape has ever been as funny as it is life you did the best you can hope on the television show Suits you just kind of capture a feel of it when you're doing a special for television what is this is as close to there getting right now holy shit oh this is like a verb

<timemark seconds="9699" />

audience in my cave almost like fake movie theater type situation and they're all watching the screen together I'll look around and see people in the world that's that's fun so you sit down and you feel like you're in awesome seats at the World Cup this is happening at the same time that a couple websites are starting with her calling watch parties where you watch videos I know about friends together at the same time this is the actual World Cup with those goggles on that and you're fucking in the third row look how good that looks too and then look at the Hardrock add so they can put adds up well that's what I kind of start making all their money damn that looks amazing cuz I know you seen a lot of sporting events a green screen on their ads Scrolls so they can change for television mean it'll just be that to be the same thing to do now dopa that be for UFC fights fuck

<timemark seconds="9759" />

Mama experimental things all the time right that they try out then they don't you always use them yes yes that seems like the best one and that we could be in the cage you put a camera on the fucking guy was the referee in the refugee camp to shoulder cams some hip cams to put cams all over them Camp Circle I can make the pride and pride Ace Hood Go Pro in the gopro's yet he would be able to see it from the rap can put those are just a really good cameras that used to be shity the Pretty God damn good now I mean for VR they got to be really good cameras right. They can get it now I think they could probably could do it I bet someone could pull this are GoPros always with that fisheye lens don't like that they're built with the fish eye on it for perspective field of view

<timemark seconds="9819" />

what is the fisheye looks great I think you're trying to recreate your eyes you have on you know you have a hundred and eighty degree or five more than that's the problem everything's gets all stretched out I don't think anyone's figured out that yet too hard like that like what for Kay's is inching towards of Life of live broadcast in 4k is crazy is it 4K is more clear than the human eye can see there's elements to it that are clear than what human I can actually see and they're going higher than 14 mm camera that phone with the red the red the name of it but it's a red so it's a cell phone like with the red the camera the red technology company red may explain Brad that's like a super high on camera they film movies with ins $4,000

<timemark seconds="9879" />

the $5,000 battery or not really but suck it too expensive anyway so this is supposed to take a modular piece that supposed to work with some systems they have coming in the future this like the base of the of the phone might connect to a camera or my connect to a series of other things might be in place I think they actually said this has two cameras on the back so anyway the other cool part of it is to display as holographic which no one's actually seen you since it's a new technology like playback convenience when did you buy it or do they clip you for how much were the same prices of iPhone to 1200 East Truxtun red because it's not me know but they're also getting time short tons of VC investors to keep pumping money to keep that going

<timemark seconds="9939" />

sing its technology it is so far fucking ahead of their trying hard to get the hardware to a place where it works when is it supposed to come out some people not like there might be the testers Out imagine some magical day like then I can tell you but I call you Stacy Francis on the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 comes out it's coming out now parents can have the most storage of any phone the biggest batteries in a 4000 milliamp battery is going to supposed to have the insane cameras this is like Samsung's last hurrah with a note and if it doesn't work this time they just going to stick with the galaxies does the Galaxy S9 did not do well didn't sell well but is an amazing phone but it was too close to the Galaxy S8 it wasn't much different was just like an incremental Step better as opposed to like the iPhone 10 is kind of way better than the iPhone 7 you know the seven and eight it's just like the shape is better the fact that all it has

<timemark seconds="9999" />

this little tiny little Notch at the top it's all screen pretty dope Cameron that would have never been up there. Notch. He was such a meticulous fucking dude has an amazing phone called the mate are or the P20 Pro this is the way the company that Trump is keeping from selling cell phones United States and there was an article here I'll send it to Jamie it was an article that we were talking about this yesterday with dr. Deborah so and then there's an article on I think it's on BG are here I'll send you the right now but they're saying there's no reason why they shouldn't have this phone for sale like this I'm fucking weirdness going on but this

<timemark seconds="10050" />

this one Porsche Design made their own version of it Porsche Design made a mate 10 RS the cut like Rally Sport like their rent I for RC cars like my GT3 RS and they they took away the notch like fuck that Notch language going to have a thin says on the top then one on the bottom can of a notch Porsche Design's like them but that's what I feel about that guy I got mad at a guy that when I said I said they fuck me over on an appointment or something I was being a dick and I know you know if that guy was alive this company will still be doing better and he was like okay that's me that's me it's about the keyboard fucking up hot news smartphone Trump tried to ban dropped its lowest price ever on Amazon but this is the problem is it's the best Cameron any smartphone it's three cameras on the back

<timemark seconds="10110" />

It's fucking amazing 40 megapixel camera but the problem is it won't work on all bands in the United States because it's European design it's not it's not the the bill for the sense only it's only GSM so you can have to use it on AT&T or T-Mobile buy one by one for 800 bucks but it supposed to be the fucking shit and the the the screens amazing be able to jailbreak a minute be like this phone to make them easier to design for the same band so you could buy right now 795 bucks but the thing is it's just I don't think it works exactly the same I think if you have an AT&T phone will see that's a Sim factory unlocked so you can use any international SIM SIM on those yeah but the problem is the radio the frequencies that it picks up it doesn't pick up the same all the same bands that sound like AT&T has or T-Mobile has has not work with Sprint Verizon US Cellular and

<timemark seconds="10170" />

CMA Camp because it's right but the thing they're saying is that even if you get a GSM network like AT&T or I'm have to ask one of the dudes that I know like Scott Lewis from unbox therapy or flossy Carter those guys that do those videos they would know 40 megapixel camera 5.1 was one phone call and dial in the numbers there are so many other ways you can communicate with the people you need to communicate with and still make a phone call the places where you can use that Wi-Fi you also get signal that you could use that phone on the real issue is in the places where signal sketchy like weird rural areas

<timemark seconds="10230" />

doing it for years has no cell service. Just going off of what Starbucks sell Wi-Fi or what you doing all the places you go to when you're in your car driving down the road this is the point you're not going to get a service I can get cell phone service but with AT&T or T-Mobile they would have some service and he's weird areas that's the only place with these phones be a problem is the weird areas in La it would work areas in like there's more problems than just not being able to look after the fucking looking for pussy looking for for how do I look for obscure pussy I don't like pussy where buddy environments

<timemark seconds="10290" />
