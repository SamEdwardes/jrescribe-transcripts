<timemark seconds="720" />

 8 times did you get Avatar depression Sigourney Weaver extra moves went to see Bruce Springsteen's one off on Broadway that night how was that sick he's so good isn't it I got to tell you I'm not the biggest I respect him I love his music I know we became a phenomenon like 72 like when we did and sitting there and watching him be honest and talk to this this crowd and sing songs and play the piano in his truth and then he said something like them

<timemark seconds="775" />

 because it was New Jersey thing with a pregnant pump pricing policy list

<timemark seconds="781" />

 I invented that

<timemark seconds="783" />

 it was so real and so true but Sinatra was from Hoboken

<timemark seconds="791" />

<timemark seconds="794" />

 Auto Parts

<timemark seconds="834" />

 Keith Richards daughters are there all that stuff after hung out with Lenny Kravitz had a nice couple slices with Lenny my bro food in Muscle Shoals right after that recorded the song with no no sick as fuck so good

<timemark seconds="850" />

 that was that was 3 days of this this is a hell of a time line you got going on here and it was the next day passed away like 3 months ago and his son Rodney Hall works the place is called Fame Studios and I sat in a room he took me all over the place and I walked in there like the demo room when you can smell the oxides of the tape we like Percy Sledge Hammer the first stuff I Wilson Pickett

<timemark seconds="888" />

 I'm sitting in the room with him and I'm telling you man I started to cry I cried I weld up three times there just to be in the room I'm standing doing the vocals to brown sugar regular Little Richard's right where he sang I see a picture on the wall but I'm standing right there what is it about that place if you're into Vibes if you're in but you got to Aunt Pat up

<timemark seconds="927" />

 you don't feel good when bad things are going thank God when bad things are going are you going to be in the crystals love you love your girlfriend try to be happy to find the positivity and negativity music and your very favorite thing in your close your eyes that's that's something you can't even talk about your life that was Vybz of those songs Wilson Pickett Little Richard what Greg said he was brother let's do this song so you think it is because all those talented people perform there and they did like Let It soak into the building it is that what it is cuz there's this places that do have like a magic to the most talked about The Comedy Store like that The Comedy Store is a magic to it when you're there there's something about that place it like did it feels like great things have happened that played before you feel it in

<timemark seconds="988" />

 would you feel is no carpet it's just it's in the air if you feel like that was Muscle Shoals is it this is it because all those great artists that perform there in like almost like the room has a memory of it I think so cuz there's some scientist that think that things have memories it's it's a weird impossible to prove idea when you die do you know that you that you're on the table you die and if the table is you're being way that you dial it goes down another one soon Rams it's not real really measuring I believe in that I do too sometimes and my check this out so if one of my favorite songs are you experienced right

<timemark seconds="1046" />

 beautiful you walk on stage you go fuck me these edibles

<timemark seconds="1053" />

 I want to hear girl fuck me are you do my nails and these animals used to do all kinds of crazy shit drug wise I was walking around New York City with John Belushi believe that the spirit of music was think of it this way

<timemark seconds="1083" />

 when you listen to your favorite song you want to fuck your wife I think that spirits and wherever it takes you whatever feeling it is whatever when I went to Muscle Shoals I put my hand on the

<timemark seconds="1098" />

 I felt the room because I knew that Little Richard student fight and fucking front of me Roots rock reggae Funky Music and it was no roots rock reggae Roots rock reggae reggae artist when they put put on the to in shape and I'm in there and they start rolling and I'm listening I got I got everything turned out here Bob

<timemark seconds="1148" />

 walking to the studio I hear the drummer sit down with a drum set is still squeaks hey fart but is he can pick up sticks you hear the bass player

<timemark seconds="1160" />

 background space I talkin to Bob mutton what you fucking would you feel are you feeling today and I'm in the room with Bob Marley so what is spirit if that's not it I made them play that back again for me because I just close my eyes and you're in the room with that money for this early something right when you hear a song a great song from the past and you get goosebumps and just feel inside of you for something you didn't I think it's called spirits because you put you in that place. Mission used I think it's not false exactly it makes you say things you wish you didn't then you go I was lying eyes only fucking around what you can be in love for a moment

<timemark seconds="1206" />

 my friend's cousin sold blow and I saw a disastrous result and I was scared off of it when I was very young when I had some friends that As I Grew Older the head blow problems so I never touched it so you're one of them man that's yeah but I've done a lot of different

<timemark seconds="1238" />

 just joking you are farthest from the Normie well compared to some people it's more that you thought not to do that yeah it just seems like one that I would like too much and then my mother is why I never speed either I feel like I'd like now I can get things done. Coffee coffee changes your fucking skin into another color this is a cold brew coffee coffee coffee is really not that I don't think so really I mean I don't know because I've never done anything like that I just sent you one that it's not that it's actually in the morning is like

<timemark seconds="1292" />

 Kona coffee I love going across the top so dark you can't see through the stream that's when you know you're going on Joe Rogan and going to spew some shit some real shit fucking hot lava hot lava from Kona across the singer it's just going to be used to love you but I'm in this room with all the shapes so if you're a musician You Feel The Vibes

<timemark seconds="1334" />

 recording spot for comedians in oh you guys have a bunch of Performing spots but you also have recording spots we only really have performing spots record in those performance parts for me I just had these on last night fixing the lyrics and when I when you have them on you listen to the track

<timemark seconds="1364" />

 it's just it's something you can't explain not nobody understand that and it's akin to tripping on acid into being drunk and sucking face of a girl making out music into

<timemark seconds="1379" />

 watching your kids be born it's an elevated experience that's why I'm reading this off okay this is this is like a life the reason why you don't have any memory because you probably filled out your hard drive space with crazy experiences

<timemark seconds="1408" />

 you know I have forgotten more than most people could ever remember how could you not how the fuck did you remember everything you've ever done so talk to a farmer about some shit that happen if they remember things going on I'm surrounded by people that always remind me that's good to you have a good team and sometimes I got to be on like live on The Tonight Show right this thing I did was it with a beautiful blond Entertainment Tonight that's the best interview I've ever done because she look me Square in the eyes she's beautiful she asks just right questions it was just perfect and you got to be on those moments

<timemark seconds="1454" />

 do you do miss being not sober ever time sometimes

<timemark seconds="1462" />

 yeah I miss Willie pros and cons

<timemark seconds="1468" />

 that but if I do I will end up doing too much for sure for sure I can't control it it's just the way you are just the way I am

<timemark seconds="1477" />

 I don't want to push it again because when I get that way my kids don't talk to me I get a divorce I'm thrown out of my own band what else I lose everything that's happened

<timemark seconds="1491" />

 enough time for me to finally realize you know what it's not worth it you know I got a beautiful bunch of friends to keep me in line you know I got two sponsors one of the West Coast one of these Coast going to call up all the time and don't come out where they say exactly cuz we don't do that what is it called looking back and take it over to the dinosaur shaped like an AA meeting until awesome stories about getting fucked up when you get sober if you don't if you don't have to continue after care if I go in to a couple meetings every now and then you're going to wind up using again

<timemark seconds="1549" />

 Janis Joplin up there okay 1968 high school she's got Bangles and Beads like this shit on she's she's drinking Southern Comfort and she's using the f word smoking cigarettes

<timemark seconds="1568" />

 choose a powerful woman and she's fucking the power in song just want to cover that on my country album yeah to this day I listen to that song like at least once every couple months just put that in the headphone what songs can do for you in the sixties and what we did was we experimented you know I mean if you think about what they tell us Christopher Columbus discovered America know the bow of his boat was full of booze and he fucked Queen Elizabeth whoever she is she sent him on his way with some money so bring back some countries you think

<timemark seconds="1613" />

 hey buddy where you was at the first person here that's what America wants us to believe anyway so it's kind of like that it's like you never took out my seats I'll Take It Outside In Summer Time right dutiful Greenhills going up and we ride the chairlift Stone as fuck and we got our stuff from San Francisco from Ozzy call him up and go to more colors

<timemark seconds="1652" />

 is Rachel Maddow is going to kill me but that's so it's like

<timemark seconds="1660" />

 is it fucked up in his drugs yeah but you're also it's like I'd love to do Ayahuasca but you can't maybe my bucket list and that's what I'll talk to my sponsor I got this I'm in Maui maybe I've been here too long but

<timemark seconds="1677" />

 over the Honda between Ayahuasca I saw that you were at rum. This place cuz you were there with my friend Duncan Trussell hell yeah you guys together I went back there to silent auction and I know I know what I'm. Season was just beautiful Jewish kid from Long Island Long Island and he became what he did talk about spirituality so I need the silent auction and

<timemark seconds="1705" />

 I bought this and that and this and one of these mellotron type thing that you squeeze box you squeeze in the fingers and play it and when I left there guy comes over you just bought the first edition of his book in his own handwriting you just bought his things called

<timemark seconds="1727" />

 non accordion right

<timemark seconds="1731" />

 fishing according to listen to us talk and chat right in front of you yeah he's a trip I need to meet him before he leaves this Earth dunk and Raves about them obviously have an interest in psychedelic experiences but you who are weary about attempting them at the stage after your sobriety

<timemark seconds="1760" />

 what I love to trip again yeah I would think you could do it and maybe it's just like you just don't maybe it's getting fucked up that's the bad thing like just getting fucked up just getting coked up and maybe maybe it wouldn't be a problem at all are you taking drugs in your fucked-up you fucked up

<timemark seconds="1789" />

 doesn't matter if it's shamanic or not if you if you get high and an estimate weeks that little thing in my brain that goes here I go remember from the 60s with the best of them and it took them down some of them most of them you came through it remarkably unscathed if you think about it thank you God

<timemark seconds="1813" />

 pretty amazing thank you God thank you God think about that one think about that we can talk for 2 hours about times I dish it and almost died I'm sure I could also tell you

<timemark seconds="1828" />

 how many times I took shit and wrote things like

<timemark seconds="1834" />

 listen to this guitar lick that you was playing he did an interview with you yeah tell you how it is fucking sleepy we play these riffs and I come down the hallway because I see a horse

<timemark seconds="1848" />

 but as I see it we were up in New England and he was playing at a place and I mowed the lawn my my my my parents place and I quit my last band and I was fucking a little who saw her I was crying I was in no more bands the dream is over he drives up in an mg we go and is playing that night I swear to God this happen and so we decide to move down to Boston but all in an apartment because I thought I knew why those bands didn't make it but I knew in my heart that if I had a bro dab and I can make it a key like The Kinks Ray any of those bands I have to have you

<timemark seconds="1893" />

 you guys were really tight they feed off each other each other exactly so we move down there I got really tight with Joe I hear him could get we get social at Social. Booze Boone's Farm I mean for every song you've ever heard Sweet Emotion

<timemark seconds="1921" />

 there's 20 I got lost in the Aether no phones no cell phones I would record that shit and so anyway that's what that's where these songs came from his stuff would come out of my head while I was

<timemark seconds="1948" />

 like Sweet Emotion

<timemark seconds="1953" />

 she sure use that place where you get it or go to and give her a ride so many routines for sure when I got sober I started writing even better shit I go in the room with 4 guys and say we're going in the right ahead we're going to stay in this fucking room until we do until we can see each other smell

<timemark seconds="1986" />

 leave in 7 hours with a fucking song

<timemark seconds="1990" />

 good one and one that would live way past all of us check that shoot out what does it feel like when you when you did have these drunken Stone moments when he came up with the song like Sweet Emotion or river and then I'll send you listening to it on the radio how how fucking surreal is that what is that like

<timemark seconds="2010" />

 I remember we used to go up to first of all most of our first stuff was recorded down in Hell's Kitchen

<timemark seconds="2017" />

 what's the sad feeling right you can do it really professional in my eyes some of my dear friends behind it done recorded a song that you think

<timemark seconds="2608" />

 but that's how easy it is what I've done that many times do you miss the raw no changing no adjusting no one can of course chicken like what I do that on pink

<timemark seconds="2627" />

 I'm down in Florida

<timemark seconds="2629" />

 I'm at the Marlin Hotel

<timemark seconds="2632" />

 I'm living in the room I'm sober as can be when I say that that means

<timemark seconds="2639" />

 when the sun went down I turn the light on bright star bright pink obsession

<timemark seconds="2650" />

 pink

<timemark seconds="2652" />

 even though question

<timemark seconds="2656" />

 pink

<timemark seconds="2658" />

 I'm going to see your lover

<timemark seconds="2661" />

 pink what you will discover

<timemark seconds="2666" />

 so I did that for until the sun came up I turn the light off

<timemark seconds="2674" />

 so use that time for tonight. Everything at night I was just so tired I feel stoned and I would write

<timemark seconds="2684" />

 and then I would take the lyrics of pink I wrote 7 versus which only need three but I was 7 Aerosmith's biggest secret only / 14 on an album pick the best out of 21 and you get you hit on you be doing your Edibles Whatever Gets you off and then I'm free fucking incredible things through you come back and if you want to you can do all three if you want at the worst one is great cuz you sure

<timemark seconds="2725" />

 you know what's funny is you know how to make that chicken out of weave something together so I put an issue before Pro Tools you think all day.

<timemark seconds="2736" />

 And so the guy that we're working with

<timemark seconds="2740" />

 sing that course at first

<timemark seconds="2745" />

 I'm so weird to have course I sent that first he just put that verse in in Old World vs go and I listened back and I went fuck we got such a great song here I don't use it to manipulate what your vocals there's something about your vocals that you wouldn't in handsome if you fix them like you have a raw Soulful quality to your voice that if you fucked with that digitize that you'd lose all of it I mean I'm sure they can do some things of the real artist with Pro Tools and and move things around I'll still sound amazing but there's no errors in your saying you don't say any crack or pop it's just going to be better I feel that as a person doesn't look for Perfection you just look for beauty you know Perfection is not beauty that means it's an unattainable thing Chase it and you can get excellence

<timemark seconds="2805" />

 look for the Perfection and stuff at her ass and Perfection some of my first songs I want some Janis Joplin I want what the fuck is Post article beautiful beyond belief and having drinks come on over come over some coke with 10 bags of cocaine

<timemark seconds="2860" />

 I appreciate it I'm watching this one in that one I want to crawl up her ass I heard it's amazing facts about it when do they give you morphine humanism in pain all the fucking time A lot of people are buying all the time so hard for people they don't make enough money they vote for Trump whatever the fuck's going on right now I can't figure it out but a lot of people like I was when I was younger yeah that white picket fence in that and the one in the wife 18 years she reads your two kids I'm a fucking paid

<timemark seconds="2923" />

 so what's the best thing to do

<timemark seconds="2927" />

 is that the best thing to do though what is the best thing to do when you're in pain we have to be a little bit elevated

<timemark seconds="2937" />

 you listen to people like Marianne Williamson

<timemark seconds="2942" />

 I don't know who she is she's fucking brilliant do you know she has Jamie his but I think when I got sober I started listening to tapes I get on the treadmill in the morning I'm cuz I I can't even I don't even feel alive unless I'm out of breath that's what I get for being a musician I lose a pound a day sweating with Aerosmith right up there with standing next to fucking Joe Perry really the last of the real rock stars that used to the Crosman

<timemark seconds="2980" />

 when I get text messages from I'm like holy shit you fucking a text when I saw him in the beginning and I knew he was at you something special I knew he was that he's just like certain people that have a sound you know Joe has he absolutely has a sound you know as a sound Gary Clark jr. like you hear Gary Clark jr. play guitar okay that's Gary Clark jr. if you know there's certain people that have a sound Joe most certainly has a sound it's like he's expressing himself through that guitar in a very recognizable way

<timemark seconds="3019" />

 tell what a fucking combination that was his guitar and your voice and sing on the second album I get it I wanted to put some fucking soul soul in my voice I know I had it

<timemark seconds="3051" />

 I don't know what was you know like from Nat King Cole walked up behind her and I went chemo, stare stare at ever to meet you at my daddy and here's what I want to sound

<timemark seconds="3089" />

 I want to show more like Joe Perry was playing singing really sweet and nice and sweet and nice and I were sitting around smoking a big fatty and Mark Lane Road manager in Spider-Man

<timemark seconds="3116" />

 I'm looking at that was a sentence he spoke to me

<timemark seconds="3131" />

 we all live on the edge of town where we all live in a solar dancer translated

<timemark seconds="3149" />

 and I put the headphones on later cuz I'm The Lyricist and I wrote The Melody I see you when I heard Jose band I thought I'm going to take my dad Vic Talerico who went to Juilliard in New York in the Bronx 5610 Evelyn avenue 6G Department

<timemark seconds="3176" />

 I'm a part of the piano when I was to my dad practice everyday on a Steinway so who lived between the notes show me saying I love you name is Joe I just left Joe's

<timemark seconds="3190" />

 broken love Joe Perry fucking love

<timemark seconds="3193" />

 so put away so I took my melody don't you know what I hear when I listen to him playing album and you did that affectations of how you called of your voice digit after you heard it and you listen to it like people talking about it did you decide to change it for the next album I did just go away for a minute tonight yeah I love it when I do that

<timemark seconds="3226" />

 the melody violin for my dad and then listening to the music we listen to Frank Sinatra and Janis Joplin and Village frogs who are the first ones to put on the back of their album lunatic vagina song The Mothers of Invention wow

<timemark seconds="3255" />

 I thought singing really like my dad taught me in the notes and write on and note c d e f

<timemark seconds="3266" />

 not only that but if you don't put inflections into it. No feeling in right no meaning

<timemark seconds="3279" />

 whoops Ryan

<timemark seconds="3287" />

 you say it but you have to feel it can't be something you're trying to feel it's going to be something you actually feel that maybe I think that's off to him

<timemark seconds="3299" />

 the way he plays guitar practice at 90 fucking not out if you sitting in a chair and the fucking shit the couch going to fire him he's playing this riff and we turned it into a song this kind of stuff happens so much and he did it away to me fucking and obviously you know and I can't tell you any other way than that magic and every inch of the way the reason it doesn't feel like I'm 70 and I don't feel the time and it feels like yesterday we just started on my stage I'm singing the same fucking song again same way same feeling same looking same people different people

<timemark seconds="3353" />

 different people but I'm singing the same song do you know the guy that's looking anyway so to answer your question second album sounds a little bit more raunchy more into Joe's guitar and I think we found our sound second album

<timemark seconds="3699" />

 singing nobody knew you was a human since my mom passed away and she said she said

<timemark seconds="3710" />

 you as a person but you decide that American Idol was the best way to show that I thought that's what was the first thing was what else do they have the good sense to offer me anything I got the offer from Marti frederiksen

<timemark seconds="3729" />

 2000

<timemark seconds="3736" />

 10 11 11 12 I got to sit next to J.Lo and Randy Jackson that motherfucker beautiful guy CJ lunch a little beautiful I need whatever we need some incentive yeah yeah we would do all three of us and I think that's missing now but

<timemark seconds="3769" />

 offer you this

<timemark seconds="3771" />

 wake me up at gym and you're all set up with the whole crew and you these microphones in a 12 foot Mike's hanging down over your head like this and 12 cameras in high-def up your up wahoo

<timemark seconds="3790" />

 and 5040 people a day will come through all these 50 16 or 17 year old little trollops with red lipstick on push-up bras going to get out of here you got enough to need them sent to me from each other and sometimes I will get so it was just after the 41st and 50th person but that's what people like though there's something about American Idol we like really talented people but we also like people who are delusional and we trust me it took me about 2 weeks to get into it because I told myself I'm never going to tell some young girl who can't sing but she can sing get the fuck out of here like that other guy

<timemark seconds="3845" />

 you know what I'm listening to music besides which it's country and I like country I don't say that

<timemark seconds="3853" />

 that seems not rich but that's awesome he's a weird case isn't because he's not a singer when he is I said Sunday's breastfeeding baby what's the saying maybe she wants her baby sick and she's sitting at the on the bed and wants to sing to channel told her she can but you shouldn't have it in you mean that's his stick right his dick is to be a mean guy and people like that they like that mean guy she doesn't want to they got me a couple times ago disingenuous

<timemark seconds="3900" />

<timemark seconds="3932" />

 Dallas North Carolina and Buckingham Palace and the fucking you see the moon going to look at the place where was just enough to bring it up when we finish tomorrow we leave but it was fun like that and it was a good payday so when you're asking about how some out yeah and I was made fun of for doing that or who made fun of you for doing that. Think it was a smart thing you said that's one step under Ninja Turtles Joe keep in mind when I'm alone by myself I went

<timemark seconds="3974" />

 Dizzy Wright who do I talk to myself

<timemark seconds="3977" />

<timemark seconds="4019" />

 on my way to the Four Seasons in the back in town finals back how we saw this house I thought set where I didn't know who lives there but I thought somebody in the Grateful Dead Jerry Garcia I kept looking at it just a piece of beautiful house but it was ridiculous you know I don't have that

<timemark seconds="4052" />

 you don't you don't have that when you have an you share all the money plus management publishing and then that contract you sign when you're stoned right

<timemark seconds="4062" />

 what is a clear a beautiful so I'm looking at my notes help me show

<timemark seconds="4075" />

 I want to talk to you about aliens we can do whatever you want man we're good man

<timemark seconds="4092" />

 this this right here is really important she's getting so when did you decided that you

<timemark seconds="4105" />

 what the fuck

<timemark seconds="4116" />

 your sweet man you're sweet too

<timemark seconds="4120" />

 what format to talk truth not only that when people watch your show was too full of shit and I'm sure after a while you know the truth they know that too before they knew you were just the guy behind the microphone what do you sang songs that touch people and move people for each each you just put it right over there

<timemark seconds="4152" />

 oh she wants it in stock

<timemark seconds="4155" />

 okay I'm sorry but even that like this having a conversation like this it's this is not enough of these out there where it where is now you know now there's more of them but for the longest time but you would never be able to have this kind of conversation because of the same people that would tell you to turn it up a notch on American Idol that do producers around and be people trying to fuck with things at either direction this is my butt at the studio notes we have notes as what we want you to do Stephen and I want to talk about this and stop doing that thing where you keep singing people that want to hear that anymore. We want you to do is that and for you to speak your mind like you do your truth

<timemark seconds="4197" />

 can I have someone across from you to speak your truth in their words in any language they want and I'll be edited or audited is is that you couldn't say ass on the radio

<timemark seconds="4213" />

 if you can't now I think you can now but I hear a shithole I'm on CNN Don Lemon good for 3 weeks and shitholecountries people get used to swear you're getting used to people just speaking on attitude that getting used 2 uncensored video they're going to use the things I was just words password for sure the words are just representative of thoughts and intent right just noises it's like the best way to describe at what's going on in your head is use all the words Bismol use the ones that are really coming out of your head don't hold them back and give me some watered down version of what your real thoughts are so I have to decipher it and see where they put it through a filter and try to figure out what is Steven mean by that

<timemark seconds="4274" />

 I got so angry the way things were going about that I want to say

<timemark seconds="4279" />

 6 years ago that I quit management I got my lawyer deal with Pope equip management of management management the band

<timemark seconds="4290" />

 and they're also going there God bless one of them passed away rest his soul he's a good man and the other one didn't have a lot of good things to tell the band wrong direction all the time

<timemark seconds="4302" />

 and now my band is with my management we're together a fucking game so 6 years ago I would talk to people I go you know what fuck you I'm going to roll the next week I'm going to fucking say your name I just built a house up here I come home and I don't water wall and you know it's me and come and go back so the water wall wouldn't rolls down and wouldn't spray on the bridge

<timemark seconds="4337" />

 I get there and then I heard the tire and say fuck Tyler

<timemark seconds="4347" />

 that's the kind of stuff I want your fucking toes pal

<timemark seconds="4353" />

 the manager story is a story that you hear if I just heard it from a friend of mine to tell me about a her managers give a shit advice and she has dropped them people in management to give shit advice like how to change out of town

<timemark seconds="4367" />

 tutuapp know the answers and they maybe they may be right the rest of them know how to play the game if you read the book it's easy management yeah sweet-talk them it's a hard thing to be a manager's it's too tempting management it's even harder the hardest thing is direction to look at people's feelings right now with her about why they're about what I should do this interview what interviews to do which ones to do which ones not to do things not to do well don't do any one where they're going to stop in four minutes you know those Tonight Show ones we have to make this book for me I'm so fucking pissed I wrote In My Head bother you

<timemark seconds="4424" />

 give me did I write lyrics what did you do last night the guys will give me shit for not writing lyrics are finishing a song they're upset that you're writing a book where should we put the song Don't you lay back down

<timemark seconds="4445" />

 and she has got to go and write the lyrics if I don't

<timemark seconds="4451" />

 what the fuck man and I say well I'm trying to get my wife pregnant okay I have life

<timemark seconds="4460" />

 you know what happens you get a lot of pressure on you and then because they did that I went and wrote Walk This Way the lyrics had it in my bag finish the whole record gotten a fucking cab went to 351 West 321 West 43rd

<timemark seconds="4483" />

 and I fucking went white I left to learn some again the whole album

<timemark seconds="4492" />

 and my producer goes we doing Walk This Way tonight like I did the Night Before lyrics I wrote them on the wall and that's what happened but low but you know I love the way you left cigarettes and maybe when you're stoned on coping nothing's funny that's why I avoided it speed to get you where you want them

<timemark seconds="4532" />

 for me and how it looks when your shaking my head stem cell shots put my shoulder today some new process they do I'm in serious pain right now that's why I'm shaking like why would you just got me 5 hours ago I've been moving like a

<timemark seconds="4568" />

 Gabapentin Gabapentin Gabapentin work out let's go quickly I wrote this and I wrote you a little honey sweet that you were very sweet we would have to do some men just remember the less hair I got the Morehead you get the more of the less hair you got to Morehead you get that makes sense love Steven Tyler ever so thank you man I really appreciate that if you put me down in the worst way I still love you I didn't do that and I work

<timemark seconds="4634" />

 Trails you've left in life I love you I love you too I just told you I've been a fan since I was a kid you're fucking Monumental I love you I love you so you want to tell me why you so big for that know martial arts but my shoulders are have got some issues from some years of abuse in tears and some minor arthritis and this one's been apparently I had some sort of a separation on this one sometime in the past I didn't know. Terry I've had some great success with stem cells Cabool Missouri, how do you say it was like more

<timemark seconds="4691" />

 weather anyway stem cells out of my headphones and they put it in my knee replacement well though it was wrong with your knee valgus it was like this from an ACL reconstruction doctors don't know News 4 years old is so awesome videos everybody it's it's all about meniscus it's about the amount of cushioning and whether or not they do a good job replacing the ligament but I had very good doctors on my left and right knee shot at the doctor Cattlemen good for you man

<timemark seconds="4741" />

 98-94 I have a buddy or 93 actually I have a buddy of mine who had one done though and his knees really fucked up to the point where he is about to get a replacement I actually got a hip replacement on one of his hips because of the damage in Disney I know I couldn't take Vicodin and percocet or any that's how long ago to get your knee replaced

<timemark seconds="4776" />

 6 years ago so you need to get your right one done because what's going on with the left knee never responded except us the right side if it pinches on the nerve that comes out like that I can't be doing that you talk to other doctors cuz what they're doing now with Regina regenerative regenerative able to replace meniscus

<timemark seconds="4837" />

 regrow shit hang on there's they're able to do some shit now where they can they can fix things they've never been able to fix before and every year gets better and I'm pretty close to The Cutting Edge of the stuff I've had a bunch of doctors on my podcast talk to me about it but take Aleve dr. Neil Riordan who does a lot of work down in Panama that they can't do any United States yet and he did Mel Gibson and Mel Gibson's dad was 92 at the time and on death's door in a wheelchair now he's a hundred and he's walking around yeah go go to Panama my knee so it's fine moves good conscience I can't go around like I do

<timemark seconds="4891" />

 how do you know in this other I'm just saying that I don't know what's going on with the doctors I've spoken to the longer you can hold out the more likely you are to never need surgery that they're especially when it comes to Replacements that they are able to do a lot with hip replacements now with Regina King and stem cells you can wait because what they're able to do now is different was going to be able to do in 5 years and in 10 years you can wait the more likely it is they can regenerate tissue yeah they're doing all kinds of crazy shit now it's themselves

<timemark seconds="4932" />

 that isn't to telomeres telomeres yeah she longevity cheat sure and he said that people that are like conduct silly decisions of silly silly silly people that are able to tell me why Chelsea longer or shorter so I love I love today I love what's going on I'm going to look into this please do we'll talk afterwards I'll give you some names and numbers of shit to do look up

<timemark seconds="4975" />

 but so so MMA looking at it

<timemark seconds="4982" />

 what's savings what you're into right now MMA for me I'm at anime music Something in the last year with my lawyer and it's called I'm sick and fucking tired of getting beat and ripped off for the songs I wrote in the seventies and where's the money it's not even a joke and now that there's a form at which digital see the less of a joke you want to fucking go breaking these buildings to take a gun and shoot people because

<timemark seconds="5021" />

 give me things like Spotify and things like that right there right there song

<timemark seconds="5030" />

 50 years ago 20 years ago Publishers take the money we make on Toys in the Attic Millions right they keep that money for year

<timemark seconds="5046" />

 to put in the bank they keep the interest right after they keep the interest of course about having finding out managers by the first 3 rows of your shows and and get the money from the fucking promoter

<timemark seconds="5068" />

 in your pocket brought to them in a paper bag you want to fucking go there that what it does that would happen

<timemark seconds="5076" />

 so they buy the first three rows and then sell those tickets for the first 3 rows

<timemark seconds="5093" />

 see you later and they're just for depending upon those people did not tell you

<timemark seconds="5104" />

 yeah I mean who's going to show you what happens you only find that shit out afterwards if you're going out with a girl that says I'm the one that brought the money back to him ocean

<timemark seconds="5119" />

 so you found somebody found out that way so let's keep it like that

<timemark seconds="5127" />

 and I would love to get angry and shit about stuff I love it

<timemark seconds="5139" />

 you think when you get sober you're off the drugs here isn't there wasn't bullshit

<timemark seconds="5154" />

 the reason you drink

<timemark seconds="5157" />

 all the reasons that you drank they come out even more no more Angry definitely got to learn how to what how to manage that anger for sure it wasn't true about I guess over 88 so you do the math

<timemark seconds="5193" />

 cuz I had enough for those years right out of my fucking mind 81 82 83 then I had going to kiss you don't miss a thing came out right around but it's good to you we went up to a place we've never played so what I was going to be for point I really want to make strongly no cell phones no MTV nothing I used to buy these plastic stickers and I got the world or these guys rule 1325 Comm Ave and ask him for 20 bucks and I will put them on people's windshields pissing the fuck off to the really sticky and I put them where you throw the money when you go through a toll booth

<timemark seconds="5251" />

 I put them together Aerosmith

<timemark seconds="5256" />

 I was just sat around you no hookers

<timemark seconds="5262" />

 should stains who's running man I used to be in a band and we work will you call harassment for a while and so there was another Aerosmith before I also heard from the drummer some really short lived Club thing as an idea so maybe there was a abandoned perform a couple of times call Darrell's baby for all the names I heard and thought that's a good one I didn't see anything into it

<timemark seconds="5304" />

 I have a snack of looking at someone and not necessarily remembering their face but it but I feel you it's like stupid how to explain this

<timemark seconds="5318" />

 tomorrow

<timemark seconds="5320" />

 transmute

<timemark seconds="5325" />

 I definitely don't don't let me know. I'm going to show up but you're kind of I kind of feel things I feel when I remember I said it's got this disease

<timemark seconds="5348" />

 I don't know what's Brad Pitt as a disease he's got this thing we can't remember what it is sorry man I have a disease I can't remember you cuz he probably meet so many people that you 15 years ago Starbucks remember dude you still have proper food for dinner that is developmental prosopagnosia face blindness yeah bro that's what I got

<timemark seconds="5394" />

 large-scale but I took me like 25 years ago you know I just don't remember filming in bars numbers. What is the number that you can keep of intimate relationships like friendships and close ties with people that you know when your head is somewhere around $150 they think is roughly about the size of tribes that people lived in back when we were developing the human your jeans really take a long time to change and they think that we essentially have very similar genes to people that live roughly 10,000 years ago 10,000 years ago that's essentially how people live their lives in the small groups of people 150 200 people Max and that's that stuck in your head back and it was another million people here a million years ago there was another million people if you don't think so what do you mean the last ice age

<timemark seconds="5452" />

 don't you think I don't know why you can't remember if you believe that what do you believe I feel you feel long time I watch Graham Hancock sense that there's been periods of you know massive loss of life and you know cataclysms and comets passing by

<timemark seconds="5494" />

 I believe that were you ever not watch the unacknowledged what is unacknowledged you got to watch that one okay you got to watch your neck. What is it you got to watch out of knowledge is that that Steven Greer movie it is an industry is in people wanting to get mystery solved the great mystery of is there life out there and nobody has an answer is 3 Oz show for Syfy call Joe Rogan questions everything and before that show I was a hard-core believer in a lot of wonky conspiracies like Bigfoot and Aliens I just love them cuz they seem so interesting the most plausible human beings as recently as a hundred thousand years ago is a real absolutely real animal care and there's they found fossilized bones these things and they think they found teeth from an apothecary shop in China

<timemark seconds="5557" />

 there was a real animal who was a gigantic bipedal hominid it was somewhere around 8 to 10 ft tall so this thing lived at the same time people did this is probably the reason why there's a myth of Bigfoot that is one point in time this was a real thing what about the probably not sure you know a lot of people tell me about most is a business must of gave it to his wife I said don't put this out until I'm dead did you not even speaking any of that was real I think two men are you saying that I've seen a lot of a lot of military people that say they've seen crazy things and it's entirely possible that they really did it's entirely possible but it's also possible that they're crazy it's possible that they love attention as possible.

<timemark seconds="5617" />

 boards possible to the schizophrenic and possible that they have memories that they've concocted over the years and enhancements gotten them attention and it's putting them in documentaries and get them interviews on television programs but that there's no evidence you know end of the problem with all these people was there all have the same feeling about them and they're not this very few of them to come across as rational and objective most of them, crosses there's something wrong there's a there's a wires that aren't connecting have you talked to them about other things in life but you had a chance to talk them for a long period of time sit down with him for 3 hours ask them about ghosts and psychics and all kinds of other shit they almost all believe in that stuff is there believers they want to believe in nonsense but it's possible to not just possible it's a hundred percent likely is alien life out then like 20%

<timemark seconds="5672" />

 Franklin movies horseshit there's a lot of those movies that are horseshit and that guy you know some of that Sports shit like there's a little baby that they had found an aborted fetus or trying to pass it off as an alien baby for a long time but they have generally can you tell me about the link between we are hominids we are primates and we're just the most advanced Prime at the real question is how did we get to be so much more time that's why I asked you found fire in our diet change and then the stoned ape Theory which is a very fast human beings found site suicide in mushrooms and that through the use of silicide mushrooms which in low doses increases visual Acuity produces these

<timemark seconds="5737" />

 static states that it might have helped us develop language and communication and creativity and this term was the reason why the human brain doubled in size of her. 2 million years which is the greatest mystery in the history the fossil record they don't know why they did it what does a very clear path between two lower home with you here shortly here I'm going to be yours go as Woods deer animals in Ice Age that took part that took a thousand years beginning to end

<timemark seconds="5786" />

 so and we don't know what will cause it while when the ice age exist we have to remember that some parts of the world are experiencing the Ice Age and then humans thrived in Africa during Parts the Ice Age and there's a there's a lot of human beings that live all over the world the real question is where they start most likely from Africa but they could have possibly started from some of the places to we're starting to learn that that's what people who learn that too but I mean mostly just people traveling but what you really learn from is archaeologists knows the people you learn from and biologists people that really understand the human genome the really understand the differences between people that emerge from China versus people that emerge from Western Europe versus people that emerged from or Native Americans I mean there's so many different types of human beings that came from different climates in their their bodies of all from these places and is real science to that you're not going to get that from this goofy fucking documentaries he's goofy fucking documentaries are basically a bit

<timemark seconds="5847" />

 in the businesses is a bunch of people out there that want to want to know the answers again what is the truth and so you could provide was aboard the secret UFO I saw the magnetic controller that makes us travel Cosmos in Bend time and space it's like a wormhole and I'll say a bunch of science he sound and shit but there's no evidence does nothing when they talk about there's nothing what's David Wilcock music guy says that he is The Reincarnation of Edgar Cayce do you know that did you know that your horse famous psychic who never really figured out anything most widely by scientist in skiptrace I don't know I'm going to wait with everybody was stoned but I think it's awesome

<timemark seconds="5900" />

 mushrooms on opiates Loudon last hundred years in Japanese

<timemark seconds="5921" />

 do all Japanese have the same eyes shapes

<timemark seconds="5925" />

 yes they do there's a reason why I will come back after mating with anybody else she stayed on that buy land that that that's not sure

<timemark seconds="5940" />

 but when you agree that our lives across from Asian look very fairly similar ideas variations in the similarities that was similar to take millions of years I always finish up by saying I didn't see it I'm dying to see UFO II that will make clear shit like you know

<timemark seconds="5970" />

 the song I will call back when Cain was Ava waiting for the it was about a mother Shipton ship way before I knew anything about UFOs did you ever see anything when you did psychedelics when you did drugs or get what he did not show anything that wasn't there? I'm not the kind of people that are out there and neighboring Dimensions that you really not capable of accessing them but that's where the real alien slow I don't know man but I just know that all these people that are pushing it they're all they all have this fukery involved in all these people it's a real problem because you want to believe right you want to believe it is a general out there that seen his face if it's under the mountain tell me about it Mr General and he goes on a lecture not be going to pay money to see him and he's in a documentary and there's a lot of those people out there man it would you do

<timemark seconds="6028" />

 the missing link between if you talk to biology and how did I just woke up but they do they serve and they have all three of us that were like us there different from a long fucking time ago they have those in the size of the brain that did happen but they know what we used to be there are simple hominids that were or rather ancient hominid that are very similar to human being and they slowly became even days and there's also they keep finding all these different versions of human beings like it wasn't just human it wasn't just Homo sapiens and of course there's neanderthals and but there was that with the one from Russia what was it called that was in that move that book of hominid

<timemark seconds="6088" />

 what it what is that I can't remember the word starts with a d but it's one that they found very recently very recently find a Jimmy yeah here it is

<timemark seconds="6102" />

 Dennis Sullivan Dennis Dennis Sullivan denisovans hominin extinct species of sub or subspecies of archaic humans they found in the 1970s by the Russian paleontologist Nicolae old off so there's been a bunch of different forms of human which is the most successful form of human the idea that is just alien DNA connected with people it's sexy it sounds fun but there's no evidence I hear you are an ancient thing that slowly figured it's way out we became better seeing things would get better at hunting we became better harnessing fire

<timemark seconds="6144" />

 why people don't believe it's real they build a believe in determinism they don't don't even believe it free will is a natural thing I mean I've heard Sam Harris argue it pretty successfully that there is no such thing as free will that you are an accumulation of your genetics your life experiences all the things that have happened to the people you come in contact with and that that forms Earth's history and how much of your behavior is shaped by millions of adoring fans of people screaming and cheering you on and singing songs that move people into blurry change Generations gives people Goosebumps when they hear I'm really all that stuff is shaped who you are and all that stuff changes who a person is and who you are now in the way you behave now is in many ways shaped by your life experiences as much as it is by your genetics and you wouldn't be this person if you had lived that life and the decisions that you make from this moment on right now leave the studio and have a conversation with someone will be shaped Italy

<timemark seconds="6207" />

 part but this conversation in mine will be my my conversation with you this is what the idea behind determinism but I've heard it was really argued to Me by Sam Harris the most successful

<timemark seconds="6223" />

 certain monkey certain breeds of monkeys with Smart Ones been all those I love them cuz I'm a bit of a wait a minute now then I'm going to pass that actually believe the chimpanzees have entered the Stone Age this is one thing that's being considered now that they've started use of tools on a regular basis. They think that they're learning from each other and they think that if if they are evolving in real-time processing will take millions of years but they have entered the Stone Age so they think that who knows with of a series of mutations natural selection with a bunch of different things happening what a chimpanzee is today most likely it will be a different thing in 2 million years course it will at least intelligent animals they're going to experiment with things.

<timemark seconds="6289" />

 macaques off and you stone tools have been living in the Stone Age for 50 years so for 50 years these animals just 50 okay. You know about the terms of primatologist 6 episode of my behavior so what do you think about when you look up in that look at I don't know the answer that's where I got my girls don't know the answers either it's all cut up in Mount Machu Picchu butt up and I'm not talking about yeah Advanced civilizations that have been wiped out by cataclysm as fuck yeah we were here

<timemark seconds="6344" />

 Nickelback free miles in the mount yeah there are incredible cakes this week yeah that's where my head goes in there she goes, I don't know but you know what you're talking about Muscle Shoals your might be a similar feeling when a violent encounter happens in a house that might be what a ghost is would have ghost is might be this thing you can't capture you can put in the Box can't wait on a scale but you get a feeling when you're in a place where something horrible happened and you could feel it it's not it's not impossible to imagine that that's the case and Rupert sheldrake was the guy that I told you believed that needs a scientist need some people argue against it but that he believes that things have memory and then it's impossible is possible that even this table has memory all the people that ass at where you sat I think it's got hot water

<timemark seconds="6407" />

 you can never get rid of water for the billions of this is terrible right now strangled

<timemark seconds="6424" />

 people with their heads back then murdered Wars billions Coast hundreds of thousands of people murdered or outweighed by the positive experiences for the most part most of the time life is pretty good most the time life is not filled with war life is not filled with cannibalism and murder and animals eating you most of the time so most of the memories accumulated in these individual areas were probably positive but sometimes the idea behind like haunted houses and shit like that is it something so extreme happened at the remnants of that experience are trapped in the very fiber of the room

<timemark seconds="6478" />

 I don't know if I believe it but it's not outside the realm of possibility I don't either thinks about it so unbelievable murder was taken place don't tell anybody and lets him family sleep in there see what I said thing about MMA I want to ask you about that talks about her Bentley and Rolls-Royce is a Ferrari sold out 5 * 6 years ago and she's beautiful blonde lawyer woman

<timemark seconds="6534" />

 Speaks Over Here Brandeis or somewhere she's my lawyer was my manager for the longest time and I decided to go to Washington to start flashing this shit around saying you know what's fair and what's the musicians on getting paid so I just can't Forget market value royalty rates and treatment for music creators in the digital era did the digital era right now is where they can play my music Sturgill over are the artist fuck me I got enough money I'm happy with a smile on my face I get to do Joe fucking Rogan well I'm happy you just recognizing custody

<timemark seconds="6592" />

 you got to hear this well today too they get they have to give up merchandise they have to give up a piece of their concerts sales that they give up everything to record sales call 24/7 or some kind of bullshit like some crazy thing where they have a piece of everything you do with used to be all yours right like we used to do concerts back in the day used to get paid for your you got some money from the record but then you get all the money for the concert but unless we were all managers 9010 means we take 90% out 2% to do that that's different right is not a different thing well the record company gets gets publishing

<timemark seconds="6650" />

 left to the artist which is usually Littleton Smokey Robinson my dear friend I love you seen phenomenal this fucking guy went to the digitales

<timemark seconds="6679" />

 so you owe me $250,000 with proof

<timemark seconds="6682" />

 music being played what the fuck Smokey Robinson I hear my music music music is covered by thousands of people the guy we knew legally $250,000 was owed to him okay okay he was offered 12080 was said if you don't like it suicide or Smokey you don't have that kind of money so far is it to Smokey Robinson doesn't have that kind of money so we so what that Smokey Robinson should be just wealthy like a king at all he's one of the happiest guy in his wife is the sweetest

<timemark seconds="6734" />

 and maybe he's a child attain something you and I don't recognize yet or the mass media but he's got something he's rich

<timemark seconds="6743" />

 I want to come see him getting paid actually for songs that's really fucked up so what did you decide to do the National Music Publishers Association and dinner we went to his money is going right off of window in Knoxville the artist these new artist getting nothing so we decided to do something for the first time songwriters will have Representatives overseeing administration of mechanical licenses and administration so someone's now at least not only a complaint for someone watching you do in fact legally own 250,000

<timemark seconds="6793" />

 and for the first time so this is something we're trying to get passing the next don't you think it should be there though I do think the reason why we're not on that we're not on Spotify and the reason why we're not on it cuz it didn't make any sense they were like we want to put you on it but it's going to be great for you Mike how's it great you guys going to make money that you guys are making money you don't give us any it's a it's okay that whole streaming thing is this weird smoke and mirrors song and dance they put on you're going to be a part of something big like what are you selling all you sell is artist work you don't have anything to sell can I spend the artist get paid so little so where is the money going because there's all these what's generating at motherfucker motherfucker

<timemark seconds="6847" />

 1909-s it was saying what I was saying yesterday yesterday yesterday but yeah yeah there's been some fuckery there's been some legal Fakhri and you know it continues he created man like you but I love you seems that I'm always thinking of you and what the fuck did you come up with like I said

<timemark seconds="6892" />

 he says well I was sent to New York to do some kind of publishing thing with lawyers and I was sitting in a hotel in New York before I went in and I thought I wrote those lyrics somehow

<timemark seconds="6906" />

 young black man went songs 50 years ago in New York with lawyers probably white just saying

<timemark seconds="6917" />

 he was put in a situation where he has a magic he has a magic he wrote a paper I don't like you but I love you seems I would maybe the hate that he had for what was about to happen created the opposite I don't know but that's what he told me you said I was down there waiting to meet my lawyers and I hated that prick take all the albums Nuno Bettencourt make all the albums that fucking you know the Rolling Stones ever did put them in a box over there now all my friends can have access to that box if anybody can do it songs and Ricky's father Rich old fuck Bryant but what's happened is is it's become the norm well it's Best Western movies

<timemark seconds="6976" />

 dealing movies it's illegal like if you get caught with a bit torrent account got a bunch of movies on there and you letting people download them you can get prosecuted let me ask you why so much for that and not for somebody songs is the thing with songs to but it's just not as common right Jamie is at the case of people have been sued for having tons of songs right have a good day for sure it's just songs for whatever reason after Napster became something that people think that you should just be able to get for free here and then you get me some music in Spotify and what's the other one Spotify what's the other there's another one right now

<timemark seconds="7022" />

 they put something out this is what I'm saying to you Napster came along and then things change do you think that's when the music business really got crazy that's when they really say look we got it started we're not getting money from record sales anymore when the record business they can do this shit digitally we got to get a piece of that concert sales we got to go to pick up peace those tickets we got to get to merge we got to get everything we got to solidify who got to make it still make it a big deal and then extreme the money Grabbers from artist just rethunk tit and streaming seems like a more hostile version of it aren't benefits of vinyl

<timemark seconds="7084" />

 you see that I haven't seen see documentaries on whatever

<timemark seconds="7088" />

 21 shop for bit what was really going on and you know they can fucking take this and that was so easy all the money was coming into them they were making deals with a nasty parts weren't even signed to the label but you hear the other side of a manager and the manager at a secret teal run Sony but you hear that about boxers having shity creepy managers you hear about musicians comedians you everything it's okay right now listen to this I wanted to come lawyers and say

<timemark seconds="7141" />

 my uncle used to say oh really another way when I would say things to him like

<timemark seconds="7152" />

 what about these lawyers they took on a case they find out after a year-and-a-half case is still going on grand jury really murders girl

<timemark seconds="7167" />

 please my love speak the not allowed to speak because that's when OJ Simpson was was was was in the end of every month can we got meetings and make sure everything was right beautiful and cool or in Germany has already feeling going around be cool yeah I pretty good I feel like he wasn't fuck yeah are you going to know it was really cool guy he was asked to go in the toxic psychosis out of his mind

<timemark seconds="7212" />

 so much cocaine speed

<timemark seconds="7214" />

 oops didn't mean to do that pulled out who had toxic psychosis I don't know you tell me I didn't know about you're the one who brought it up myself no no not going to make sense I'll tell you why

<timemark seconds="7245" />

 because he was one of those AA gurus

<timemark seconds="7250" />

 that the court system saw as somebody that if he says Joe Rogan he was on drugs and I didn't know what he was doing. But you can't do that with murder nobody's going to buy that toxic psycho say cut your wife's head off

<timemark seconds="7271" />

 he was on drugs or some kind of law lawyers were looking to find someone to say that if he was caught I never did

<timemark seconds="7281" />

 oh my God he's arrested but I came out right when you do too much cocaine or too much speed too much anything outside history domestic abuse is very violent tattoo for their bunch of times and it could have just been that he went crazy and just stabbed her but she was going to blow I don't know why I would have to anyway so

<timemark seconds="7312" />

 I said what does it mean I don't know how I got there and more AA group a guy that knows about drugs and says hey he was the kind of softens the blow the money so that I apologize to John McCain because if he does

<timemark seconds="7355" />

 doesn't everything else you said then coming to light you tell me that's a good point but you know that he never apologize about anything or what he did now he's fucking lawyers they tell him don't no no no no don't apologize now because if you do it's going to shed light on all the other shit you said about McCain listens he wants I don't think he's going to listen to any dessert 72 year old billionaire and I don't think he listens to anybody I think he does whatever the fuck he wants that's what I think that's the only thing that explains his T-shirt that he says all the time and it's a complete guessing Okay

<timemark seconds="7405" />

 any over there

<timemark seconds="7410" />

 work for his wife for 7 years and then I got her

<timemark seconds="7415" />

 and I was sitting on my bed can I get a phone call but song do you say the Donald or just I'm just kidding okay

<timemark seconds="7432" />

 forget the phone call to pick it up I'm sitting down and messages because we offered money to do shows one else for a minute just to get a 2-0 castle in on PS4 causes not campaigns

<timemark seconds="7459" />

 he did anyway that I had to sue a good dinner to send him a letter of cease and desist I've been through that shit so I kind of know where lawyers live 91 what the fuck okay maybe he's not listening but when everyone is saying if you just say John McCain is a fucking hero if we don't see John McCain is a hero how do you expect any young people that will never join the armed forces for everything they do when they take presents I jump what the fuck are you doing Donald said something crazy like I like soldiers that don't get caught

<timemark seconds="7503" />

 soldiers okay, cuz they want to exactly so I just tell you that he's not saying anything cuz he's being told what to do and see I think he just does whatever the fuck you want the lawyers tell him Steven says you can't play Dream On is like fucking him

<timemark seconds="7524" />

 what did he found a better song I found a better song Sultan people it's a c I see how it is what it is this isn't he a present for this time though this is the time we were talking before the show about people trying to drag people down and social media and there's so much hostility and people looking to be angry and insult this is the time for that in a lot of ways unfortunately she's opening something good choice I think it's our choice as president I think we can respond to this bad feeling that we have about those kind of actions in a positive way I think that's where there's an opening then the opening is for people to recognize if I can live forever you can't insult people into the grave and feel good when you're dying it doesn't matter like what makes you feel good right now something makes you feel good to constantly be knocking people down and

<timemark seconds="7593" />

 getting on the grave you probably have terrible person nobody wants to be a terrible person who is the majority of people don't so I think the majority of people going to recognize that this path is a bad one but it might feel good in the short-term to say fuck you yeah go to make America great again with a fucking like the world on fire but I think after while When the tide goes in the tide goes out people going to realize that this is not the way to go I hope I hope we going to learn that I think the world is getting better overall I think this terrible moments that have always existed throughout human history but I think overall if you look at the pier to time we live in now you know and Steven Pinker Road great big book about this and there's a lot of evidence give me his number call Steven up I'm from Boston I met him in his lunch he's right after what he called crab

<timemark seconds="7648" />

 when it's time for lifting up that's going to happen I really don't think it's right now stupid shit goes on like this the more people going to recognize that this is not not good to make people feel good and it's not even good for conservatives the conservatives just like it because it's their turn now and they're turned they got a bully on their side as the boys going to kick ass but even they going to realize this isn't the way you would admire people to send the way to go cuz there's a there's a possibility to be kind and conservative the same time these this is possible. I think things are bounce out you know only time will tell

<timemark seconds="7705" />

 no that's the best way to be I think so you definitely don't want to go into the whole that's what I'm saying. We look at the music business

<timemark seconds="7716" />

 music business Run free and good men die I fucking hope this is going to do this again I hope we opened our doors here we did we have some conversation it's possible that UFOs are real but beware of people to tell you they know the truth because people want to know the truth so the people to come along and tell you I know the truth too many of them are full of shit Stewie it's an easy con game that's my thought on
