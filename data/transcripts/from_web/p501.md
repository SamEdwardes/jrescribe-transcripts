it's early in the morning to the music

<timemark seconds="370" />

The Joe Rogan Experience

<timemark seconds="379" />

fieldgreen fired up in the a.m. it's very unusual bit it up around this time so do a podcast around this time Randall Crossing quite a few years back in Atlanta blew my brain open with a bunch of crazy talk about asteroids and just all kinds of crazy shit sacred geometry you're a very interesting cat and you got a lot of cool stuff to talk about so I'm glad we finally got you here on a podcast you were requested guest on my online Forum so folks know about you to know about your work

<timemark seconds="419" />

all these years of off-and-on anonymity and now I'm suddenly I don't know if I'm ready for this Joe I think this is your time to shine all right Joe coming from you that's all it requires we had a great conversation we've been trying to figure out a way to it to repeat it online how there's videos of us actually having a part of the conversation but it's this music in the background we're at the comedy club in Atlanta so you first remember what we first started talking about but you blew my mind when you start talk to me about the Holocene crater and that this pretty distinct evidence that you don't there's been more than one events on this earth besides the one that everybody knows about the 65 million year ago one with a big chunk of Rock Hill

<timemark seconds="479" />

Yucatan and kill the dinosaurs but there's been a series of those and that these things may very well be responsible for a lot of the cataclysmic stories that are in Epic of Gilgamesh the Noah's Ark story all these different fables and tales of ancient Traditions may be based on these cataclysmic disasters and now I'm since we've spoken Sciences started to validate a lot of your theories and ideas even more substantially the discovery of this nuclear glass that they find all throughout Europe and Asia

<timemark seconds="516" />

tell me about all the stuff did you catch the thing about a month ago I think was in the New York Times most of the major newspapers or group of former NASA astronauts and scientists came out said we were new evidence was showing it we're probably somewhere between 3 and 10 times more likely to encounter things than anybody had previously been estimating even 5 to 10 years ago it was pretty major article in most of the mainstream media encounter things by getting hit by something you remember what happened on February 15th of 2013 right what happened on February 15th was that what was really interesting about that is because everybody interested in this sort of thing we're kind of looking to the sky anyway because this was the closest pass of a of an asteroid coming within 17,000 miles of the Earth at the same time this object totally out of the blue came in and it's

<timemark seconds="576" />

hold it over Chelyabinsk Siberia so it was very interesting and coincidental if there are such things as coincidences that here when were expecting us very close flyby of an asteroid near Earth asteroid coming a thousand miles of the earth suddenly unexpectedly here comes the second object and explodes with the force of about a I believe it was about a 50 kiloton nuclear weapon and of course it had exploded quite High about 20 I believe 18 to 20 miles in the atmosphere and so it didn't kill anybody however the thing to bear in mind is if that object had been just a little bit bigger or is he been a little bit dancer or the angle of approach have been a little steeper instead of 1600 injuries or probably could have been

<timemark seconds="636" />

1600 or more casualties at that point I think the world but it was basically just a warning shot it seems to me that our knowledge of asteroids and meteors impacts and things of that nature art art actual experience on is based on the short window that we called human history which is for the Earth such a brief tiny blink-of-an-eye I like to point out there you know when you say human history were talking mule 4500 to 5000 years ago generally I think most historians of ancient history will usually say that the emergence of cuneiform writing in the Middle East marks the beginning of official recorded history

<timemark seconds="690" />

but you got to bear in mind that we modern humans have been around a lot longer than that right now but as far as the hard evidence closest which which is what I like to refer to which means skeletal remains skeletal remains of humans that as far as we know are basically no different than than modern humans if you put flash on him and dressed him up in modern clothes and they walk down the street you wouldn't think they were anything unusual modern skeletal skeletal remains of modern humans are now dating between 150 and 180000 years so when you think about that you know compared to what we actually have a record of History a record of history is 120th 125th 130th of the actual time that we humans have been here. Could be that modern humans have actually been here much longer than than a hundred eighty thousand years we have no way of knowing at what point we moderns first appeared on this planet

<timemark seconds="750" />

but when you think of a hundred eighty thousand years compared to let stay in round numbers 5000 years it means that there is a lot of the human story missing and the thing that's always intrigued me is that given the assumption that they would have had the same intelligence is us the same day they got the same brain case size the same cranial capacity so one would assume that with brains as big as our modern brains they were able to think they had four thought they were able to plan ahead presumably be passed on from generation to generation and accumulated learning but

<timemark seconds="792" />

what we see is that there's basically no record to speak of of what people were doing culturally and in his lead a lot of scientists to assume that for all those tens of thousands of years and hundreds and hundreds of generations the people are essentially living nothing more than a subsistence kind of hunter-gatherer existence but what they haven't taken into account is the extremity of some of the global changes that have occurred in in the interval that we humans have been here and as we go through our discussion today and I will pull up some images I think you'll begin to get us an idea of how extreme and how sweeping some of these changes have been and why in the aftermath of those changes we wouldn't shouldn't expect to find a whole lot of hard at cultural evidence

<timemark seconds="848" />

because what you're hopefully we can do appreciate is that were some of these events of the scale and magnitude that have happened probably a dozen or more times in the 150 or 200 thousand years that we've been here were those events to occur today 10,000 years from now archaeologists would be sifting through the through the rubble looking for any kind of evidence that we had ever been here and that's the thing we have to do to get into our Consciousness you know my guess if there's any any application is the work that I've been doing is that we certainly can't take our present position for granted it seems very difficult for us to put into perspective numbers like ten thousand or a hundred thousand or million universes been around allegedly for 14 billion the Earth is 4.6 billion those numbers are so weird

<timemark seconds="908" />

stir they're just like I know 4 billion is more than 400,000 but both of them are alien you know what I mean it's like I don't think we can really wrap her head around the idea that 10,000 years is such an incredible length of time that if you left the car out for 10,000 years within you know three or four thousand it would be absorbed completely by the Earth Joe within three or four centuries really oh yeah I mean if you look at it I mean steel body cars III member very well as a kid not far from where we lived there was a auto junk Auto graveyard and all the teenagers around there who were racing cars back in the fifties and crashing them up and everything they seem to end up there and it's a kid I used to like to go in kind of hang around here and play and some of the old cars but they were already after sitting out there for 10 years I mean already well on your way to to rusting away I mean once that process of oxidation begins to take place it hit it accelerates

<timemark seconds="968" />

not far from where I live in Atlanta that was an Old Iron Bridge that had been built around the 1890s and it's no longer there but by the ATM by the 1980s it is almost rusted to nothing in within a century it almost rusted to nothing yeah metal does not last long when exposed to the elements there was an interesting series or shows a few years ago I think it was had to do with the idea of what is humans just suddenly departed what if we took humans out of the equation what would happen to all of the infrastructure left behind just under normal kind of gradual istic change that we're used to within you know the last few centuries yep shot if it was his to ten thousand years from now

<timemark seconds="1013" />

it's pretty much gone you know I mean if you look at the the the great buildings that make up all the Metropolis metropolitan areas now of the world most of them are steel frame structure and they're going to closed in in a ask and that will keep the elements out maybe for a half a century but without maintenance I mean you know that the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco is constantly undergoing maintenance because if you stop maintaining it immediately it starts Ducane immediately it starts rusting and

<timemark seconds="1049" />

interesting if you think if if we suddenly if humans left the planet 10,000 years from now some some Interstellar anthropologists arrived what would they see that would indicate that we had been here what what do you think would still be left after 10,000 years there's actually two things that they named in this particular program

<timemark seconds="1070" />

but you can guess one of them out Rushmore Mount Rushmore good good yes yes that's one of them and of course the Great Pyramid the other one and that's it you know everything else is gone wow when you when you now begin to factor in the thing that I've been basically working with his the idea that we have these intermittent I called nonlinearities discontinuities within the normal orderly progression of things the catastrophes if you will superimpose a few of those in the process and basically five thousand ten thousand years from now you're not going to find much to show that we'd been here that's incredible structures like Gobekli Tepe which is within the last couple decades in Turkey which is really throwing giant monkey wrench into the timeline of the hunter-gatherer transition into the modern agricultural City

<timemark seconds="1130" />

we're at we're in a weird State because people started they got these things and go back to Tempe with a completely unknown structure until this one farmer or her daughter had found a stone and start arresting and then realizes he's huge Stone pillars of an unknown civilization carved with three dimensional shapes of these animals some of them were there aren't even native to the area so incredibly confusing and purposely covered up 14 to 12 to 14,000 years ago which means that who knows how long it was there before it could have been several thousand years old when they decided to cover it up but it was purposely filled in an enormous area purposely field in somewhere around 12,000 years ago could it have been purposely covered up in order to protect and preserve it could be right that we were hoping what they were hoping rather than someone like us would come along. Awesome never not me

<timemark seconds="1190" />

come along and uncover it and then go whoa what's up what's this all about like maybe they knew that there were going to be moments in time where these things happened these impacts these asteroidal impact and that there needed to be some sort of a way of of keeping track or some sort of a way of preserving

<timemark seconds="1214" />

well that's that would probably be one way of preserving it for sure and the other one thing would be it's just like you only man you mentioned the two things Mount Rushmore in the Great Pyramid of course are both built its toe which is obviously much more durable than steel or metal the fabricated materials that were we're making today even Plastics even Plastics are going to degrade over a few Millennium but if you want to preserve something for Millennia make it out of stone and making Monumental and you know we're looking at it sounds like you just made an interesting point about it could have how much previous to the to the burial headed actually been there and you know it's difficult to date stoneware you would date snowing is either you can use various some

<timemark seconds="1262" />

cosmogenic ways were when you expose Stone to Atmosphere it's going to accumulate cosmic rays which caused changes within the stone that can actually be measured but if it's buried it's not going to be subject to cosmic rays so that you can't do that that way you would probably have to do is date find some organic material within the soil Matrix Matrix of material around it and date that material but even their see that's not going to tell that's only going to give you a minimum date so another words the structure is there for who-knows-how-long they decide to bury it they bringing the material and bury it and if some organic material is in that soil it's not necessarily going to be indicative of the age of the stone structure itself it's going to be in the indicative of the time at which it was very how did they determine that it was buried at 12,000 years ago was it the uniformity of the depth of ice and made a study of Gobekli Tepe

<timemark seconds="1322" />

I'm hoping that when I get a chance to hang out with Graham Hancock I'm going to get filled in on all the details of that I don't know specifically about that other you know my audience I do suspect that you know it's going to rain today in is probably very old and seeing Indonesia a lot of the Monumental stone work that we find like a bail back where you have these monstrous make a list probably go back to pleistocene times and when I say place to see and I'm talking about the. From like ten thousand years back to about two and a half million years ago the time during which there has been this succession of glacial ages and interglacial ages and you know you mentioned the term policy we talked about that Holocene is shamefully the modern geological Epoch we've been in this Holocene Epoch for generally they say 10000 years in rough numbers although it's becoming much more precise

<timemark seconds="1382" />

dated now you'll find a lot of references in the scientific literature that says gives a date 11.6 or 11600 years as being the onset of the Holocene which is an interesting date for me because I know if you've ever read Plato and his accounts of Atlantis there's two of his dialogues prettiest and tomatoes in which he describes Atlantis and he gives the dating in near at least on three separate occasions and he always places that you know there's this whole six at the whole lineage of the story goes back to Solon who was it in historical character of an authenticated historical character who lived it about 600 BC and he was a lawgiver and poet in Athens and do the political pressures and stuff he went into a 10-year Exile enduring a 10-year Exile he went to Egypt and it was there that he presumably heard the tale of Atlantis from elderly Egyptian priest

<timemark seconds="1440" />

and he was told and came back and then told the story to his grandson who told it again to to several individuals before they actually got to Socrates and Plato who presumably wrote it down but what is interesting is that in completos account he he gives the dating for the demise of Atlantis is 9000 years prior to Solon exile to Egypt or given that that took place in give or take a decade or two 600 BC we go back that's twenty-six hundred years ago Okay add that to the nine thousand years and we've got eleven thousand six hundred years ago now crying to Plato's account he says that it was shortly after this great war between the atlanteans and the Proto Athenians that there was a tremendous cataclysm and Atlanta sunk beneath the waves

<timemark seconds="1495" />

he's giving that date 11600 years ago we now know from the scientific record that 11600 years ago there was a major climate transition and there was a catastrophic warming Spike that was associated with a mega scale meltdown event of the great ice sheets that were covering North America it was this event 11,600 essentially jerked the planet out of the depths of this Ice Age it had been in for thousands and thousands of years with that melting you had a rapid rise of sea level so it's very interesting that the date that he gives is precisely now the date that the scientists are given for this transition from What's called the younger dries I think Graham has mentioned that in some of your

<timemark seconds="1552" />

interviews with him that the younger dryas which was this climate spasm that ended the last ice age so if we look at the chronology of events around 26,000 years ago we were in the latter phases of a what appears to have been an interglacial. Not too much different from what we're in now around 26,000 years ago the climate rapidly degenerated and the mass of glaciers had expanded during this what they called The Final Phase are or the lake Wisconsin they refer to it because initially they were looking for this evidence in the state of Wisconsin so they they named it that this last final phase the lake Wisconsin show run twenty-six thousand years ago we see the the launching of this Final Phase of the Ice Age the lake Wisconsin then it around 13,000 years ago is the dates are now giving it there was this enormous spasm of warming

<timemark seconds="1612" />

and it seemed to be associated with rapid melting and the first real rapid sea level rise okay what happened is after a very short interval of time the climate snap back into the full depth of glacial cold now what had happened was to go back to 18,000 years ago this was the coldest part of the Ice Age I mean is bitterly cold. Of time

<timemark seconds="1640" />

do I live in in Georgia was the forest That Grew there were like the forest you find in Canada now you had Tundra up in Northern Kentucky and Southern Idaho tundra in Southern Southern Ohio excuse me so it's a really really different climate and once you got to Northern Ohio in the northern United States where New York City of Chicago the Great Lakes The Dakotas follow that was under this massive ice sheet thousands of feet thick when you go up into Canada over Canada the ice sheet was up to two miles thick Rich think about that too thick of ice and it reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean and from the northern United States as far south is the 45th parallel all the way up to the Arctic Circle now that is a drastically different world bear in mind to that was that much ice piled up on the surface of the land sea levels which contributed the water that

<timemark seconds="1700" />

form that I had to go down and it's now well-documented the sea levels during the death of the Ice Age were at least four hundred feet lower than now which which means the planet we're basically exposed now I live in Georgia if you go out and stand right now in the beach like at Cumberland Island with beautiful Wilderness preserve you stand there on the beach

<timemark seconds="1724" />

if you were suddenly transported back to the depths of the Ice Age would be in the middle of a boreal forest beating a Northern Forest with spruce trees large trees Alder trees the kind of trees you find out in Northern United States Canada that area the beach would have been anywhere anywhere close it would be another 50 7500 miles further to the east because as the sea level drops what happens in receipts right and so when does Final Phase of the Ice Age came on sea levels begin to drop and so what I did was it exposed all of these shallow Marine ecology bet that rimmed all of the continents to the atmosphere and basically would have caused enormous ecological Havoc welding within the Millennia or so before expanded and hit now growing out so now off the Eastern Seaboard of the United States they constantly will find the remains of tree stumps and four

<timemark seconds="1784" />

the temp in groin are 14 15 16 thousand years ago now the ice begins to melt sea level begins to rise that's important to realize that if we look at the Modern civilization is evolved what do we say it's where did the first city show up don't aren't they mostly trading cities that show up off their port cities they show up along the Confluence of rivers they show up where rivers meet the oceans they show up on the on the coastlines okay so if you had major cities during the Ice Age is Graham it's pointed out there now 400 feet underwater

<timemark seconds="1818" />

you begin to appreciate when you begin to really look at the history of our planet what you realize is it it's been just almost unimaginably Dynamic this an alteration from a from a interglacial to a glacial age is an extreme

<timemark seconds="1835" />

process and so I guess the upshot of it is said you went when we look now after the climate record that we have in hand now which is been pretty much reconstructed with a fair amount of accuracy back to about 400,000 years and these are primarily based on Ice cores extracted from Greenland extracted from Antarctica extracted from Mountain glaciers and most mostly mostly Antarctica and Greenland know when you pull out that I score it's layered you think think think of cutting down a tree and looking at the annual layers where you can actually count the number of layers in a cross section of a tree log and you know how old it is right well it's very similar in in an ice core you got layers and because each year there snow that falls it gets compressed into Fern f i r and which is the transitional phase between snow and glacial ice and it eventually gets compressed into glacial ice and

<timemark seconds="1895" />

you look at a cross-section of the ice core you'll see these fine layers in their right so they can go back and they can look at these layers they can count the layers and there's a lot of things going on in these layers oxygen Isotopes prefer ascertaining climate changes because oxygen Isotopes are a function of temperature and we have a graph here will pull up in a minute we can actually look at that but what we see is that the climate is constantly oscillating back and forth and when we look at the policy going back ten thousand years and then we take that comparatively we go back two hundred and fifty to 400,000 years we can now begin to reconstruct these intervals of glacial periods interglacial

<timemark seconds="1941" />

and here's the thing that should be sobering to everybody on the planet today as we think about climate change and all of this because obviously it's constantly in the news and all the longest interglacial. Now on record for at least the last quarter million years the longest one the longest unbroken. Of interglacial warm is the Holocene the one we're in now we've already exceeded by several Millennia the longest previous. Of interglacial Warrant

<timemark seconds="1974" />

I don't hear them talking about that I don't hear Al Gore talking about that I don't hear anybody talking about that in mainstream media but it's hard scientific fact yeah we would be getting our pants weigh more if it was a global cooling then if it was a global warming let me tell her we're going to last couple of thousand years. Of global cooling have not been Pleasant times. Of global warming is when we see human population expanding when we see cultural advancement when we see life spans increasing when we see infant mortality decreasing periods of global cooling are when we see populations going into decline when we see life spans diminishing you know we had a. Of global cooling it began between 5:36 and 5:40 a.m.

<timemark seconds="2034" />

it was this. Of global cooling that launched but we know of the Dark Ages and this is now been well-documented by dendrochronologist Mike Bailey is one of the effects that the leaders of this who's been looking at the climate changes of the last couple thousand years has preserved in the tree ring record between 5:36 in about 5:44 ad we find that Forest growth in the northern hemisphere just came to a stop and one of the consequences of that was this was associated with a global cooling and for multiple years running their agricultural collapses where because of the cold and The Damp that came on with this historical record interesting because you read some of these accounts that were preserved from that. They talk about weeks at a time where they couldn't see the sun they talk about when it did show up it was just a feeble imitation of itself

<timemark seconds="2094" />

talk about you know years with no summer basically so what you had was succession of crop failures that led to people becoming malnourished once I became malnourished their immune systems became weakened and in 5:40 to 8 about 6 years after this well-documented transition occurred we had the onset of the Justinian play which wiped out the third the population of Europe and it took 300 years to recover from that and it didn't we didn't recover from it until the climate shifted again and we went into what is known as the medieval warm. In the medieval warm. Was the time when the Scandinavians were farming on the west coast of Greenland where now it's perennially frozen

<timemark seconds="2142" />

and for about the next couple of hundred years the climate was according to some researchers and some scientists as much as two degrees warmer than now and you think it had to have been warmer if if they were farming in Greenland where it is now frozen ground it had to have been warmer and one of the things that happened with was with this warming you had an expansion of the the growing season and you also had the latitude belt at which viable farming agriculture could be practice shifted three to four hundred miles north of where did for the first time in England actually had a flourishing wine industry which didn't exist previously and it is only existed until recent times because of genetically modified crops is now allowing them to grow grapes

<timemark seconds="2195" />

where they haven't been able to grow wine grapes until we go back to the medieval warm.

<timemark seconds="2200" />

So what happened was now there was a lot of food for people to eat right people got healthy human population begin to increase right we begin to accumulate wealth we begin to to carry on Commerce and trade after the 300 years of Dark Ages we're learning receded into the into the monasteries and life was very unpleasant very short very brutal very unpleasant now we had this warming. Okay with the girl with the expansion of Agriculture and the Abundant food supply and prolific Harvest people were getting strong healthy again stature and it's been well-documented it during the two or three hundred years of the medieval warming. Human stature actually increased by 8 inches average human size okay

<timemark seconds="2253" />

by 11:50 this accumulated wealth that ensued from the benign climate of the medieval warm. Is what allowed the the great cathedral building here to ensue which began between 11:30 and 11:50 ad and what we see is he still magnificent Cathedrals have you been to Europe and visit in any of the cathedral put that on your to-do list get there and look at some of these extraordinary works of art that were built during the High Gothic or high Middle Ages between like I said about 11:50 and the early 1300 they built about 80 of these magnificent organizing of thousands of Highly highly skilled Craftsmen armies of workers and Craftsmen you had

<timemark seconds="2313" />

stone masons and carpenters in glaciers and astronomers and geometry and European Society could become relatively wealthy and this wealth was brought on by This Global warmth right now we see the End of This Magnificent Gothic building boom In The End by the way there's about five hundred smaller Abby's that were constructed during this interval this is a very prolific time for a number of reasons this was a time that dumped your the Templar knights forming you probably heard of the Templar knights I'm sure you had schools of Kabbalah being founded in Spain and in you had the rise of Catherine ISM you had the Troubadours you had these amazing spiritual things going on Amazing culturally it was a very extraordinary

<timemark seconds="2373" />

return those High Middle Ages well a lot of those Gothic Cathedrals were never finished and what we see is that some of them have the appearance or not I'm a builder by profession and you know it's it's I've looked at some of these in a very much like is there going along building and then all of a sudden one day nobody shows up to work and they're still tools laying around or still materials that often the pilot were waiting to be incorporated into the structure and what happened was that the climate begin to cool again between 1315 and 1320 precisely when we see the end of this tremendous Gothic building boom is when the climate begin to cool and it cool for the next several decades and what we didn't see a repeat of what happened between 5:36 and 5:42 ad

<timemark seconds="2426" />

agricultural collapses crops rotting in the fields people going hungry between I think what's wrong between 1340 and 1345 the onset of the Black Flag and once again the population of Europe was decimated and it took a hundred and fifty years basically to recover from that and what we see is that what what what was happening is the plant when shifting into What's called the little ice age will you probably heard that term too little ice age right there was two faces to the little ice age and the first face began like Center on 1320 lasted about a hundred and fifty years and then there was a break and it was during that break that warm. It basically the Renaissance kicked in and we be in to really move forward the second phase of the little Ice Age came in during the 1600s and it was actually even colder than the first phase and worldwide glaciers expanded to the largest they had been in

<timemark seconds="2486" />

10000 to 12000 years since the end of the glaciers had been smaller now during the big eye little ice age they grew and they grew to the biggest did they ban in 10,000 years it's important to have that context of understanding when we talked about Glacier recession because the glaciers begin to recede around the middle of the 19th century as the little Ice Age begin to wane and Global warm warm to begin to Return to the Planet this happened in the mid-1800s around 1840-1860 we see the little Ice Age coming to an end and at that point the glaciers worldwide begin to receive contract they've been pretty much contracted uniformly since they're so we were talking about Glacier recession it's important to understand that the glacier recession really began a century-and-a-half ago or more and his basically can

<timemark seconds="2546" />

continue more less uniformly since then with no real change with the Advent of of human fossil fuel to the atmosphere human carbon dioxide which began really in Earnest during the second world war is when when we begin to add significant amounts of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere it's important to realize that the glaciers had been receiving almost a full Century before that point so when you see all this modern hysteria about global warming in the human created global warming that week we keep hearing about in the news and that our influence on the atmosphere did this drive you crazy and do you think it's silly when it obviously human beings are contribute to the carbon footprint right and obviously that has an effect on global warming yes now

<timemark seconds="2605" />

in a very complex equation right there many factors influencing climate of which carbon dioxide is only one my problem with so much of the stuff that's coming out in mainstream media which is coming through the intergovernmental panel on climate change is simply that when when they were instituted back in the early 90s by the United Nations the United Nations framework convention on climate change basically gave them a mandate which is demonstrate that humans are causing climate change right so they focused exclusively on carbon dioxide but there's all kinds of other things going on for example

<timemark seconds="2646" />

cosmic rays are constantly bombarding the Earth right Cosmic Ray's produce clouds the more of the cosmic rays penetrate the atmosphere the more low altitude cloud cover there is Altitude clouds reflect heat back into space now the amount of cosmic rays penetrate the atmosphere is the function of a couple of things you've got the heliosphere which is though that the whole essentially the energy envelope of the sun which encompasses the whole solar system the sun actually is fairly variable and what that means is that when the solar wind is in in more intense phase like when when the sun spots for example are very active the solar wind is is much stronger what that does is it serves as a buffer that prevents cosmic rays from penetrating the atmosphere of the Earth

<timemark seconds="2706" />

strongly also acts as a buffer so here's two things that are completely not included in the scenarios of the ipcc but probably have a very profound effect on global climate is you know probably know that the field his periodically throughout Earth history disappeared completely sometimes it's it's disappeared and come back with reverse polarity will I do magnetic field acts as a buffer which helps to reduce the amount of cosmic rays penetrating the atmosphere is How to Disappear Completely

<timemark seconds="2750" />

I don't know and I don't know if really anybody knows I haven't kept up with all of the most recent research on geomagnetism but you know when you got a new hold a little compass in your hand and it points to North right okay that's the geomagnetic field that's being measured by the compass it's moving its fluctuating and for whatever reason throughout the history of the earth it has completely disappeared at some point and his reverse polarity it's it was the the reversing of the polarity of the geomagnetic field that helped prove prove the reality of continental drift because as date that the Mid-Atlantic Ridge separates in and lava flows out it crystallizes and locked into the crystalline structure of the of the lava is the the direction of the magnetic field and the polarity of the magnetic field is imprinted in there if you look at the research going back to the 1950s they realize that you had

<timemark seconds="2810" />

Stripes effect effectively as you moved away from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge as the as the lava flowed out and crystallized locked in the Jew make Daddy feel they looked at it and I could see that there were times when it hit completely reversed itself and so this was very powerful evidence that

<timemark seconds="2834" />

Atlantic Ocean had been spreading and in getting back to this whole Atlantis thing which is interesting to me is because when you look at it at Plato's account he describes Atlantis is being west of the pillars of herakles which of course is the Straits of Gibraltar the mouth of the Mediterranean

<timemark seconds="2852" />

he describes how if you go you come to some islands then you come to some more islands and that was the island complex at Atlantis and beyond that was another whole continent he describes that right you look in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean you've got the Azores Plateau which is now a couple of thousand feet under the sea the Azore Islands are the tops of mountains that emerge from the surface of the ocean right and they sit right on the Atlantic the Mid-Atlantic Ridge now the Mid-Atlantic Ridge

<timemark seconds="2892" />

some of the thinnest crust on the planet right and it's it's like a giant shooter or a giant crack that runs up halfway around the planet well when you have an ice age you start piling ice up on till like the North American continent what happens is the weight of that ice begins to crush the the the crust of the earth down into the mantle is called isostasy which is a vertical movement you know continental drift is horizontal isostasy is vertical now it's just like right now you're sitting on that soft chair right and your ass is creating a depression in the cushion of the chair right that's isostatic depression you didn't realize that did you know that your ass is creating isostatic depression right and when you get up and you walk away then you will have isostatic compensation you'll have isostatic rebound because the cushion will now rise because the wait has been removed it's the same thing

<timemark seconds="2953" />

with the ice Mass on the continent the Iceman hundreds of billions of trillions of tons of iced the center of the North American continent or or the center of a lease Canada down as much as several thousand feet into the mantle with the removal of that ice the land begins to rebound Hudson Bay is the depression left over from the thickest part of the ice right now so we could probably even pull some up here in a minute there photographs taken where you can see the elevator Shoreline surrounding Hudson Bay because it's still Rising right what's interesting to is if you look at the the the distance between the shorelines you'll see that

<timemark seconds="3001" />

there's a greater distance because the land was Rising faster as the Millennia have gone on the distance separating each Shoreline has diminished but now you have to think that all of that weight is being transferred back into the ocean basins a lot of it was dumped directly into the Atlantic Ocean either via like the Saint Lawrence River up there the Hudson River up in the New York area or via the Mississippi River into the Gulf of Mexico now you got all this water dumping back into the ocean like I said ocean levels are coming up hundreds of feet right now you're adding all of this weight to the ocean bass and now you got the Mid-Atlantic Ridge which is some of the thinnest crust on the Earth right

<timemark seconds="3046" />

this is what it's doing

<timemark seconds="3048" />

if I could hinge line right so now you picture during a glacial age when the weight is taken out it does this lifts up lifts up listening now I'm watching when the ice melts the water goes in sea level rises it subsides right now you look at the Azores Plateau is a chunk of the African plate that got left over when the continents separated around 70 to 80 million years ago right if we you've seen the maps and show me how you can fit the continents together if you fit these back together if you if you reverse continental drift go back about 70 or 80 million years and it's all fits together like a piece of the puzzle but when it's separated piece of the African plate got left behind and this is what is the Azores plateau and it's it's right there a stride the Mid-Atlantic Ridge it's maybe a little bit smaller than the other than ice

<timemark seconds="3108" />

which is considered to be an island but a pretty good-sized Island right now if you're doing this and you have as much as two or three thousand feet or maybe more of this vertical movement rights can you add to that the 400 feet above sea level rise now you can I think begin to get a scientific rationale for how you may have had a large island in the Mid-Atlantic back during the Ice Age also additional evidence has suggested that the Gulf Stream which now basically brings subtropical warmed up to Northwestern Europe me if you were to terminate the Gulf Stream and England would would have some pretty pretty malignant times so in Northwestern Europe because the warmth is being brought up by that Gulfstream right

<timemark seconds="3159" />

stream about 45 to 46 degrees which was hundreds of miles farther south Shores Plateau a big chunk of that Azores Plateau would have been above sea level during the Ice Age and that Gulfstream with its warrant was just basically embraced it see so if you suddenly Joe found yourself transported mysteriously back to the ice age that's probably where you might want to go is the Azores play till I might have been one of the most benign places on Earth to live during the Ice Age and if there was a place where civilization could involve that would be a very logical place for it to occur there's nothing really pseudo-scientific now about assuming that there could have been some type of historic reality behind the stories of Atlantis of course the problem is a factor that has gotten so grafted onto

<timemark seconds="3219" />

we don't have any hard evidence large islands in the Mid-Atlantic during the Ice Age so

<timemark seconds="3238" />

that's intense that's so incredible it's so it's it's it's so crazy to think how how much things have changed while human beings have been here the idea that during Gobekli Tepe which is 12000 years ago that North America was covered with ice

<timemark seconds="3256" />

and they this is when these people in Turkey had created this incredible structure so when you see this that the modernist Dairy about global warming which is really essentially been like a wrestling match between the left and the right this is weird thing where the right wants to support like burning coal and the economy by putting all these environmental regulations on natural resources and then the last Witch is screaming at the top of their lungs that the sky is falling the oceans are going to rise and people going to drown when you know so much about what has happened over the course of the earth when you've studied this for a great deal of time like you have what is your take on all this stuff well I guess my take is is is fairly simple I I tend to think that you know if you know if you look at the the the whole process of if you look at the carbon cycle

<timemark seconds="3316" />

what you see there is interest in Winterplace can talk to thank you you know the context we have to say right now we're approaching 400 parts per million of the ambient amount of CO2 in the atmosphere

<timemark seconds="3338" />

beginning of the Industrial Revolution it was about a hundred parts per million last you could say basically that over the last century we have increased the amount of CO2 measurable CO2 into the atmosphere assuming that it's all from us. I mean there's questions about that too because if there are other factors inducing global warming such as changes in in solar irradiance the amount of insolation penetrating atmosphere and so on it means that the oceans are warming as a result of that okay oceans are a gigantic carbon dioxide sink when they are they exude carbon dioxide when they're cold they absorb right so if you have a natural warming it's going to expel some carbon dioxide so it's not even clear necessarily parts per million is totally the result of fossil fuel burning but for the sake of argument let's say that it is okay a hundred parts per million that's

<timemark seconds="3397" />

minuscule trace of this very important constituents of our atmosphere you know that carbon dioxide is what fuels photosynthesis right and if you start reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere once you start dropping below 200 parts per million and you get down to about 150-200 photosynthesis plant photosynthesis starts shutting down the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere of the scale you know if we look at history going back when you mentioned it the cretaceous-tertiary when the dinosaurs ruled

<timemark seconds="3433" />

many times more of the Mount of CO2 up to well in excess of 1000 parts per million several thousand parts per million in the atmosphere if we have increased the amount of CO2 by 100 parts per million in a hundred years it means we've for every million molecules of air up there we add one molecule of CO2 every year or two maybe try to make it a little bit more comprehensible

<timemark seconds="3465" />

for every hundred thousand molecules of air up there every 10 years we had one molecule of CO2

<timemark seconds="3475" />

I'm not convinced that that's going to lead to Global catastrophe a huge tank with a hundred thousand fish in it every 10 years you're throwing one more fish are you even going to notice

<timemark seconds="3489" />

you know I think what's happened is that CO2 like I said is one variable in a very complex equation but all of the other variables as far as the the government-funded research goes have been excluded from the debate and what dismays me is that we're told it all scientists agree on this no all scientists don't agree when you have the major government-funded program like climate change research which is funded to the tune of about 2 billion dollars per year

<timemark seconds="3525" />

you're going to have a large vested interest in basically I mean if these guys came out and said nasty or two is really not a big deal it's perhaps feeling plant growth in this is an interesting aside you know if you look at the the projections of forest in inventory back in the 50s and 60s based upon deforestation is result of Timber as a result of Agriculture the projections that at how quickly Forest inventories were going to rebound if you look at those projections back in the 50s and 60s and then you realize it in the ensuing. Of time we've now got exhaustive highly accurate satellite surveys that can actually count the number of hectares a forest

<timemark seconds="3575" />

what's interesting is in the 90s when they really started looking at this date of just how much for us there was compared to what the projections work there was like 25 to 40% more for worldwide

<timemark seconds="3592" />

what fueled does prolific Forest growth well it's very likely did at least part of it was because of the slight increase in CO2 is Realtors aroused as a result of our fossil fuel-burning now we we put in every year we burn about introduced into the atmosphere about 6 billion tons of CO2 what was about 750 or 760 billion tons of CO2 in the atmosphere naturally and at least a third of that his cycling through from from atmosphere into the biosphere into the oceans and so on so our contribution isn't really that significant but another part of the argument is that

<timemark seconds="3638" />

this is been admitted right in the ipcc report is that based on the amount of fossil fuel that we're burning there should be twice as much CO2 into the atmosphere in the atmosphere is were now measuring so what they have been talking about for about 15 years now is where is the missing carbon what what's this missing carbon sink will probably some of its going into the ocean but most likely a lot of it is going into fueling plant growth and Forest growth worldwide and there's a lot of studies that are beginning to come out now that shows that perhaps some of the the desert areas of the planet rather than expanding are actually Contracting so you know at this point there's a lot of things we still have to learn when it comes down to understanding the climate where in the infancy you can't talk to a single climatologist and it come up with a one single coherent answer or agreement on what his actually provoked the play

<timemark seconds="3698" />

to go into a full ice age or what has caused it to come out if an ice age if you don't have to if you don't know that we still have a hell of a lot to learn about how the climate works so I get really frustrated when I hear this claim that the debate is over to debate is over because the debate hasn't really even begun yet you say we need to really look at all of these other two factors as well I mean when you look at the wind currents and ocean currents you have the El Nino Southern oscillation you have the the the Indian Ocean dipole you have the Pacific decadal oscillation have a very profound influence on the climate but they're essentially being ignored within the within the government funded science to a large extent and you have a lot of scientists who have objected to some of the claims of certainty made by the ipcc scientists and for the most part the left likes to demonize them this is people like

<timemark seconds="3758" />

I think probably this deleting of climate deniers is Fred singer because he wants was given an $10,000 unsolicited donation from Exxon years and years ago but you got guys like Roy Spencer and Craig and Sherwood did Sol and Robert Bolling and Timothy ball and and and the list goes on and on these are distinguish climate scientist that have devoted their lives to understanding

<timemark seconds="3786" />

climate science who say well there's a lot of flaws in the methodology of the ipcc but by saying enter the cell to the left in your right see what happened it's turned into a political football it's an eidolon ideological debate it's an ideological debate a political debate and it's just too bad that the science of the things his head the suffering the consequences it is it is fascinating because even hearing you say this I'm thinking like it starts a popping triggers like I'm not the type of person that worries too much about being labeled because I've been labeled a million times already is an idiot it doesn't it doesn't bother me to start

<timemark seconds="3832" />

contemplating the possibilities of controversial ideas but when I'm listening to you sing this all I'm hearing is the knee-jerk reaction of climate denier climate always a climate denier this guy's a climate denier and seeing these fucking things that we've grown to be accustomed to on television when you have a guy on the left who has one point of view and a guy on the right who says something wacky and then everybody fights about it and you know then that YouTube clips you look at the comments and it's filled with this guy's a faget and that guy's a hope your house goes underwater you fucking climate tonight if it's just what I'm listening to you and you mean this podcast has been over an hour already and it's incredibly complex we have barely scratched the surface and you're never going to hear anything like this on any television show because most people feel that the general public does not have the attention span to absorb all of the

<timemark seconds="3892" />

information is really complex explanation of the known science of the changing of the atmosphere of the earth so when people start talking about climate denying and what what is going on with climate change what they're really doing is establishing their position on what side I'm the side of a rational person who believes in science and education but how much of this if you actually explored how much of it as anybody actually looked at that supports industry and I'm a person who believes that the United States needs to recover from our economic disaster and you know we got a Frac a few Wells you know so be it very distinct and often times shallow ideological perspective and when I say shallow I mean shallow from the point of the general public person like me was not a scientist observing it and just picking a side

<timemark seconds="3952" />

very little information really and you talked to I would like to grab grab the average person the average Lefty and the average righty the things that they're you know they have an opinion on global change and just just do me a favor and just write down what you know just right down I want you looking online

<timemark seconds="3976" />

it's true it's true Joe fascinating it's so fascinating to me because it becomes another one of those things ideology is that mean I don't remember who said it but it's it's the enemy of free-thinking you you get in these ideological clusters and then anything outside of this thing these predetermined patterns of behavior that you do I subscribe to anything becomes forbidden it becomes can't even entertain that you can't even approach the idea you see it with everything you see with atheism you see it with any isms with feminism with the men's rights people who subscribe to the variables that don't fit into their equation that they've already subscribe to they don't want to be labeled as that other side and anytime they don't want to be labeled they start ignoring any Ave

<timemark seconds="4036" />

is there any ideas that don't fit within this rigid description locked into these idiot logical paradigms and then from that point on basically their perspective is modified more by emotion and rationalities more by you know their feelings rather than real information and it's too bad I mean I know what to blame it on maybe the fact that the government runs all the schools I don't know you know the other not teaching people critical thinking skills they're not teaching people how to actually become how to be scientifically literate which is really sad but you know it's it's like you know you you we keep hearing the term climate change denier right well

<timemark seconds="4091" />

there's no such thing I don't think you're going to find a single climate scientist of any persuasion that did not realize that the climate is changing and you got to realize that the the terminology has shifted it was global warming originally went when James Hanson gave his testimony before Congress in the summer of 1988 you know when proposed these potential tipping points and catastrophic outcomes of our burning of fossil fuel we've gone from there to the United Nations the ipcc in channeling all of this funding to it and I think the consequence is that you know when you say again scuse me we went from global warming to climate change

<timemark seconds="4142" />

why do they not really use global warming is a visitor many more as mainly because for 15 years the average global temperature is flatlined and this is based upon you know the most act like satellite surveys the ipcc generally focuses only on ground-based sensors which are subjected to a some considerable by it's because you know your picture of ground-based sensor is most of our sitting at airports when these things were being put in post World War II the bulk of them 40s and 50s into the 60s many of these airports were you know Jason to small towns they were surrounded by fields and farms for us what's happened is the urban area has encroached you know every when you when you create Street pavement buildings all of this absorbs heat right hand and no one has really done an exhaustive study of the potential bias it's introduced into the

<timemark seconds="4202" />

sensors part at least part of the warming of these ground-based sensors may have nothing to do with carbon dioxide at all it may just have to do you know yourself if you walked out you know if you're walking in a field and then you walk onto off asphalt parking lot immediately it's it's much much hotter Anthony watch was another one of the dissenters that was demonized is the only one who has really attempted to exhaustively document the accuracy of the ground-based sensors

<timemark seconds="4240" />

please come up with this perhaps as much as it's 30 to 50% of the perceived warming of the last century which is about eight tenths of a degrees centigrade is probably as a result of that have been introduced program underway all the major metropolitan cities are now trying to mitigate the effects of this heat because of all of the Samantha in the buildings and the parking lots are always hotter than the surrounding rural areas so the question is been legitimately raised how much of a into the ground base answers what when we turn to their the balloon sensors were the radiosonde balloon sensors in the satellite sensors basically what they're showing is that the average global temperature

<timemark seconds="4300" />

flat for 15 years well because of that and in many of the scientists like Phil Jones of the ipcc is basically publicly admitted when you look at the average temperature from that perspective it hasn't warmed in 50 now they're Regional pockets of of warming and Records being sad all the time because local conditions will affect change enormously just like I was talking about the urban heat island effect is is a local or Regional condition but because of the fact that the climate hasn't warmed statistically significantly in 15 years now we don't talk about global warming we talked about climate change but those two terms are not interchangeable global warming it's a very specific model of climate change which is that you got this 15 Micron wavelength of of CO2 in the atmosphere that strap

<timemark seconds="4360" />

infrared radiation emanating from the earth right okay but if you're talking about climate change now suddenly you know our umbrella goes much much huge and it now encompasses all of these other things that I was talking about and to question the consensus ideas to consent to question that CO2 is the primary or sole driver climate is not to be a climate change denier because I would challenge anybody he even uses that Turbo show me an example of a climate scientist no matter where they fault in the argument that is denying that the climate is changing

<timemark seconds="4402" />

been anybody who study the climate all knows they did she's changed dramatically and dynamically on any scale you can look at whether it's the decade-old scaled at Centennial or Millennial or Beyond it changes on every level and that's the thing we have to recognize that if we stop burning fossil fuels tomorrow we can drive another car when we shut down all the coal plants I'm going to tell you this the climate would not stop changing

<timemark seconds="4432" />

when you see a story like yours one it's in the news about u.s. Senator Marco Rubio's denial of man-made climate change should play well with his tea party base who support he'll need if he indeed runs for president in 2016 but in taking this position Florida's jr. Republican senator ignores the vast majority of the world's climate scientists who say human activity is contributing to climate change and rising sea levels human activity is contributing activity contributes to climate change human activity again is one variable in a very complex equation I wish Marco Marco Rubio would keep his mouth shut until he goes and spends about six months or a year really doing the homework because any could talk a little bit more intelligently about it that is the problem right it really does take that long it does but yeah I know

<timemark seconds="4492" />

you are but seven years ago something like that had already spent decades observing the effects of climate change an asteroid impacts in the history of these things mean the amount of time just absorbing the information so you can rattle off like this in a podcast me what the fuck are you into this like how did you get down this Rabbit Hole listen on rabbit hole right there but that you're willing to exchange this information with us or IR imparted on us because it it's it's a very different perspective cuz I know you're not a right-wing lunatic you're very sciencebase guy but you're you're looking at this in the way you're explaining it is incredibly rational and Incredibly frustrating to me that there's not that many people that are that are that are saying this

<timemark seconds="4552" />

what the upside I think of the whole global warming issue or the climate change issue is this that if you know the thing is is I made the point that even if we stopped all fossil fuel consumption tomorrow the climate is still going to change and it's going to change dramatically it's going to change sometimes even catastrophically what we need to do from here on out is basically think about strategies of adaptability if as a result of this whole issue even even though I think it's Miss based Miss plaid If part of it comes out of this is that we begin to develop strategies of adaptability that would be a good thing if however we focus so exclusively on carbon dioxide to the exclusion of everything else

<timemark seconds="4602" />

that should be a bad thing

<timemark seconds="4604" />

because the climate is going to change no matter what we do or where we go with it the climate is going to change to put up solar power panels until the cows come home that the house is there on the beach in Malibu are still going to be underwater in hundred years not necessarily in the in the little ice age of about a hundred and fifty years that basically led to the Renaissance right when we been in it in a recession of the little Ice Age A Interruption of the little ice age for about a hundred and fifty years and right now you know it again VIP seat one of the things that frustrates me is that they basically exclude solar physicists and solar scientists who are essentially saying that insulation levels insolation the amount of solar energy penetrating the atmosphere is it one of the lowest levels in in thousands of years and

<timemark seconds="4664" />

I mean you're our solar physicist that are saying you know what we could be at the beginning of another phase of the little ice age now if our CO2 is helping to ameliorate somewhat returned a little ice age that would be a good thing so muscle cars are green that's what I'm getting out of this cold and muscle cars are good for the forest well the problem with Cole is not too much to CO2 is is to me is just the particulate matter you know that's a different question altogether pollution the pollution which is harder riffic in China coal plants as you see these people that are essentially walking it looks like they're in the middle of a forest fire there walking down the street it's just dark everywhere that's a different issue I consider myself a conservationist in the respect that we we basically need examples of pristine nature because ultimately nature is

<timemark seconds="4724" />

the most powerful teacher and we need examples we need places where nature is just left alone to do its thing without interference of human beings we need clean air nobody has the right to dump shit in the air that other people have to breathe nobody has the right to dump shit in the water that other people have to drink to me those are different questions and really where are the more of our focus should be rather than these abstractions I have found course I've got some flak over the last few years by saying some of the things I've been saying here you know that I've had people stand up and accuse me of you say we can just do anything we want we can just destroy the Earth which of course is not the case and not saying that at all at all when we being to look at the bigger context of this thing and we begin to understand that the extraordinary changes that this planet has been through and even to some of the Lesser things in recent years of Mount Saint Helens remember when that erupted in 1980

<timemark seconds="4784" />

tens of thousands of Acres were turned into a lunar landscape right well if you read the accounts of the scientist biologist and zoologist the ecologist would have been studying what happened to that decimated landscape in the aftermath what you find out is there a surprise and almost shocked at how quickly nature recovered from Matt and how quickly you know colonizer plants moved in and was followed by a whole the whole succession ecological succession of reclaiming that Lance if you look at the the Exxon Valdez disaster

<timemark seconds="4826" />

up in Alaska are they in Alaskan in that was over the short-term devastating to the local ecology and yet what's interesting again there's been several books written by some of the lead scientist involved in that talk about how remarkably quick nature begin to to reclaim and and recover from that and there's some irony where the government forced to Exxon to go in and do its clean up is actually suffered more than the areas that we just left alone for nature to reclaim that's fascinating so the chemicals they use in order to break up with the gulf that's me alright with that those this person said they were spraying all over the area but probably should have just left the golf alone because you know when you have a submarine earthquakes they can expel huge amounts of hydrocarbons into the ocean Nature has been dealing with it

<timemark seconds="4886" />

massive explosions of hydrocarbon into the oceans and into the Marine ecology for millions and millions of years was bad but I think you know what we'll see is the recovery time is been considered faster than most people believed possible what's really going to turn up looking at all this is that nature is robust and when we begin to look at the number of times that nature has been disrupted by what we've been talking about asteroids and comets and Princeton

<timemark seconds="4920" />

here's here's a perspective for you you know what the peak of the Cold War when us and the Soviet Union were eyeball-to-eyeball with our nuclear weapons on on high alert and we had we had 10,000 weapons on our side they had 10,000 weapons on their side

<timemark seconds="4942" />

the total nuclear Arsenal at the Times had about 18,000 megatons of of energy capable of being delivered 18000 megatons now that means 18 million tons of TNT the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima was about ten thousand tons of TNT show hundred times a hundred Hiroshima bombs would be one Megaton right now there was about say fifteen to eighteen thousand megatons total in the Arsenal of the superpowers and Ice the Cold War had we unleashed an all-out nuclear war and fired every Warhead that we had in our arsenals at each other

<timemark seconds="4988" />

15000 Warheads Warheads 15000 megatons it would have been an environmental disaster unprecedented in history you remember the scenarios about nuclear winter right because of all of the fires and the sudden the particulate matter thrown into the atmosphere it could literally bring on a a mini ice age right probably caused without even the radiation cause major collapse of the human population right get this number and fifteen thousand megatons okay now even a small asteroid impact or let's say let's say the the asteroid impact that it struck the Yucatan there's a simple formula that you can use when you look at the crater size

<timemark seconds="5036" />

you take the size of the crater and raise it expressed in kilometers raise it to the power of 3.4 and multiply the result by 2.4 and what it's going to give you the energy yielding megatons of that object strike if I put in 280 kilometers into this calculator here which is a diameter of the Yucatan crater and I raise it to the 3.4 power and then I multiply that by the 2.4 power I get the the Megaton yield all right that number comes up to be 111 million megatons

<timemark seconds="5080" />

I divide that by 15,000

<timemark seconds="5083" />

and basically what we have there is about equivalent to the entire nuclear arsenal of the superpowers eight thousand times over

<timemark seconds="5096" />

8000 * / know what kind of environmental consequence would there be to that well we saw that Global firestorms you know that this the studies of the amount of boundary layer shows that the amount of biomass that went up in firestorms at the KT boundary was about equivalent to every plant on Earth today going up in fight right you had tsunamis that were perhaps a thousand feet in height you had Global earthquakes probably measure 10 to 11 on the Richter scale and you know the Richter scale works its logarithmic so that an 8.0 earthquake is 10 times more powerful than a 7.0 9.0 is 10 times more powerful than 8.0 and 11.0 earthquake is going to be unimaginable the whole framework of the globe would have shaken you probably would have massive failures on every fault line on the planet now the KT event

<timemark seconds="5156" />

in the middle of the five Great Extinction events right there was ordovician-silurian there was the permian-triassic there was a couple more

<timemark seconds="5165" />

two of them were more extreme than that now even even much smaller than that right when they talk about a Tipping Point you know are we talkin about a Tipping Point that could trigger a climate change a disastrous catastrophic climate change is being a few parts per million more of CO2 or is a Tipping Point really a mile wide asteroid slamming into the Earth in a hundred times the speed of a rifle bolt that could be a Tipping Point my friend and that is happened thousands of times and hundreds of times since we humans have been here hundreds of hundreds of times when was the most recent one that was the Holocene crater probably collapse of the late Bronze Age civilizations around four thousand two hundred years ago may have been precipitated by a series of impact there's evidence emerging that the climate downturned it occurred between 5:36 and 5:40 ad that I talked about earlier

<timemark seconds="5225" />

may have been triggered by a series of multiple impacts one that looks like it occurred off the coast of Norway and another one that looks like it occurred off the coast of New Zealand like tandem impacts right around 5:36 ad and and we're basically faced with the idea now that literally impacts from things from space may be hundreds of times more likely than anybody was even imagining you know a generation ago so we're essentially this civilization that is banking on the knowledge that we've accumulated over a very small amount of time and as we're uncovering more more evidence more more information we're starting to realize our ignorance we're starting to realize how little we know about our own history the history of this particular species and how its interacted in this crazy volatile environment of Earth and how many times have been hit by rocks shop

<timemark seconds="5285" />

100 years ago the Assumption was one of these impacts is 10 years old so since then some new ones have it since then has been discovery of this new clear glass that they found all over Europe and all over Asia I think are you referring to the possibility that the thing that Graham was talking about the 13th 2000 year ago event I think I I think that's what it is what I'm referring to is it was a mainstream report about all these these pieces of this very similar material to what they find it nuclearblast yes it was all over the place at when they did the core samples around 12,000 years ago is getting stronger and stronger each year that they're there may have been a multiple impact

<timemark seconds="5345" />

the terminated the Ice Age and this still very controversial idea because the gradualists just don't want to go there and this is probably what killed off mass extinction of verbally Mammoth mass extinction of a saber-tooth tiger and a series of animals that they really have not figured out why I like there's there's been all sorts of theories about why the wooly mammoth went extinct in some of them are ridiculous like that people did it you know and what a fucking looks like like a Jesus Christ how many of the North and the other thing is ridiculous about Emma obviously when I say ridiculous I'm ridiculous that I shouldn't even be making that statement I don't have done very little research but the research that I've read and the people that have question that I've talked about the mass Graves where they found these animals that have died instantaneously thousands of them and now

<timemark seconds="5405" />

consumed either they don't show signs of predation or a butchering there they've there they've died in full form full body yes and a massive massive yards in NC you know for centuries Christine Mammoth tusks Ivory have been hauled out of the permafrost of Siberia in trainload Lots you know in this is gone into the global Ivory Market literally for three or four hundred years some estimates are that there may have been as many as four to 10 million wooly mammoths worldwide most people don't realize the right here in North America there were three species of proboscidean or three species of elephants during the Ice Age 1 species Indian India has another species

<timemark seconds="5451" />

we are three species here during the time we go back Lee tappy was being built during the elephants this is the beresaad Commandments it was found in 1901 quick Frozen with flash at the time this Photograph was taken in the flash off of the skull that's why it's it's it's bear but what you see there immediately dirty wolves eating some million-year-old meet household product 13000 year old be left just in front of his face back and forth between this image in the next when you'll be able to see

<timemark seconds="5509" />

this was how the wooly mammoth was found and so they took photos of it when they left it alone in the walls came and got it I believe it and at the time that the wooly mammoth met his demise he was eating flowering plants right now it's important to keep that in mind his stomach was full of about two dozen different varieties of plants and sedges and things that have been munching on up in Siberia at the time that he did he met his death

<timemark seconds="5556" />

number of interesting things the contents of his stomach could not putrefied right now that's mysterious at the fact that his his flesh was still edible at least by Wolves you know that the stories about you know the scientist eating mammoth Burgers is probably made up but the Wolves definitely were able to eat the flesh right it was described as still being marbled almost as if it had just been frozen

<timemark seconds="5582" />

you know a week ago but since the time that the woolly mammoth died it had its whole carcass that's was a 6-ton woolly mammoth so it had been frozen for how many thousands and thousands of years and so thoroughly Frozen that the contents of the stomach and not putrefied a woolly mammoth of internal heat right

<timemark seconds="5608" />

Clarence Birdseye the founder bird's-eye foods and the inventor of the fast freezing of foods for preservation involved in examining and in speculating about this woolly mammoth his conclusion basically that does something like this

<timemark seconds="5627" />

in order to prevent the contents of the stomach from putrefying the entire carcass of the Wooly Mammoth would have had to been frozen through and through in 10 hours or less

<timemark seconds="5638" />

a bear in mind that this wooly mammoth was eating flowering plants right now how cold would it have to be to freeze a 6-ton woolly mammoth in 10 hours or less his estimate was probably somewhere around a hundred and fifty degrees below zero

<timemark seconds="5654" />

from flowering plants to 150 degrees below zero in 10 hours in 10 hours what would causes something like that well there's been some speculation the speculation that I found most interesting was possibly volcanic gases that had been ejected into the stratosphere approached absolute zero in because of the cold fell back to her I think you could get the same effect perhaps with gas is released from a disintegrating, nucleus

<timemark seconds="5693" />

it's still a mystery I mean anything that anybody says at this point is purely speculative it's clear that whatever this Mammoth underwent was disastrous in the extreme you saw him sitting there on his haunches right both of his hip bones were broken which means that he was slammed back onto his haunches very violently he was also found with an erect penis which means that he die by suffocation

<timemark seconds="5720" />

which means that he was entombed virtually instantly buy the material that later became the permafrost we're talking about the little ice age you earlier and I was talking about how the little Ice Age ended around 1850 this guy was found about 19 after the climate in Siberia have been warming someone the bear softer Riverhead shifted its channeled and eroded some of the Cliff face back and then one year one warm spring there was a collapse of the Cliff face that exposed the mammoth's to the atmosphere and at that point is when the walls came in and begin to Devour the flash on the on the skull see so clearly this morally Mammoth is an example of or indicative of some type of a catastrophe weather was a global catastrophe or local catastrophe nobody knows but

<timemark seconds="5777" />

clearly was catastrophic but that will only man but there's only one of dozens of examples of flash frozen late pleistocene mammals that died under similar circumstances and these large graveyards of of mass extinctions of the thousands and thousands of animals what are the best examples of them cuz I know that I've I've seen some of them online but I can't pull them up like I'm sure you can I've got some right here if I can get my laptop to

<timemark seconds="5806" />

Jamie pull up look towards the bottom of the list list you'll see pleistocene the Lost World of the pleistocene

<timemark seconds="5815" />

you see that

<timemark seconds="5818" />

no it's a it's a PowerPoint

<timemark seconds="5821" />

it's in that list of the PowerPoint should I gave you I have some photographs you're so me out I just want to tell you right now you're freaking me out. I have to confess that one of my objectives and coming here what you did it congratulations you're successful I've been terrified of Yellowstone for 4 years now I've watched some late-night documentary was a huge mistake is what I'm saying I was about to go to bed and I was just flipping through the channels and they were going over this thing about a Caldera volcano Yellowstone Caldera and then they started talking about I would say it was it something like six hundred kilometers wide which is something like three hundred miles and they were saying that they didn't even Discover it until they started doing satellite imagery of of Earth and then they realized that oh this was a giant volcano that was so violent and it's a

<timemark seconds="5881" />

option that it blew the mountain off of it and it became this massive crater and that it happens every six 800,000 years ago that the last time it happened was 600000 years ago so hopefully keeping our fingers crossed we got another hundred thousand year if we're lucky yeah but that's another aspect of this component of the dynamic history of planet Earth these these gigantic volcanic eruptions there's been some interesting work linking asteroid impacts with giant volcanic eruptions as well then they would make sense

<timemark seconds="5916" />

that that the energy injected into the Earth by a Major Impact could trigger volcanic eruptions we know that during the Great meltdown event of 11 to 13,000 years ago that there were enormous massive volcanic eruptions in Mount Saint Helens for example was was massively erupting at that time I have photographed I have felt some photographs right here I don't know how much time we have to look at some of this but where I have gone out at found thick layers of white volcanic ash from Mount Saint Helens sandwiched in between these and and it is undoubtedly had to be a response to the fact that you and mass transfer of weight that we were talking about earlier from the continents back to the ocean and when we go through that maybe it's time to go through a few of these images that I brought you can begin to see

<timemark seconds="5976" />

some of the consequences of this melting

<timemark seconds="5980" />

you begin to appreciate that yeah there were these just enormous Mass transfers of weight unloading and certain areas loading and other areas this would clearly have a profound effect on the Subterranean stability and could easily lead to major eruptions and there was a spasm of major volcanic eruptions globally at the time of the transition out of the Ice Age which would only if I had it to the Havelock of that transition and why you know half of the great species of megafauna disappeared a megaphone is basically defined is it any any animal in this case mostly mammals / 44 kg in body weight which is about a hundred pounds include us and if you started thinking about all of the animals globally worldwide there are more than a hundred pounds depending on how you divide up the species there might be a hundred to 20 and 130 different species and I'm talking about

<timemark seconds="6040" />

are lions and tigers and bears and elephants and rhinos and hippos and moose and caribou and dr. Right Down the Line right okay let's go back to the Ice Age the extinction the loss of species at the end of the last ice age was about equivalent in Number the loss of species of Mega mammals was about equivalent in number to the number of species of Mega mammals that still exist so another words these events that terminated the Ice Age basically decimated half of the species of of Mega mammals half of the species disappeared so if you were going to try to effect an equivalent mass extinction of species today over a hundred pounds of body weight in order to get the equivalent of that mass extinction episode of 12013 thousand years ago since it's absolutely the truth

<timemark seconds="6100" />

official like or mainstream explanation for this it doesn't exist okay you brought up the idea of its called Overkill which has been to Siri for decades which is the human Hunters exterminated the wooly mammoth and in some vague way the extermination of the woolly mammoth being at the top of the food chain somehow ripple effect down through the ranks of species and somehow perhaps in an unaddressed way resulted in the loss of all these other species in the morning you said that serious ridiculous and that's an understatement I mean you're talking about Neil perhaps bands of few hundred or maybe even a thousand individuals migrant bands human Hunters coming in and somehow able to bear in mind that the estimates of human population during this time globally his last thing you asked him

<timemark seconds="6160" />

the population of wooly mammoth but somehow our ancestors were able to wipe out four million to 10 million wooly mammoths reproduce so there was only like 10 million people back then that's based upon interpretation implies opens the door to their possibility of there being a lot more people and the mass extinction also including a massive amount of human beings as well as some interesting evidence emerging now that they're perhaps what's the population collapse between what it's called the Clovis culture in the Folsom culture the Clovis culture appears in North America to be what is believed to have been the earliest culture and there's a site in New Mexico that was the first discovery of the the association of human artifacts meaning spear points in arrowheads and things like that along with it

<timemark seconds="6220" />

mammals right this is Clovis New Mexico it's very interesting sites I visited there about six or seven years ago in order cuz I was looking for this so-called black matte layer which is now been documented it dozens of Clovis sites around North American the black matte layer is this unique layer that essentially separates the pleistocene from the challah C and it's full of soot it's full of iridium nanodiamonds microsphere olds and all of the signature things that are indicative of some kind of a cosmic event is this an image indicative of that is that what this is that yeah that's kind of a blurry image but right there

<timemark seconds="6264" />

that's it up here to see FaceTime microphone strip in the middle shows the black matte player that's exactly yet and what you see below it are the bones of extinct mammals and what you see a couple of thousand years later is Bones of extinct mammals and no air above that black mat layer do you find the bones of the extinct what is extant the means dead that's still a still exist you know there's a very distinct line that can be attributed to some sort of an event yes some sort of an event something before that they're all alive something after that they're all dead they're all dead and a massive amount of the larger mammals gone wiped off the face of Planet off the face of the planet North America lost about 75% of its species of Megaman holy

<timemark seconds="6324" />

shit three quarters. There we go there's some of them what is that thing below marakkanam it's the giant ground sloth it was the size of an elephant these are the glyptodonts these are all ten thousand years ago. Norris Maximus is the giant mower this guy threw him in here for us because he's just such an awesome preacher the terror bird writes the terror bird look at that fucking bird that's a seven-foot-tall a bigger than a bird that doesn't fly so essentially a murderous ostrich real yeah this was at this was the first to ask creditor on the planet for a while

<timemark seconds="6381" />

these guys existed before the saber-tooth tiger but they succumb to one of these Global events you got to bear in mind if you take a census of all the species that ever existed compared to the species now

<timemark seconds="6396" />

conservative to say that 99.99% of all species have become extinct in the one said and of course most of those had went extinct without any help from humans it all stops growing what is that fucking thing that's a lasma therium sibericum Jesus Christ walk the Rhino wow it's insane how big that is a huge a woolly rhinoceros the size of an elephant and it's a seal adanta which is the classic Willie rhinoceros there been quite a few species of these guys found that were flash frozen and this is twelve thousand years ago this thing existed only rhinoceros yes in North America this Christ that's incredible and what is what's the mainstream explanation for these things going away

<timemark seconds="6454" />

good luck on trying to find one I have looked there is none there is there is nothing they don't there's nothing so is this something that they just haven't formed any theories about or they don't try to or it's been ignored because it's not enough information it's been ignored and here's why

<timemark seconds="6475" />

at the dawn of Earth's geological science in the early 19th century to a man every one of the founding fathers of geology whether it was Tina William Buckland or qvar sure James Rodney Murchison Adam Sedgwick he could go right down the line all these guys from 1820-1860 everyone because these were guys basically he would not been indoctrinated into any particular interpretation of vision watches yell something really catastrophic has happened and then what happened was Charles Lyell play fair and hot and basically established the doctrine of uniformitarianism is it's called a mouthful right and basically uniformitarianism

<timemark seconds="6535" />

process is to explain ancient process and so if we see a river a routing its Bank moving sediment creating a sandbar with that if we see like during the early 19th century we were in the last phase of the little ice age and basically what they did was extrapolated from Modern process is to try to explain all the ancient processes this is the doctrine of uniformitarianism okay it's a very powerful model for understanding ancient change however it became ensconced as Dogma so that by the turn of the century as we come right up to the threshold of the 20th century

<timemark seconds="6584" />

it was now considered unscientific to try to explain anything in the past that we couldn't see happening today right so as we go into the 20th century this gradual is Dogma became ensconced in Academia and every geologist from about 1900 up to about 1980 was thoroughly indoctrinated into this idea of the gradualism that all of the earth change that we see going on in the planet today has occurred one grain of sand one drop of water at a time and it was considered very unscientific to begin to invoke things because initially some of the founding fathers of geology interesting theologians

<timemark seconds="6633" />

five nights a number Mike Adam Sedgwick England and he was seeing things like the Thames River Valley and he was saying that the Tim's flowed in his gigantic channel was completely outsized relative to the river that was flowing in it and he says that must have been from a huge flood what he was a theologian right so he said Noah's flood right well as it turns out there are enormous geomorphic effects of gigantic slots all over the planet right we know that now

<timemark seconds="6676" />

Linda 1800's they assumed that if you saw FX a gigantic it had to been Noah's flood well at the same time that you had some idea sent a biological gradualism came along in the form of of Darwinism to sort of complemented each other in in in mutually supporting each other time he millions and millions of years of gradual geological change millions and millions of years for biological change and mutually reinforcing so now we come to the 20th century and for the first three quarters of the 20th century

<timemark seconds="6720" />

that was the Dogma that was indoctrinated into the minds of every earth scientists write and to vary from that was to be pseudo-scientific and you're trying to revert back to biblical fundamentalism if you start talking about giant floods right what happened was and it was like two people like Immanuel velikovsky books in the mid-1950s we're here gathered together in one place all this anomalous evidence from the earth history uniformitarian Paradigm his books were popular successes but mainstream science just slammed them slammed into this guy's a nutcase right well he did make some serious misstep in trying to explain this anomalous geological evidence for catastrophe and it was those missteps that they were able to focus on to try to discredit him however the amassing of evidence for catastrophes in Earth history

<timemark seconds="6780" />

the test of time and what we see is 1980 was a pivotal year that was a year that three separate teams published evidence showing that the cretaceous-tertiary boundary the dinosaur boundary was profoundly catastrophic and that open the door to begin a reconsideration of Earth history now at the same time with the Advent of the space program we are beginning to realize that near-earth space is not a completely empty place it's actually densely populated by all kinds of things eat prior to the Apollo Moon program it was believed that most of the craters on the moon if not all of the craters on the moon were volcanic right post Apollo the realization was his know they're not volcanic their impacts of things from space see how you look at the surface of the Moon and I think the last image on the Joe

<timemark seconds="6840" />

Rogan images there he is going to be a picture of the Moon and you'll see that it's littered littered atmosphere because it doesn't have plants we can actually see applications happened and the point Joe is this if we weren't able to strip away the biosphere the thick layers of sedimentary rocks the oceans the Earth would look like the moon look like fucking Moon a matter of time in perspective that we we really well thank thankfully there's people like you that are paying attention test but we

<timemark seconds="6879" />

with the amount of time the people have been video taping things and writing books is tiny little window it just hasn't been enough time to really get a real account of how often is takes place because that that amount of time although it's a grand amount of time compared to our lives to the life of an individual for the life of the planet it's nothing it's a perspective exactly exactly and this is one reason why I'm an advocate for moving forward and essentially becoming a cosmic civilization you see I came of age during the Heyday of the Mercury and Gemini Gemini and Apollo programs and you know that was the one thing when I look back and one of the last times I was really proud of my country was when we put those man on the moon when we planted our American flag on the moon and I really believe that can 1969 1970s

<timemark seconds="6939" />

any wish to move the human species into this Grandeur of cosmic environment and of course you know the Vietnam War and other priorities Administration shifted huge amounts of money away from the space program the timetable it was set out that we were going to have a permanent lunar Base by the end of the 70s first manned mission to Mars before the 80s was over independent self-supporting colonies in space 2001 A Space Odyssey came out of you ever seen it Sean

<timemark seconds="6979" />

1968 nobody had any it was no stretch of the imagination to assume that by 2001 yet there were going to be orbiting hotels in space right that could have happened but we lost our vision we lost our will and we just got sidetracked you know I remember in the seventies talking to people about the potential of colonizing space using the materials and resources found in space and that the knee-jerk response I always got was well we've got too many problems here on Earth we got to solve those problems first well my response to that was well good luck because you're basically talking about altering human nature right and it's going to take something more than just some policy to alter human nature what it's going to take is some serious Consciousness excursions

<timemark seconds="7032" />

perhaps people going to space You know here we had these astronauts I'm at Edgar Mitchell years ago he's a amazing he came to my Lodge years ago Edgar Mitchell was one of the astronauts he was one of the many astronauts that went into space to deal with that ridiculous nonsense next time you about that when you met him into space and seeing God perhaps so he saw God in the sense that he got a sense without even say thank God he got a sense of the the the the the grandness you know the potential role of humans in that

<timemark seconds="7092" />

have you ever been to the Keck observatory in Hawaii now I haven't the Keck observatory in Hawaii is a very unique place cuz it's on the big island of Hawaii and it's very high up in altitude and when you get up there you actually drive through the clouds I took my family there several years ago and we were bummed out because I got so cloudy but not going to say anything but then you pop through the clouds as you continue to drive and the view is magnificent and it is to this day one of the most intense experiences consciousness-expanding experiences I've ever had I believe it without drugs like a psychedelic experience really was because the amount of that's the CAC Observatory see how it's above the clouds that's a daytime shot nine times shot because you know they set the camera aperture to capture the I didn't I had a regular camera I couldn't I couldn't really capture the the actual Stars themselves but you see the Milky Way like not lie

<timemark seconds="7152" />

that's way more intense than that you see the Milky Way in its full form you see if there's so many stars it's it's so shocking you're immediately forced to accept the reality that we're in space is it so easy and it's so it's it's in that just a photograph and that's you know obviously there's some doctoring going on so I don't know what those lines are but it's insane how intense it is it's insane and it's it's it's right above you right above us all the time that's what I love about the high desert plateaus I've got this dry atmosphere and it's like you can almost Reach Out And Touch the stars are we talking about you you've never been to La before this is your first trip to LA because when you're in California you just go to the Mojave and stare at space

<timemark seconds="7212" />

the Rocks below my feet in the Stars over my ad yeah how did you get involved in the exploration of all the stuff I guess I better time to come out of the closet like I did a little too many drugs back in the 60s and I think you did the right amount in 1969 raised enroll Minnesota and where we grew up we lived on the shores of a Puggle ml water puddle left over from the receiving of the glaciers yet, DePauw totes I call it a 3/4 of a mile long was just going to Minnesota Wisconsin's got twenty-five thousand lakes and every one of them is leftover melt water puddles from the recession of the glacier so I can still remember being like six or seven years old and my daddy telling you know once upon a time this was thousands of feet under the ice and that's how this we had land on the edge of this Lake and he was a kid I used to sit in my backyard and fish for you know

<timemark seconds="7272" />

Sunfish and crappies in Bullhead since it's a glacier 10,000 years later there's fish in there where the fuck are the fish coming from I don't know but they were there but how it wears a largemouth bass come from how what's the all this with the lake trout in the Great Lakes where the fuck do they come from if 10,000 years ago that was frozen solid frozen solid where the fuck the lake trout come from I'll have to get to work cuz I don't know the answer I need to know man I'm striking out how about northern pike I mean northern pike you go to Saskatchewan PF fly in from all over the world to go fishing up there because they have this massive population of beautiful northern pike these big girls Frozen Yes Saskatchewan was nice nice what the fuck I'm freaking out that doesn't even make sense so you saw this you were a kid

<timemark seconds="7332" />

growing up with that landscape so I got fascinated by in 1969 I went to a rock on outdoor rock concert that was at an airport called Eden Prairie that Cindy just outside of the Twin Cities Minneapolis that's on a series of Bluffs that overlooks the Minnesota River Valley right here break from the the music and the ladies and everything and I went over when standing on this book and and Jamie if you would think it's near the end of the pictures I brought for Joe I have a beautiful example of scale invariance and this is going to be similar to what I saw and and when you see it that's that's like the 25 images that's labeled for Joe

<timemark seconds="7381" />

which picture though it'll be tours and it's a picture of the Snake River

<timemark seconds="7387" />

find it the Snake River wait till you see this Joe know this is an example of scale invariance know what that means is that you know in here we go look at this what you see here working folks that are just listening to this go and see these images as it is there are they on your website I think this one is on my website River scale invariance meaning that the the river at the bottom obviously you see the lines all around it where it indicates that there was a much much larger body of water on poison snake river is about 50000 cubic feet per second right at the end of the last ice age the river here was about 30 to 40 million cubic feet per second cuz of the melting glaciers the force of the this particular was not directly fed by the melting glaciers it was the result of the catastrophic overflow of Lake Bonneville which way

<timemark seconds="7447" />

the result of massive prolonged torrential rainfall drowned all the deserts of the southerly of the western and southwestern United States there was an overflow Spillway out of the Lake Bonneville Basin in Northern Utah and it spilled over into the Snake River plain of Idaho 30 to 40 million cubic feet per second cut this channel. You'll notice that the Snake River occupies a small Channel within the big channel that scale invariance the Big River what is been about equivalent to 6 to 700 of the modern snake rivers and what you're seeing here is an example of scale invariance see the little is superimposed upon this big see now in 1969 I was standing on a bluff overlooking the Minnesota River Valley similar to this right look

<timemark seconds="7507" />

down at the little Minnesota ribbon of the Minnesota River and I had a moment and I realized I saw that this channel that this Bluff I was standing on hit once banned the bank of a gigantic River thousands of times bigger than the modern Minnesota River but I didn't know it rational in the sense that it took me another 10 or 15 years of study and research before I could go back and say yeah what my initial Instinct looking out and seeing this matching set of Bluffs for 5 miles on the other side and seeing this small version of it in the modern River

<timemark seconds="7552" />

but I was right that I remember one time in the 80s I was giving a talk on that there was a geologist in the audience and he was billions of years millions of years it took for that channel to 4 minutes said no I don't think so

<timemark seconds="7571" />

what happened was is by him challenging me it really and I said okay you know I can you know an MMA fighter getting challenged is okay I'm going to take you on you know I Rose to the occasion and I spent literally years doing research on glacial geomorphology on Paleo hydrology and of course at the end of my instincts were absolutely correct scientific he was saying was millions of years we sing that same exact channel of water had never varied and that it it just cut through over millions of years very slowly sort of that doesn't seem rational because of the width

<timemark seconds="7623" />

no it doesn't you'd have to and it doesn't it doesn't make sense so this goes along with what you were talking about earlier that the idea of these the ideas of science with that everything had taken place much like Evolution on the very gradual Pace exactly is this the Grand Canyon as well know I would so here's what I would say about the Grand Canyon

<timemark seconds="7644" />

I think that the Grand Canyon is presently we can observe it that we can reserve the Colorado River eroding the Grand Canyon however I think that the erosion of the Grand Canyon is not uniform it's episode Eric which means that the Grand Canyon has probably been there between 2 and 5 million years because for one thing the Grand Canyon wouldn't start a rotating until the Colorado Plateau 10 to 12 million years ago of the Colorado Plateau is limestone a shallow marine environment right now when it's down at marine sea level it's not in a row it's not until the whole Plateau lips up between five and ten million years ago that the downcutting can start so my take on the Grand Canyon would be that what happens is is we have you have to understand is now this is this

<timemark seconds="7704" />

emerging emerging Paradigm there two modes of change the gradualist mode that we've seen dominating through know the last few hundred years at least since the Advent of modern science and then if you want to call this a catastrophic mode where is much change is compressed into a few years or months or sometimes even days or weeks as normally would take thousands and thousands of years when I look at the Grand Canyon what I'm seeing there is episodes of catastrophic corrosion probably stretching back over two and a half million years member I said the place is he was about two and a half million years what characterizes the pleistocene from the previous pliocene is this alternating succession of glacial and interglacial ages The Swinging back and forth between these two extremes

<timemark seconds="7756" />

those episodes of transition appear to be profoundly catastrophic and they are associated with things like massive storms massive rainfalls rising and falling sea levels on a extreme basis and I think it's that that is created the Grand Canyon predominant in fact if you ever seen Grand Canyon or Gorge I could guess at that in her gorgeous probably less than a hundred thousand years old and it probably a lot of it was cut 13,000 years ago and so that's when the pleistocene ended somewhere around 10,000 years ago 10 to 13 thousand years ago wow that's a that's not a real

<timemark seconds="7805" />

I have pictures somewhere in there where you tell where you get a sense of the sedimentary rock process the downcutting the arrojan of the canyon is a different process so again it comes to a matter of perspective that we're almost incapable of I think you know academically and you could sort of explain how all this takes place in explain what's happening but in our minds are our perspective of living a hundred years looking back it's very difficult to go back 20 years ago and all I remember when that happened while barely but this is the new shitt compared to the earth the earth is just constantly changing our knowledge of human history we have the sort of static View and occasionally we have that meteor that flew over Russia recently and blew up in the sky and I was like wow

<timemark seconds="7865" />

what's up what's up and then it stops and nothing go back to work I go back to work go back to sleep. Blue Sky which blew up in the early nineteen-hundreds 1908 June 30th 1908 which just thousands and thousands of acres is 800 square miles in or 640 acres per square mile so it flattened half a million Acres on my God that was the energy of that was about to pull into a 15 Megaton bomb completely flattened gangster tree to still standing there that's how people stayed alive right because just like everybody else died or most things died and that most of the speech

<timemark seconds="7925" />

he's died a few people figured out a way to make it and then they decided to have babies but a bunch of crazy fuck could you imagine giant asteroid hits kills everybody rotten people and woolly mammoths all over the place and you're still horny be fruitful and multiply that get this the word replenish the Earth replenish the Earth and subdue it I think clearly that's it clear hint that saying this is not the primordial creation it's a subsequent creation to something previous order of things why use the word replenish be fruitful and multiply if the human population crashes in the wake of a global catastrophe at the threshold

<timemark seconds="7985" />

anything else happens

<timemark seconds="7988" />

and we want to preserve our species was probably the thing we need to be doing is having a lots of sex that's what I'm talking about yeah but screw and make scientist to figure out how to get us off this rock yeah well see be fruitful and multiply and makes Benicia replenish the Earth and subdue it what the hell is this a sub do it subdue it doesn't Genesis Genesis what the hell are they talking about there being interpreted they look you guys are the only rational species down there you've got these Big Brainz you know you got to be born before you you know you it takes you years and years to actually get where you can survive on your own because you got these big fucking brains see so we're kind of like Nature's answer to all of this only one species right now has the

<timemark seconds="8048" />

to intercede and prevent the next Global catastrophe and that's us challenge nature run its course and if 50% of the species disappear civilization is over we go back to the Stone Age struggling through existence well so be it that's what's in the cards or do we say you know what we could be in one generation be harvesting the resources of asteroids wish we could be if we had the will in the vision and the thing is is that the most dangerous asteroids are out there it's the clothes should I get to the Earth the more accessible they are and and you see we all ready to be harvested the resources of the last loaded with precious metals and nothing we are now mining from the earth that we couldn't mine from asteroids what does that suggest to you well and think about this if if I like your kind of

<timemark seconds="8108" />

imagine a scenario suppose

<timemark seconds="8111" />

we had discovered member shoemaker-levy 9 yes okay discovered in March of 1996 within about eight weeks of observations the astronomers are able to predict that these fragmenting pieces were going to orbit the Sun and come back and be crossing the orbit of Jupiter exactly the time of Jupiter was there right there was a T-bone Collision was like two vehicles coming to the intersection at the same time almost to the minute to the hemisphere what if we discovered that there's an asteroid orbiting the Sun out there that's got our number on it and it was in a strike the Earth and three years or 10 years or 20 years or whatever what would be our response to it

<timemark seconds="8155" />

what we do globally it would be there would have to be some sort of a collective extra effort the scientist from China and Russia and all these different various countries that have vast technological capabilities would probably get together and have some sort of an agreement I would think that they would have to happen and it would fact it would probably make our petty human conflicts pale into insignificance if we were faced with the demise of of our civilization or even possibly our species but suppose we discovered it and it's coming in a couple of years and there's no time to respond what could we do perhaps if we had a long enough lead time we could actually deflect all we need to do is is is an asteroid that's on a collision course with the Earth all he has to do is be nudged a little bit and a direct hit can be a wide Miss

<timemark seconds="8215" />

various potential technology we didn't have enough that it was going to slam into the Earth and for a thousand years going to be half off what would we do well perhaps we could go build a base on the moon or build something in space that would allow humans to survive at least until the dust settled enough that we could return and begin to replenish the Earth what a bummer it would be if you had a base in the moon and everyone was living there and you watch the Earth blow up total bummer but it would be even better if you didn't have it in your sitting on the earth knowing that that's it man that's all she wrote

<timemark seconds="8259" />

how many different times do you think this is happened while human beings are alive and what how does the great speculation is always been when they see the pyramids or when they see any incredible structures that we really haven't totally explain how they built

<timemark seconds="8277" />

what like Baalbek in Lebanon is what how advanced were they how advanced were they before the shit at the fan well it seems to me then an order you know you got to go primitive cultures move rocks that weighed two hundred to a thousand tons

<timemark seconds="8301" />

apparently with impunity they were doing it all over the planet right why would why would somebody be motivated again I'm a builder so I know how much work it takes to move even a year without a crane without modern technology to move a ton of taunts and again all over the world it seems to me difficult to imagine that they didn't have some kind of a technology that we forgot

<timemark seconds="8337" />

what that technology is I couldn't say but it would sure seem to me that there would be no motive for moving you know 500 tons Stones unless you had some convenient way of doing it or if it's not a convenient way of doing it just explain how an inconvenient way they could have done it when you get this something like the Acropolis or the Parthenon that's on the Acropolis right is that what is the price of the cropless is the stone in the Parthenon is with sauna is I don't know if this is the person on is one of those and impulse the Acropolis is a man-made construction that has massive massive stones that they just don't explain yeah I mean they're their there in Cusco in South America in Egypt

<timemark seconds="8390" />

are there it is a ball back one is actually probably even more impressive Jamie see if you can pull that up the stones of bald how do you spell it double a l b e k and the stones are just unbelievably big and no explanation for how they move them cut them cord them got them into place and what year it was all done right that's a One Vision of it or a picture of it but if you search for others you can say is actually close up of the actual Stones themselves and they show people standing next to Stone so you get a perspective of it much much taller than a human being exactly I think 10 or 11 ft tall and some places like there's a one rock just like who fuck move that but some of the stones did that's not a good one Jamie there's there's somewhere you can see the massive amount of of of

<timemark seconds="8450" />

stone that was in each individual one some of them are literally building sized and it's just an individual Stone and yeah there's one what the fuck is that is so big they moved that they cut that cord and moved it I mean I don't know how many people they had to do that but boy that doesn't seem like something that a society which is really concerned with feeding itself is is going to get done right so when you see like the constructions of the Great Pyramids which is one of the great wonders of the world and to this day they're always trying to come up with ways and they did it but the sheer size and put it into perspective if you cut and I think the number is 10 * 2300000 + stones in the Great Pyramid of Giza then if you cut and placed n a day it would take you 664 years

<timemark seconds="8510" />

yeah you know I haven't seen the Great Pyramid and many of the temples in Egypt I'm convinced that they had to have some means that we forgotten about transporting these Stones you know they may have used fairly primitive methods to Quarry the stones but when it comes to transporting the stones you know I mean we could imagine that they're putting them on rollers and dragging them over you know hill and dale but I can't you got to go

<timemark seconds="8545" />

really all of the whole planet

<timemark seconds="8548" />

it just it's one of those things it's like the demise of the frozen woolly mammoths there's just no real explanation and and we can invoke explanations that are basically designed to avoid the implications of admitting that there may have been Advanced knowledge scientific knowledge in prehistory and that somehow or another that knowledge was lost with it was because the burning of the Library of Alexandria or whether it was just a cataclysmic event that wiped out a mass amount of population and what was remaining was buildings like that yeah those things survived and then people tried to recreate them people eventually figured out some of the techniques and made similar structures but not over a. Of a thousand years or mm but maybe 20-30 thousand years that's always been the work of Graham Hancock the ideas and they Bounce Around

<timemark seconds="8608" />

and I remember there was that Charlton Heston narrated documentary on the Sphinx where they had gone into great detail about the erosions they brought in the geologist Robert schoch from Boston University I know Robert I want to get him on the podcast. He concluded that the temple the Sphinx the enclosure where was cut out of shows thousands of years of erosion by rainfall which there wasn't rainfall in the Nile Valley before nine thousand years ago so it predates the pyramid construction the average or the conventional dating of the pyramid there it is right there this predates the with the conventional date of the Pyramids by more than 5,000 years oh I'm convinced and I've had conversations with Robert where he will basically say he's got one number for public consumption but he's perfectly willing to admit that

<timemark seconds="8668" />

Praxis makes as much much older than that and I've what's the dark number what's the crazy number to Crazy number is tens of thousands of years if it's not that crazy though now it was kind of crazy when the Charlton Heston documentary documentary was around but now that they found go back late tapping and they know that 14012 thousand years ago whatever it was they were absolutely building these enormous the men structures that would be what 8,000 years seven thousand years earlier than the pyramids 2500 BC which may be correct but it still doesn't mean that the Sphinx wasn't way way older than exactly you know I'm convinced having seen it first-hand that that erosion is water

<timemark seconds="8728" />

I've looked at a lot of over the years and you know it's got the classic parabolic profile that you would expect if you started out with an initially Square Jamie open up the PowerPoint show entitled cataclismo Global super flood

<timemark seconds="8749" />

it's going to be my new band for the destruction of the World by water and their term see you know the Greeks believe that there are alternating destructions of the World by water and fire write that perfect porosis was the term return for the destruction of the World by fire and cataclismo of of water this stuff is so unbelievably fascinating because there's no way that you can attribute all of this stuff that means he's all of these ancient structures there's no way you can attributed to what we know about their culture we don't know enough there's just not enough evidence there's not enough we don't know enough about ancient Egypt or you know their construction methods of so much

<timemark seconds="8809" />

there's so much thinking you know I could do so much

<timemark seconds="8813" />

guess we're so much you know when you look at these giant structures and you wonder like what were they doing how did they do this who are they like it's so fascinating I would just I would love to be able to go back in time inside Giant bulletproof bubble hover over ancient Egypt Jamie go to you got the global super flooded is this image go to 58

<timemark seconds="8844" />

it's like 58 the infamous slide 58 Hangar 18 and slide 15 beautiful amazing. What you can see there is a microphone from the ditch around the Sphinx you got to remember what the sinks is that originally it was a yard dang which is which is a limestone outcrop that sticks above the surrounding landscape the yard and was the head of the Sphinx everything else was below now go to the next slide Jamie

<timemark seconds="8888" />

okay there you can really see the ditch surrounding the snakes in the layers for me to stinks body correspond to the layers in the surrounding ditch now wanted to me you'll notice the scaffolding next to the Sphinx their undertaking these campaigns of rest quote on quote restoration gross but what they're actually doing is her covering up doing that thing to try to rebuild things so stupid you're not rebuilding at your building new shitt refacing at least nobody is messing with the Quarry walls where you can see the water erosion so effectively displayed go to the next slide Jamie

<timemark seconds="8936" />

now what we see here is in abandoned Quarry it's hard to tell the scale here because that opening is like 40 feet high but if you look at you do you see this tree ations in Rockwall this is where the blocks right and remove the blocks go to the next slide Jamie

<timemark seconds="8958" />

okay this kind of shows the methodology that they use they think we're crazy separation tranches they would usually go by the the natural bedroom bedding layers of the rock go to the next slide and you'll see here here is the presumed process where they're cutting a separation trench and there's a block about to be Quarry there and then you can see the word of a stack of four blocks there in these blocks are enormous several tons looks like it's probably about 4 by 8 by probably 10 so like 320 cubic feet at 160 / so 480 so you're looking at about 57,000 lb / 2,000 say about 2

<timemark seconds="9009" />

how about 30 tons Jesus got 30 tons for that rock right there now go to the next slide 30 tonnes okay now the reason I'm showing you this is because this is the process they would have used Tacori the blocks away from the

<timemark seconds="9024" />

that the surrounding the Sphinx and exposed a quarry wall at the time that Cory wall was exposed it would have been essentially a flat surface with this slightly step profile like we saw in the photograph right now go to the next slide

<timemark seconds="9040" />

right so there is now it would be a cross-section with all of the blocks removed okay go to the next slide and what we have here is Stone pick marks in a limestone lets you got Corey from Rama seed times about 1200 BC for 3,200 years and seems like they used some sort of a chisel to get that out the marks are still visible marks in a quarry from the early New Kingdom Circa 1500 3500 years ago you can actually determine the type of tool that they used to Corey the Rocks the pics are the chisels go to the next one from the marks marks or pick marks made by Stone pics in an Old Kingdom Limestone Quarry 2000 years BC so here's a 4000 year old quarry

<timemark seconds="9100" />

exposed to the desert elements and the pick marks are still visible on the face now go to the next slide. Here's the Spanx go to the next slide and look at that Corey wall this crazy crazy does that make sense the only way it would make sense as if there was a vastly different type of stone well it's not though it's it's the same it's it's a well-integrated limestone Robert can tell you all about the composition of that Stealth cam position does some of its going to be a softer Limestone absolutely certainly looks to the Layman I'm clearly a Layman but it certainly looks like like water Fishers like figures that are are from

<timemark seconds="9160" />

even to the trained eye it looks like water but some legit Egypt I'll just in even legit geologist have tried to attribute this to wind and sand

<timemark seconds="9173" />

well I didn't you know Robert de Chao pictures of the comparison of wind erosion to Santa Rosa or water erosion it ain't into a tribute this to wind and sand it's not based on the scientific evidence of what it looks like when there's water erosion it's to confirm or to conform with a the known or establish timeline of construction and that's why I told you those examples of other quite like that Old Kingdom Corey that's almost the same age is actually really not scientific to try to attributed to wind and sand it's just your what you're doing is confirming to confirmation bias he hasn't given ID in your head and your ear trying to to make this really odd a rosian fit into that doesn't look like when they go to the next flight

<timemark seconds="9233" />

now go to the next slide and you'll see what I've done is superimposed what the original profile would it look like and there's been an enormous amount of rock Limestone rock removed and we know the profile would have looked like that because the stones that were quarried are what make up the Sphinx in Bali temples right but Nails have been eroded as well but unfortunately they're covered that up with this reconstruction and most likely most likely and I think Robert would confirm this that the Limestone blocks it Formed those temples were sheathed in hard Granite whereas this Quarry wall was not it was exposing is also the issue of the Sphinx head itself which seems to have been altered this this is a timeline thing that folks may or may not know but there's been

<timemark seconds="9293" />

Egypt changed quite a bit in Egypt ancient Egypt was around for thousands and thousands of years and it's some point they were conquered by the Nubians and the the the more African what we think of as traditional African fate obviously Egypt is part of Africa but the more traditional looking African faces is what you see in the current face in the temple to spank so probably what it happened is a later date Farrell said you don't want fuck this line I want my face up there so they put the face of this probably Katherine and I think both you and Anthony Weston Robert schoch we can sure what that's why there's so little erosion on that face right cuz that face is only a few thousand years old and why would be disproportionately small compared to the rest of the body so fascinating would give so much to know what they knew then I ever heard any point in time to go back in human history and just be able to observe that would be the time that the just a middle of Egypt I would love to see you

<timemark seconds="9353" />

look like before they raided it and took off for fo'c'sle know it was covered in smooth Limestone and they they cut it all up to build Cairo they raided it yeah there was an earthquake the flat in Cairo and you know they had attempted to penetrate the Great Pyramid prior to that without success but apparently the earthquake which I think happened I think it happened in the 12th century Lucinda few rocks from near the top of the pyramid that allowed them to get some levers in there and begin to pry him loose so I've read a bunch of fucking assholes talk about vandalism that get this whether this is true or not we have no way of knowing but there are Arabic accounts and counts of early Travelers and pretty much they are unanimously declared that the entire outside of the pyramid was inscribed

<timemark seconds="9406" />

now think about that what in the hell would that have been telling what kind of message was that there was being sent to the Future my hair stands up on my legs just thinking about its scribed yeah Hey listen there's rocks in space and occasionally they land and when they do your fucked build one of these get inside wait for further instruction

<timemark seconds="9436" />

it's amazing bushed there I mean if that thing existed as your Robert schoch is corrected nothing existed before the Holocene events that those are the only types of structures that would still be here to people make it through their wonder what the number was Adam and Eve story all over the world we have Traditions about Caddis catastrophes and cataclysms and giant floods all over the world. Of deviation but there's also a lot of similarity in them the idea that a small group had some kind of foreknowledge you know whether was Noah in the Bible or deucalion Indie Greek myths or Pierce them in the Sumerian myths or is this a thrift store Manu I mean to culture Heroes that survived these great cataclysmic floods are in the dozens and dozens right American

<timemark seconds="9496" />

Traditions about Giants when the famous Indian artists around living with various Indian tribe Spike 40 years painting and and in writing about him very interesting quote in one of his books he says that they were widely Divergent with traditions and language and customs and so on but of 120 tribes that he visited they all had one thing in common that they were descended from survivors of some gigantic cataclysmic event

<timemark seconds="9536" />

that's American Indian do you find it in North America you find it in South America you find it in the Polynesian Islands you find it in Australia Japan I mean it's around the entire planet this idea and now modern science is confirming what we assumed was merely some kind of superstitious nonsense of you know pre-scientific illiterate barbarians and we're realizing that those myths and no stories and epic tales that are handed down for centuries and centuries actually contain hard scientific truth from surviving eyewitnesses these craters actually do exist and they do right. Awesome craters undeniable you clear glass throughout Europe undeniable human beings were alive and human beings were alive then they got fucked up there's no doubt about yeah they have suffered enormously and just like you know if if you know if three

<timemark seconds="9596" />

the species of animals in North America went extinct do you think that the 25% surviving came through completely unscathed know it simply means that there's a threshold above which a species is viable it can survive there's an inn below which you know there may have been survivors but there just weren't enough of them they were too widely scattered serious habitat loss which would have diminished food supply and they just died out but either directly or indirectly as a result of these catastrophic environmental changes he had to have been affected by this and all of the myths and the stories would totally concur with that idea you know that there were humans and enter all consistent with this one detail that there were some humans that had foreknowledge and so they built Arts to Kelly and built an ark just like Noah did the Pistons built an ark zysa first built an ark man who built an ark

<timemark seconds="9657" />

where are these stories coming from you know are they just completely conjured up independently of one another and that detail is just thrown in or is there some kind of a reality behind this that there were people who had foreknowledge if there were people that had foreknowledge it says yes to suggest to me that there were two groups of survivors those who survived because they intentionally plan to survive they had foreknowledge they took steps to secure their survival in Freemasonry there so the account of Islamic or the account of Enoch there's variances on it but he knocked the story of Enoch in the Masonic tradition says that Enoch had you know he was in the end of the Patriarchs before Noah had this for knowledge if the world was going to be destroyed by fire or flood it was deep underground it was it was preserved within nine layers of stone it was nice

<timemark seconds="9717" />

find layered Vault and you only unless you had the key to accessing to access this vault which was now like a time capsule that preserved the science in the knowledge into wisdom of the pre diluvian world or pre-flood world

<timemark seconds="9735" />

he then set up two pillars pillar brass in the pillar of Marvel the pillar of brass designed to withstand the effects of the cataclysm the watery destruction the pillar of marble if I'm remembering it right was to withstand the the the destruction by fire so there were these two pillars that basically informed any survivors that there was this 9 chambered underground Vault that contained the secrets of the previous World age that his what's coming to a past and that's an intrinsic part of masonic tradition in fact the whole the Sonic symbolism is based around bad idea and dumb and it has parallels throughout other Traditions as well well what I'm getting at here is if if there was some people who had foreknowledge of it and took steps to survive

<timemark seconds="9785" />

they were the ones to preserve the knowledge of the pre that the previous step the antediluvian World Order

<timemark seconds="9793" />

the other survivors just survived by the luck of the draw like that tree standing there right they just happened to be in the right place at the right time they survived but now they are going to be the ones you're going to be wholly preoccupied simply with the task of surviving finding enough food to eat in shelter because clearly the planetary environment was going through all kinds of changes the other group it take an actual steps to survive and preserve knowledge now when we look at the beginning of recorded history 4,000 5,000 years ago we're basically half way back through polishing right okay let's for purposes of conjecture assume that the end of the Holocene human population crashed

<timemark seconds="9839" />

well if you want to build a pyramid or a great Temple You've got to have a labor force right well if you got standard bands of survivors you basically are going to be able to accomplish that now let's assume that you've got two groups of humanity want it sitting there with all of this knowledge at their disposal just like imagine it if our modern society was wiped off the face of the Earth but somebody somewhere in some deep cave underground was able to preserve our knowledge of physics and chemistry and in the various Sciences obviously in order to run this computer that we're running here to do this broadcast requires an intact huge intact infrastructure right but we could know how to build a computer we could know how to do how to broadcast but if we don't have the infrastructure we're just sitting on information right well let's assume that you have a group that survived right and they've got their the custodians of this body of knowledge right now it takes 3000 4000

<timemark seconds="9899" />

5000 years for the human population to reconstitute itself and now you got a labor force and let's suppose that there's going to be another cataclysm impending you know such as the one day perhaps cause that did the Noah's flood which you know there's evidence now that around 5,000 years ago there was an asteroid impact into the Indian Ocean right that plunge through 2 miles of ocean water in plastic 1200 it would have created tsunamis well on the island of Madagascar on the southern island of Madagascar and it should be in this

<timemark seconds="9944" />

in this program that we've got open right here Jamie if you go to slide number

<timemark seconds="9953" />

there go to slide number 111

<timemark seconds="9958" />

it's so ironic that today our focus is closer and closer to the cloud closer and closer to chips to solid state hard drives all these different things that is not going to last right no paper no but no one's carbon a thing and stone you know that the knowledge that we have is like how much of what would everybody is on hard drives I mean how much of what everybody has is in the cloud on a you-know-what on a server somewhere and who the fuck is going to be able to figure out how to read that shit a thousand years from now it just like we're trying to figure out how to read Egyptian 11 now wish I had my pointer here go to the next slide so you can see we okay right there you see you see those ugly things it's water ocean water that washed on land

<timemark seconds="10018" />

and washed up and you see it kind of comes to a point and then it washed back out this is this is a tsunami deposit and those features that you're looking at that kind of looks like this fish called chevron's right that's what happens when the water washes in makes deposits of giant Ripples and it washes back out what kind of timeframe we talked about in this house wants us to do that

<timemark seconds="10046" />

hours so that all happened in our sin hours yum you could still see it today go to the next slide Jamie

<timemark seconds="10053" />

we're getting a closer up look here now you see how see how they're shaped almost be like that's the Chevron like a sergeant stripe almost right okay go to the next slide

<timemark seconds="10065" />

okay here's a cross-section of one of those v-shaped Hills 600 ft and height that's incredible so those images right there but we're seeing if it looks like the effects of a river or water or something but water from the ground it looks like Hills 600 feet high so you're talking about massive amount of water we're talkin about it who's minimum run up hills 600ft massive amount of weight and Devastation and this is all five thousand years ago

<timemark seconds="10113" />

keep ya there's Madagascar location of the Chevrons on the southern edge of Madagascar let's he go to slides up

<timemark seconds="10124" />

and over on the other side at the same age if we look at the southwestern Coast of Australia I think the next slide will get a closer in view there we go you see that splooge text text to technical scientific term you can see it's very clear they're okay that's the other side of the ocean so the other side of the ocean directly opposite of where this thing impacted impact in the middle and she crash epic wave wave next slide directions

<timemark seconds="10174" />

can we read that yeah the southern end of Madagascar Live for enormous wedge-shaped deposits called chevron's that are composed of material from the ocean floor each covers twice the area of Manhattan with sediment as deep as the Chrysler Building is high on close inspection to Chevron deposits contain deep ocean microfossils that are fused with medley of metals typically form by Cosmic impacts holy shit yeah yeah holy shit and so that if that happened 4800 years ago. What kind of an impact with diamonds hide on human civilization do to help me some of the facts most extreme weather events hurricanes torrential rain falls

<timemark seconds="10234" />

<timemark seconds="10353" />

yeah cuz I've done lots and lots of field exploration and I have thousands of images of just awesome stuff does sacred geometry have anything to do with this stuff or is that a totally different as we've inherited this Corpus of ancient knowledge sacred geometry is one of the keys for deciphering these ancient traditions because of these Ancient Temple structures which are the textbooks in stone if you will have several components in in common astronomical and geometrical being the two predominant and if you understand the geometry you realize the geometry is like a universal code by where we're about you can preserve certain types of information because geometry is universal don't matter what your spoken language is the principles of geometry are what they are you know the relationship of a of a radius to a circle is the same and it doesn't matter what culture you come from UC and

geometry is a critical means of deciphering the the knowledge that and I think that the that the predominant way of preserving ancient knowledge is in the temple structures and they have to be looked at his text books and stone and once we begin to realize that then we can go it's like when you go to Egypt it's not just the hieroglyphs that's a part of it but it's also to geometry and the astronomy ditch encoded there and we can see the same astronomy at work whether we're looking in Egypt weather in Geometry or whether we're looking at megalithic structures in ancient England or whether we're looking at make a Monumental Earthworks up in the Ohio Valley or looking at this the mind you been to Chichen Itza right okay that whole complex he was laid out according to principles of sacred geometry and astronomy and it's exactly the same principles underlying that is we find in Egypt that will be our next conversation
