hilarious guy of fun dude a very original person I don't know anybody else like Theo Von other than Theo Von so please give it up

<timemark seconds="430" />

but the oh Bond

<timemark seconds="433" />

The Joe Rogan Experience

<timemark seconds="442" />

professional does professional turn that bitch down down huh a non-professional of some of his half-assing it to keep that phone up really yeah I've seen that some people keep that phone up the check that for a long time to check in the mail podcast Russell Peter can't leave his phone alone for Rihanna impossible he's checking things out some did you read off tweet since I owe people of Doug Benson used to do that

<timemark seconds="474" />

that's why I'm trying to get away from it if I can I find X if I'm going to go eat now I'll even leave it in my phone in the car Power move and I hadn't done that before I just started and it's not even a Natural Choice I'm making almost it's like something I need to do to chickenshit move or are you scared scared to leave it in there yeah scared scared to leave that phone blew some important I need to know but there's a reason there is a thing like what if something important happens yeah but what is do you think like when does that happen super rare but if it did happen when your phone was in the car and somebody needed you you feel terrible right but you got to just what is the what's the balanced like so slippery we don't have any way to get in touch with the back in the day you had to yell for Help number that they can yell at me or not in Los Angeles there's too many people yell for help nobody

<timemark seconds="528" />

and someone would just help me in something else I think it's you know something not good or something in Arabic or something people fuck you up just make that up

<timemark seconds="537" />

I'm not sure honestly I think I might have heard that because I live in Westwood and we have is very diverse over there is a lot of people as soon as yelling stuff in the street do you think for real do you think help mean something bad in other languages is that real somebody told me Hello means go to hell in like Greek or Latin like like politics means like like like something like not good like something tick like a tick like a blood-sucking really government or something like that start with one let's start with the

<timemark seconds="575" />

should we go with Halo first yeah I think cuz and I just say things and I don't even know sometimes think it's somebody just told me to say hello when I was young and I've been saying in my whole life but what does help mean is help mean anything in another language is help a bad word in other languages

<timemark seconds="593" />

so I'm looking up if the word help mean something in another language not right there were help for the word help mean something in another language that you have to wear that uniquely I think cuz it's that's a hard one that's

<timemark seconds="611" />

that's me I don't even know anymore now it's translation maybe in Arabic or something I'm not in any sort of alternate meanings and other languages yeah I'm not accusing anybody there a beach in there whatever or whatever you know Arabic and Hebrew like those old old languages have the coolest letters right things like to look at some old Hindi script or something like that why is that looks so cool it's like a mystery but now look at the crazy little letter they have like look at that like this like some alien writing yeah I'll be furious and I couldn't I couldn't imagine having to learn some of the other languages you know I am going to China next week and want to Shanghai and I'm like

<timemark seconds="662" />

it makes me look and around a different drawings you know like as far as even though it words go it's going to be seem to have a lot of stuff in English there oh yeah a lot of lot of countries where tourism they just put stuff in English English seems to be the language that most European countries like most people know you could you can kind of get by and you in Italy you can kind of get by in Germany they just speak English it's it's it's really interesting man cuz it's because I guess there's so much tourism and I guess everyone's worried about us as we have the nuclear bombs everybody learned English and when we travel to a lot cuz we have more money here probably so we have the ability to go places maybe do you like English yeah I like it but it's just weird how much cooler other languages look when they're written out I guess it just cuz what we're accustomed to

<timemark seconds="718" />

but I look at Thai writing or like the I was sweating I tried to read someone time and tie I was sweating by the end of it crazy that it took me out of my element man with a couple of a couple of words off of it you know I was needed help Asian characters look like if you had a movie like a science fiction movie and in the movie they found a crashed UFO and I had some writing on the i-beams or something like that would look like a lot Asian writing right it would look like something something crazy from Asia that like you like what am I looking at right like a lie you see you saying it might as well be alien writing if you don't know it yet they were alien writing you think it's going to look up more like something from Asian writing it is from American writing weird if it was like

<timemark seconds="769" />

comic book font yeah whatever alien speak English but the man that's the biggest man fuck that I ever heard was that because the size of infinity not only is there another Theo Von out there in the world but their cousin finity is so big I'm going to butcher this for sure we talked about this a little bit by a little bit someone has done the exact same thing as an exact same order down to the last millisecond do you believe it do you

<timemark seconds="810" />

okay so that's something that you think or is that something that you think that could be really true I think it could be really true but honestly my brains not really strong enough to compute that so I would have to take many many many hours to really thinking about what that means is right now I'm sent you what I'm saying I'm not it's one of those well dude things like I'm saying it but I'm not really thinking it through yeah how much you really thinking through you just a couple steps you're not really thinking okay that there's a so then that means for you there's another there's another man out there who did comedy at the last night at The Comedy Store who wore did the exact same set tripped over the exact same words spilled his water the same way every it supposed to be everything and not now that because Infinity so big there supposed to be an infinite number of those people out there yeah I don't want that I don't man cuz I would hurt my feelings honestly would make me feel

<timemark seconds="865" />

I think it makes sense are they make sense I think the universe is so big right I mean everything so big just what we know about our solar system so big it's so big that alone is crazy the idea that there's no end of the crazy we're like no no it's got to be in the end that's too crazy crazy when it comes to the universe the universe is crazy there is nothing about it that makes any sense it's so crazy that we don't like to think about it last night I was watching the fireworks in the fireworks going off and I was thinking yeah this kind of cool you know what's cooler the fucking billions of flying explosions that are above our heads they have the free fireworks at our car. It's like we just won't we'll get together for like some something made in Honduras but the fact that there are like shooting stars every night

<timemark seconds="925" />

street lights we don't see the craziest light show ever which is the Milky Way yeah you know when you drop make that drive like out to Vegas or you know in to be driving through Montana at night or something like that you pull over what is that said fireworks from last night at least half of them are illegal right I would say most of them looks like a lot of Civil War artwork firefighter that has got to be a crazy time but some of them get off I think on Fires like some of my thing they want a little bit of how you don't think yes well it's been proven that some people that are mentally ill that become fireman actually start fires something you know it's not it's not 99.999% of them or one of the numbers but he casually and every line of work you needed someone is crazy yeah and I could see that dude you want something

<timemark seconds="985" />

morning you don't have a lot of money or anything like that that's all we just did one they're crazy yeah you know they just some people there's something wrong or just connections that are being made in there and then knock the date they're capable of doing things just to deceive people rip people off or they're capable of doing things for their own personal gain like lighting a building on fire just so they can put it out right I just some people that are just broken like there's something about them that's just not connected right yeah we should shut them down man I think I think in the future we have to have some better programs to find out who's just not even care about people who doesn't care about people because you don't care about people then

<timemark seconds="1031" />

it's just not then you shouldn't be here you should be somewhere else you should be in a place where they don't have any people you know that's just a dangerous thing to have around for the most part it's fine right cuz life is fairly easy in civilized times right most of the stuff is fine most of the stuff without you know the caveat for the occasional chaos but it's just fucking it's hard to tell how crazy people are until something really happens and me and you really need to count on them and when they let you know when you're pinned underneath the dress when they look at you and they just run out of the room and just take off in like you're not even help me there's people like that do you think some of those people didn't even know their that they would do that until the situation arises that that sometimes why I would love to have some and I know this sounds a little dark but like to have some serious stressors in our world to find out even who I really am you know like to see who Rises to like the way you are inside yeah like what Rises to the core of my skin and says this is who I am you know I got trapped

<timemark seconds="1091" />

better once do with like 7 or 8 people a kind of sounds like a small idea but this is like 3 hours right and suddenly look at first one dude kind of verbose he suddenly like I'm the leader but like an hour later he's like to fuck a couple chicks are also stuck in the elevator and you start to see like okay when he was trying to fuck them like it was hitting on them or is trying to actually get down in the elevator know he was going to fucking other but he was maybe going to fuck him later if they got out of the elevator safely not like a raper like a guy who's like going to date him or I take him to dinner and then hopefully have sex in them at some point if they want to as well but she be on say yes consensual sex yeah but he but you started to see who was who like one guy was like just literally wouldn't listen anyone try to rip the doors open for 2 hours if it's like just like just like gave up on that likes one lady was really scared like a mediately it started too kind of fold out who is going to be who you know I wouldn't know what to do I don't know if you don't think you're supposed to cry

<timemark seconds="1151" />

mouth though it seems like death right I climb out of that shaft supposed to stay I mean they must have some sort of regular but you know of an elevator in one of the UFC hotels like real far and fucked up CB dollaway one of the UFC fighters his back is fucked up from that apparently apparently he suing I know I don't think he fought that day I think they had to cancel his fight I think I might be wrong about that but I know his back was like significantly fucked up not fall elevators make it too easy man I miss the old days sometimes when you do this

<timemark seconds="1192" />

he scratch from the fight yeah he's bought sense but I think he still having problems with his back yeah yeah it's hard to fix to a back to one of the hardest one of the hardest things to make better again seems like every time people get surgery it's just a slippery slope it's very rare that someone get surgery on their back and they go all my back's great now everything's fine it's always like yeah I got to go in again I got another disk can I call no in the state they're literally getting her back fused from top to bottom of dudes would like 4-5 fake discs and their back that are still fighters to you have no one has several fused in his neck he has artificial spacers from where the discs used to be he has that in his back is multiple operations on his back do you think that that like cuz some people think like you know a lot of your chi in your like lineup isn't you know like your do you think that that cash all-tourney of it yeah

<timemark seconds="1252" />

I don't know I don't know if that's real I don't know what is that is it is it the actual disc gelatin or is the spine itself a spinal column where all the all the nerves are firing all the way up to the brainstem yeah it's really fucking crazy thing to risk have you think that about that like the connection between your brain and then that cord that goes to all your body and everything move and it's all just this back area that very few people ever even exercise yeah just so crazy everybody's doing all these the shit to get your biceps looking fly and pump your tits up and very few people are concentrating on like lower back exercises reverse and capers protecting your spine put muscle all around that bitch work that core if you like the Kettlebell windmills you ever do kettlebell windmills dude

<timemark seconds="1312" />

Tony touch your touch the ground by your foot and it's a while for your spine with all the muscles around your back that stabilize everything and your obliques in your abs all your core great exercise I got to do more like a dolt Fitness man I got a g up a little bit that's what it looks like damn look at all that shit at the human spine so I can eat this in China next week dude in a weird way they can you can have dick over there somebody said they said that and he's eating a lot of boys eating everywhere Andrew Zimmerman I think that's all the stuff that's fire in your nerves that's crazy and what is that what is that even look like it almost looks like a jellyfish or like a it looks like it's reaching for something doesn't it yeah shooting off of the cosmos Sun

<timemark seconds="1372" />

I had a dream of the top is making nuclear bombs I think it's the top is making 4G cell phones and 40 megapixel front facing cameras time machines that fucking thing is making satellite transmission of video signals and spontaneously delivered two televisions worldwide that's what that thing's making dude your things making Tesla's death raris steroids Oxycontin everything about the human brain areas that we can go out that's making whiskey that thing's making cry cry cry

<timemark seconds="1416" />

that thing's making nail polish and fake tits that thing is off the check if you left it if you like to the human brain feel like all this shit is responsible for you black one. Area oh my God and it looks like something you would think maybe we can even do nothing to you walk by that on the street and you didn't know is a brain you be like all man just one of my favorite out here is Mars Attacks where they have the Earth exposed Brain Attack

<timemark seconds="1453" />

this is one of the greatest movies of all time it's Tim Burton right is that who I believe it is about write that down cuz I want some amazing it's so good place to obviously different people of a really but it's obviously the same guy playing two people and it's never brought up so it's a great movie Manna made it is a great great movie dude it's so good as early it seems like it looks back at you watching her but it's all I want purpose on purpose it's like window when this it's what it is is they somehow or another captured how we feel about this time. They captured it with this weird like Vegas thing with this is the president back then and when these aliens come off the spaceship it's just something about the way they moved it makes you think like you're watching a movie from the 50s but still really good like Josh good enough but what he did by making the

<timemark seconds="1513" />

affects weird and barely real is he almost gave you a Nostalgia for like 1960s 1970s movie can see that a little bit right here. It's better right it's way better than anything they were capable of I mean look at the fucking the Shadows on the head and everything like that watch a little bit of this real quick this is when they first land

<timemark seconds="1538" />

we come in peace peace

<timemark seconds="1551" />

girl from Mars

<timemark seconds="1558" />

that's cool do you think you need something from Mars if they had like a fat say this cuz I know you like to be a while. Either I've seen some of the stuff you eat you know you eat kind of rare you know you know you know you're not afraid to eat the rare and will you have on say this they catch a Omar's donkey or something you know and they're just they're serving of you don't even know what's in it for a donkey from Mars Reddit how many pounds of that but I would need it no chance first of all first of all people going to be definitely mad at you you think people are mad at you for eating animals on Magic Nails from space only one to be so fucking mad at you second of all I would want I would not want to be an early adopter of Mars meat really want to see these people that are convinced that meat I don't agree with them but these people are convinced that mean is bad for you than meat itself is bad for you cuz a lot of people that eat meat wind up

<timemark seconds="1618" />

heart disease problem is that they're not really measuring just the meat they just measuring people that eat meat what else to eat I eat a lot of sugar you have a lot of bread you have a lot of pasta you eat a lot of this and all you drink honies yeah you might have you might smoke cigarettes so it's hard to tell I think different things are also good for different people but people can't even agree on whether or not it's healthy to eat meat there's some people that disagree on it right what time you want to wait

<timemark seconds="1650" />

to see what Mars me but there's a thing year profile fucking donkeys from Mars eaters looks like a little bit of Stardust steak or something out um are the only have one but I'm saying that one donkey job but it could be like some prions getting your system you got mad cow disease but you could also what if you adopt a superpower by eating it that's good true that's one thing that nobody ever brings up with like nuclear energy like all this all these like nuclear disasters and what is terrified of mutations and radioactive waves and all the other ships going to fuck this up but nobody remembers comic books for every single time somebody got hit with some radioactive shit they became a superhero. That's never happened here I wonder if I can handle it if I had a superpower I just feel like I would tell everyone it wouldn't be able to keep it a secret

<timemark seconds="1709" />

some dudes they just tell everybody right like Hooch it who doesn't have to keep it a secret obviously the thing he can't keep his secret what is that at the big Ax Men they like to hide but the thing doesn't hide the saying is just that's what he's covered in rocks you know where the hell yeah oh yeah I know he is now the big giant whale song do you know that when they did The Incredible Hulk TV show they changed his name from Bruce to David because people thought Bruce was gay I really was a lot of bruises guy then the stereotypical name a comedian would do a hack joke about a gay guy they like Bruce Randy Randy Randy really but Bruce it's always been

<timemark seconds="1769" />

the name that they would use so apparently people in the you know what it was is the 70s when the Hulk TV show was wrong with Lou Ferrigno oh yeah yeah they just decided like hey let's change it change it make it David David Banner and we also comic book dorks like me were like what how dare you how dare you change his name that was the best show ever cuz it made it feel like if you were ugly you can still be cool and do nice stuff I felt like you could be this nerdy guy and you get picked on by these assholes and you just fucking Hulk out become bulletproof yeah I met him at the post office one time lady friend and I've been his wife I think he's still yoked as fuck is jacked like you know he looks really good like you looks healthy to it's crazy yeah me and the dude got it

<timemark seconds="1829" />

play Pandora 60s but he looks very healthy you might wonder who who I wonder if you're going to start living like a really long time there dairy looks a little bit more more reasonable yeah I'm not look he was a gigantic supersize human at one point in time you know money that's what he used to look like that big so when you saw him on the Hulk the problem was he couldn't really be that defined for long periods of time and film Attalla Vision show cuz it was too unhealthy super unhealthy when those guys are like right about to pose down when they're about to die are on death store they are really unhealthy to get lightheaded look at that dude old as fuck who is that dude holding jacked the Willie Nelson. Because I got a 75 year old Jack man she didn't they have those do you eat that roast a that guy gets shot and killed dude depends how far I am from syphilis

<timemark seconds="1889" />

okay let's say you're far man I need them I need them if it was but whether not eating them or not surviving getting home to my family or something like that a little bit of some if you don't mind is that okay okay so a ship went down a shuttle an Airship or something a plane and you know like that movie alive right you're out there do you or you the shaft you know you're going to eat it you know you're going to eat well it's whether or not the bodies like the people killed her at it the real problem is people start killing people needing people then you got a real problem okay people already killed people already dead but it's two senior citizens that's it is a small plane well you got to decide people can live without food for several weeks especially if you're the average American you got a lot of fat in your body after a day or so your body kicks into fat burning

<timemark seconds="1940" />

ketosis mode but you ain't hungry though you're going to be hungry but you will be less hungry believe it or not after the first day once your body kicks into fat burning like if you ever been on a fat burning diet I was just on Paleo from a little different so pale you're still eating a lot of carbohydrates just cut down all the grains things like that yeah when you go on a fat burning diet one of the first things that happens is your appetite just changes radical it's really weird but you just stop being hungry the same way like hunger is in a desperation thing like when I know when I'm not ketogenic because then my Hunger gets desperate like I have to eat something I never feel like that with keto it's like I'm hungry but I'm okay it's like and through the day like energy level that much more stabilized. That's what I felt like on Paleo I've never done anything like that mean I lost 11 pounds of something I was supposed to lose I can't really have like a plan or anything but next thing you know like I felt I never felt like I had to eat I feel like I needed to eat to get to the next few

<timemark seconds="2000" />

my life but I didn't feel like okay I got to make a big deal about eating it felt more like a survival technique like eating all day and and and then my mind I felt I did he feel more energy I never felt like that occur after eating always feel like okay I could eat and then still go do something I can go you know play cars are running around or chase a friend or do anything you know hang out yeah the first of all talk to everybody about how I'm not cuz you got like I said you got 2 weeks right you a 2-weeks your body can just go on fat eating itself sides of your body start eating itself okay you got to talk to people and say listen this person is dead okay this is just meet now that can Keep Us Alive and we can survive and we could see our family and our friends or we can not eat this person and we take a chance on going hungry and we might

<timemark seconds="2060" />

too weak to get out of here like you have to think like what if what if you can get saved but you have to be able to hike out 30 miles in the mountain either going to die or you going to live okay he's the only two things that could possibly happen the internet even matter that point so you got to figure out is it even possible that you can live is it possible yeah you might be might not be you might be in the mountains in the winter with nothing around you to eat no way for you to get off the mountain cuz it's too dangerous because you get clipped out every time I try to go down and then try to get back up and you can't get back up you stalk you could fall and die it happens to people all the time so it's it might not be that you can make it but if you are going to make it out you're going to want to have some energy

<timemark seconds="2108" />

and different people have different Fitness levels obviously so some people like they're not even going to be capable of hiking out what if you take a lunch and you know what to eat the whole person right there like you guys could eat them in parts for sure what would you have is a psychologically devastating the thought of just eating human meat it psychologically devastating you you're crossing a threshold that you know you're in you're into that so dark are two minutes everything everything it's sad it's crazy and it's also a rich part of you know Human Adventure history there was always like you're running the cannibals and I was like a big part of those crazy movies about oh yeah I got eaten by cannibals all of them did it was cannibals are my God Joe Versus the Volcano remember that I don't remember that I think he came across cannibals

cannibalism amongst Native Americans like Native Americans would cannibalize settlers to go with some of them like the Nez Perce Indians Steve rinella was telling me about that they would cut dudes up and eat

<timemark seconds="2182" />

like woah that's a crazy imagine you have some dude goes down in Euless and is a part you already know you like it like I'm cutting this dude's ass and I'm having a little bit of fucking ligament right here on this Hillside off man the guy got killed by a polar bear yesterday in front of his kids in Canada he was protecting his kids from the polar bear

<timemark seconds="2205" />

and he died 31 year old dude

<timemark seconds="2210" />

you know what that's a hero that mean his kids will think of him as a hero I bet he lives in that same place where those people live on that Life Below Zero I think it's called Noonie of that

<timemark seconds="2220" />

if that's where he lives he lives I mean he lives in a really really remote area that has polar bears polar bears to the most dangerous bear you could ever run into cuz they're the only animal that all all of them actively hunt people really knew now but that's the place where was everything that they don't don't have any vegetables up there so they don't do the only a hundred percent carnivorous Bear all they need is me every other bear is like eating berries and bears oh ignore you if they forget a whole feel very well I want to chase you asshole and chew your bones and all that bullshit I'm just going to eat berries what does this have this lady Bears I did some Beres laying on his back fields of blueberries you find bears just snacking away having a great time eating blueberries I'll do it all day not polar bears polar bears eat your ass hole kill you

<timemark seconds="2280" />

I would hate that that I would hate if I'm someone's trying to eat me man I would just be so upset I think you see that lady that got in trouble cuz she got a giraffe giraffe it's everybody's freaking out on her

<timemark seconds="2296" />

it seems sad man that giraffe seem like it probably was going to do to her it's not going to do anything to her for sure it's it is rare for an animal to get that old it's 18 years olds real dark your head dark skin or something a little bit of the old males to get dark this that's super cool one thing though that people need to know see all these things are complicated they're not as simple as everybody wants to think they are in this is one of the things it's complicated about this store is that that's your app is killing little giraffes

<timemark seconds="2327" />

it's a normal thing the old bowls like that one which is a big massive 18 year old animal okay shoot shoot animal he just was not having it with these young ones coming up not having it what do you think it is jealousy or anger it's just nature you know they they kill off the younger male oh yeah like pissed at the neighbor kids kind of thing just don't want anybody taking their spot they don't know that they're riding off into the sunset like he's not a viable breeding male anymore but I still huge so at 18 years of age he had killed off three young bowls so they were going to have to kill him right cuz it's not good you need the Bulls to keep the thing alive species of giraffe that already has a population problem is not a lot of them and if he's killing off these young Bulls each one of those young boys could have fathered countless children yeah they're missing all these future children for one bull can't even breathe anymore and he's going to continue to

<timemark seconds="2387" />

he was seeking out the young bull killed three but this is not a cut-and-dry thing I don't think it looks cool to pose with a rifle and a giraffe and it mean there's something about giraffes that are so gentle that they let kids feed them when you go to the fucking zoo right I don't so I get why people get upset but when you do find out what it actually is you know this is not as this is more complicated than that I'm seeing on the surface it's not simply a cruel person shot a giraffe and we should be angry at her eyes it's like they had to shoot that giraffe because it was killing other giraffes so is it appropriate the way she celebrated it that's when you have to wonder you're eating it mean to 800 lb of meat or something like that out of that. Wow

<timemark seconds="2439" />

two huge animal I think was more than that Denise a 2,000 pounds of meat I think it's a 4000 pound animal and they got 2,000 pounds of me which they give to all the villages all the people there and I know people like I don't give a fuck you shouldn't shoot a draft but I feel the same way because when I see a giraffe I don't think of it as something I want to shoot and eat I think it was something a little kid can feed at the fucking zoo cuz they're so gentle they're so gentle that they like people feed them oh yeah they had a thing by our home and I was growing up they had a thing to do that a couple giraffes out there a couple of lambs and shit get out there and buy a little cup of corn and go out there and you enough to know it like you have to sign a waiver you have to do anything you not to fucking be able to read very well and you can fucking feed a giraffe you know point blank is the only animal that is a wild African animal that we let kids feed at the fucking zoo little kids can feed them yeah I can't believe it is that much I mean when I hear that for one the lady what did she why did she have to put that picture out what was in it for her to do that

<timemark seconds="2499" />

well he even knew like she's a hunter and she was excited that you got to kill a big giraffe you know and you know it gets its it's strange when you just kill a bunch of things and make stuff trophies and you put them in your trophy room and you go well I want to get it now I want to get a ram okay I got a ram now I want to get a mountain good I'll get it you got like this Menagerie inside of your your house yeah that's a good dark man I want to get a mouse and I want to get step dad and I want to get a second okay but if you're eating all of those things and this is how you get your meat yeah is that okay it's okay but there's something we need something we all have a strange feeling about the sea ideas that people are killing these things and they're getting some kind of pleasure out of it and then not doing it just to eat it right it's like even if you you are going to eat it we don't want you to be really happy when you kill something that's it to that some of it I think the villagers should it be able to ones that should vote on if it was okay or not it's in there Village

<timemark seconds="2559" />

they would vote okay every time because they get money from and then to me than that seems okay because a lot of times it's like we're judging things for so far away won't even know don't even know what it's like we're talking about completely different Dynamics in terms of like the way their culture works first of all the money for these big hunts of these people pay to shoot all these different things down there that's a shitload of money and that shitload of money for that area for that part of the world is gigantic fuels conservation efforts and pays for these people that are essentially their version of game wardens you know and then they have these different people that are employed by these hunting companies and then there's resources to stop poaching and then resources to actively participate in controlling habitat making sure these animals are in healthier populations and bringing their numbers off this is all done through the money that comes from hunting so the soup it's super

<timemark seconds="2617" />

fucked up right it's it's weird cuz it doesn't make sense it's like the people that are paying to keep these animals are also the ones that want to shoot them people at what the fun we would like it to be all the conservation money comes from people just love animals and want to keep them a lot but that's not the case. The case know the money comes almost let me sign exclusive way because there are a lot of conservation groups that do donate for wildlife protection and for preserving of animal habitats there are there's a there's definitely some people that donate right but this is not even close to the amount of money that's raised from hunting tag and it doesn't hunting you on that local level like you aren't you know like some of these like these programs I'm sure they're a little bit more bigger more blanket you know when you get in that local level $50,000 can keep you know a small town or out spell habitats around for the year

<timemark seconds="2677" />

it's but it still makes us uncomfortable but rightly so I mean you looking at a giraffe you want your apps to stay alive you say like that's amazing but we have to know that the facts behind it in this particular case were they that giraffe had to go yeah that drop is killing giraffes you're seeing fight it's the most amazing smash into each other it's what a terrible way to fight it's fucking crazy suck at fighting this off again like Crystal it sounds like Chris did Liam if you were in a fight, so they love you love is esophagus I love Chris and Liam at Target she wanted to hit something have you seen this Jaguar challenge Billy do you so surprised are you silly sometimes I don't really like he is he's so funny he's so fucking funny

<timemark seconds="2737" />

his own kind of cut his own kind of funny yeah and he lives yeah and he's so confident living in that space man it's kind of bomb yeah it's been it's interesting that you kind of gets illegal to know that guy that's what you know it is with you too it's like your kind of you you do your kind of funny and that's a that's an interesting thing like when someone finds there like we talked about Mitch Hedberg the other day like he had his kind of funny yeah but you can see it like you would hear a Mitch Hedberg joke can you go all that's it that's a Hedberg joke that's how he does his kind of funny yeah yeah it's so funny I will thanks for saying that man I appreciate that yeah I think it's like I've gotten a little bit older is made me feel more comfortable just be myself you know for so long out here I just felt if I was just afraid to be myself out of thing you know who I was you know it's all those things man you know it's hard trying to be trying to be confident when you what you're doing is a conference destroying way to make a living yeah like I would get intimidated easily I got this is the first time I've actually

<timemark seconds="2797" />

how can I look at more comfortable being in here yeah it's just some with me you know it's just something I don't know I don't know if it's like if I feel like if there's like men that I'm what I kind of physically you know in shape or so just so things may be inside of me some of that make me feel just so you know I don't know what it is it's people worry about being bullied for sure people develop by Gotye I feel it sometimes I'm around big people really I was thinking about that he hang us around some real rare animal humans you know yes superhuman that Daniel Cormier do that superhuman that big coffee man Mighty Mouse is a small superhuman George St-Pierre superhuman have your friend like an elevator with him or something

<timemark seconds="2857" />

talking to Francis ngannou did that's always in your mind no matter what you guys are talking about there's a part of you that says if you wanted to he could just kill me like that do you get scared that sometimes I honestly like I get scared for you whenever you have to go in the ring after the fights do you ever get scared a little bit dude the first time I ever interviewed anybody ever after a fight I had an interview Mark Coleman after he choked out dance ever and this was in like UFC fucking 12 so that was 1997 and Mark home and was so fired up Max you just won the heavyweight title fucking jacked he was so jacked and he was fucking pumped up and who is the king of the world back then Mark the hammer Coleman change the fucking game for the because she was like a real world class wrestler taken dudes down and just smashing them and he was

<timemark seconds="2917" />

fucking huge huge you know and so I'd interview and the first time I had her interview anybody for questions and then write an opportunity to express himself and then it worked out but I prepared for that man I was nervous wow we should this guy and you know this man is going into the cage after lunch that's what does how do I want you that's what I felt like me when you go out like it you know I'm not a very somebody's admit her very physically imposing to be like in that you know they're so when you some of them like man I can't believe that you go in there just Brave as you well know one thing that I think they all know and they don't know I wanted to know that I I don't

<timemark seconds="2968" />

want anything other than them to shine right that's all I'm trying to do like when I interview people but I'm trying to do is give them an opportunity to talk about moments I just want to give him a chance to shine Show who I want to feel comfortable I look out for the best interests I really do I try to do that with commentary even if it sounds critical my critical commentary sister expose like I look at it in terms of I'm looking at it like it's a math problem or a system and if I see things like this is this is an issue with this issue this is a real issue like a high-level prayers going to exploit that issue maybe this guy can't do it but sometimes he would get upset at that that does happen and I have to expose it and it made me think I exaggerate but believe me those fucking high-class killers and see the same shit that I see they're going to try to exaggerate that shit to that you going to try to jump on that little hole is a hole somewhere and that happens all the time people to get mad if you point out

<timemark seconds="3028" />

yeah I can't win this entire career they rarely throw a kick the never submit anybody and there's some of the best of all time do you don't have to have a fully complete Game sometimes it's better to just be ultra good at one or two things and those other things don't fuck with submissions you know just don't fuck with any of those are this they're just people that are like that they take some of the back they never show they just keep punching them they never choke anybody there's a lot of people like that and then there's cones almost raccoons do that on you never had a raccoon on me of you oh yeah they bite you bite you if I have one I've had maybe by then I got scratched or bitten I mean I had to get all the rabies shots and I grew up in like the rabies belt you know so you you. And a group of raccoons to do raccoons are they are I can't believe we can't shut all that shit down how many of maroon the streets at night alot Pro how crazy is it down

<timemark seconds="3088" />

hinder every where did I lived in I lived in New Rochelle New York and days to have these Urban raccoon different kind of raccoons raccoons live in high-density areas or Boulder species and they have access to massive amounts of food they just would lift off the lid from the garbage can lift off the lid they get inside the garbage can they tear the garbage bags over and they just be sitting there staring at you looking Jack look at Gold's Gym tonight up on like they were big I was like how is that raccoon that's where you are I shoot darts I did was wreck my garbage and you like shit overnight be sleeping and I'm climbing up do we have one of your cheek what is he doing he's going to get that bird feeder unscrew the bird feeder look how smart

<timemark seconds="3148" />

<timemark seconds="3198" />

if they had the kind of strength to do that how many people would even figure out how to navigate that so easily to Matt Iseman with American Ninja Warrior do you telling me that they don't steal some of these games from this is fucker

<timemark seconds="3211" />

look at him how come you stopped going full screen cuz you said you were flirting over and hang on there with one arm and then grabbing this beat is bananas what is that called in in UFC is that a move it doesn't just I guess maybe jumped the guard yeah I'm kind of jumping The Gardener amazing little body is just crazy to do that dude so much and they not working is this freezing I pause and they can eat newspaper how crazy is that all four limbs are you just chilling he's not worried that something's going to happen he's like let me to scoop my ass up here climb climb climb I'm just got Twisted fuck her off here looking he's hanging

<timemark seconds="3271" />

on with his legs and it just cracked it open this reverse look at this at the end of each two of his hands or two of his feet with their hands look at the size of their body can you imagine having a little bitty baby hand and having to do something I know right look how much smaller hand is in their face chewed up hands like a four-year-old girl opening the door but you can't even open the door you just have to stare at a door knob with a little phone talking the littlest hands the fuck you up to those thanks yeah raccoons eat a lot of chicken stew they like to get into chicken coops buck up chicken Z they would jump on your back is almost to hear the crazy thing I remember about being around raccoons it felt like they were playing with you but had an immediate propensity for violence against could go like very quick from fun and comfortable to extremely violent it makes sense to me what up Rough and Tumble world the world

<timemark seconds="3331" />

what is motherfuker ability tonight

<timemark seconds="3335" />

look at this summer Bambi no I think this is my grandmother had a friend that had a couple

<timemark seconds="3343" />

so he just knows how to open doors creepy fuck to some weird about them just strange animal that like almost seems like it shouldn't be real you know I got a smart weird animal that lives in the forest like you expected to start talking to a little kid that's on a walk yeah

<timemark seconds="3363" />

who are you where are you from and it's nice and it's little hand one dice just turned it over to show you a house that's made of candy on some lipstick and lip stick with each other creepy animals adapted to living right next to people let them do coyotes coyotes at them at your house anywhere around La in particular anywhere that there's some trees and shit in between the houses guess what you got coyotes they just fucking live everywhere man I saw all of them Burbank the other day driving up Olive I saw a fucking coyote sounds like whoa somebody reported a coyote fight in my neighborhood when I was growing up and it was somebody made that up but the cop still showed up and remember they interviewed everybody like we fucking knew anything about it dude 210 coyotes fight

<timemark seconds="3425" />

one if they do fight with each other I don't think I've ever heard of him fighting at this make sense someone has to be the boss

<timemark seconds="3432" />

the coyote World wolves do wolves fuck each other up do they really kill each other

<timemark seconds="3439" />

are you coyote fights here most intense coyote fight they're going to war right here on Worldstar I think it is Worldstar back right there coyotes

<timemark seconds="3452" />

strategically Hell by Bush do you think we could ever get to the point where you know that humans fight animals like they did back in the old days you know what gladiator-style seriously though for sure somebody from some crazy country where they had some maniacal Dicker dictator was on crystal meth they decided to have humans versus Lions give it to a sword and shield and some armor and him fuck up a lion hundred percent do you think that goes on

<timemark seconds="3487" />

I wouldn't say no yeah because I think there's people with enough money like fucking crazy crazy Prince money oh yeah there a prince of some crazy country

<timemark seconds="3500" />

people just probably can't get satisfied that it's not they can't get enough done at all these cocaine pussy and hold everything that's in France like what else do I want what else I want I want to watch a dude fight a lion with a sword yeah there's probably like some place that you can go right and it's got like drains in the floor with a hose it down from all the blood and it's like built like a hockey rink yeah but are the floor underneath the floor the zoo just like to have these to do in the Roman days and it rises up they let the animals out yeah close it down and then they did open the cage in the fucking dude stands there with the Sword and the Crowd Goes yeah and I'll listen to techno music and speaking Dutch and then that wasn't even aware they are in that fucking line go to war they go out at man

<timemark seconds="3557" />

you think he has like face paint on her anything or you just probably a good move pool face paint on you need every Edge yeah you probably going to get killed we going to cut the line and then get killed that's what you're going to do any good one good hit at it if you're lucky probably won't even really you don't have any idea how slow you are until you're around the cat the kills antelopes and shit chases after wildebeest take some out with his face you have no idea I think everybody shut off I think of the cat wants to the cats on you so fast you barely have time to move your arm that's what I think yeah I don't think you have any idea how fast like a real Predator moves out ridiculously soft human beings are right specially if you're not some I don't fucking Conan the Barbarian do to can actually swing a sword a heavy sword with was

<timemark seconds="3617" />

fucking umph behind it yeah your pick up a real sword and get it out of your shit man that's fucking heavy and it's sharp it's almost scary to have one sometimes you don't like fuck I would hurt myself ride to cut my cousin up or something on accident Route hurt somebody at the house yeah the odds of you killing that lion with one swipe or almost zero you're going to get fucked up okay how would you attack it then say you're in a place you got this sword maybe got one other weapon a small weapon you keep on your leg or something the only way that I think you have a chance is if you can keep your shit together and plunge that blade and its chest as it leaves on you

<timemark seconds="3655" />

is the only way you would have to be ready to as it comes out you to push forward and hold on to that sword with everything you have as it's coming at you in the blade goes into his body that might be the only way and even then it's going to swat you and rip you apart in Pacifica hold on to my time you're not going to be able to nope nope you don't think you could no no and you would keep both hands on now that's how you act it out and you keep both hands on it you are not going to be able to hang on you just not it's a different kind of power it took the power of many many men took the idea of a big bro do you think you can win a fucking tug-of-war with 10 do's and fuck yeah bro by chance there's there's a string level you have to be like some Herculean Marius pujanauski type dude so just ignore me fucking world Strongest Man guy with

<timemark seconds="3715" />

chocolove your hands and a good grip on the blade may be tied down like a rodeo rider plunging at the heart of a lion and even then I don't think you're hanging on to it I think that things going to block and chicken and you're going to be so terrified if it's a male lion you get a seat at Main and that face and your body are you going to get diminished yeah you going to be so overwhelmed with a drenalin your instincts going to be to just walk away from that thing as far as you can you feel like some truth as it like any truths like any innate truth will be revealed as you're as you're sitting there looking into those eyes and you know that it's going to kill you I don't think you're even there at that point I think you hear it I think you're it's such a primal experience that thing at that point you're probably that you're barely assuming you're just a series of synapses firing that are designed to protect you from predators I think you just in full Panic full address Erwin Rush full survival mode

<timemark seconds="3775" />

you don't you don't know what the fuck is going on I have some friends man I got some friends are attacked by a grizzly bear and they know everybody got away survived luckily but they were in there in an island off of Alaska fog neck Island and it's a huge population of brown bears and elk and they all live together these these fucking parents are huge and this bear which is like an 11-foot bear charge into their camp and knocked everyone over like guys were flying left and right one of the dudes is nicknamed Dartmouth Dartmouth was riding on the things back if you want to hear the whole story and it's a great story go to the meat eater podcast and I think the episodes just say afognak Island I don't know if it says bear attack in a fog neck Island but if you're if you're clever googlr you'll find it's a great pot

<timemark seconds="3835" />

ice anyway Steven I was a genius he's a really interesting guy and a hunter like we just told totally defies The Stereotype that people have played doofy Hunters of super well-read really interesting guy but his depiction of this event the most striking thing about it was that it defied everything he thought it would be like if there was an actual bear attack tell the canning way ask almost in a weird way we're right yeah because when you up if it's something really fucking crazy happens the best case scenario is there someone who actually knows how to write that's right there when there's something crazy happened right in this is the case but instead of writing it he just does a very eloquent job of describing as does everybody else there I mean there was quite a few guys there my friend Remi Warren was there and you could tell us

<timemark seconds="3884" />

is this is one where they got false attacked this isn't British Columbia they got false charged a false charge is a bear this in this case it was a bear with Cubs and she just want to scare them off so she can't running at them full clip it's crazy to see cuz they fired near her but they had the discipline to not fire at her why am I that is really impressive because this thing just came fucking running at them and it's huge like here it is

<timemark seconds="3917" />

give me some volume ear

<timemark seconds="3930" />

man Callahan says I'll never forget I want to give him a t-shirt with him and his mustache in this that's the Santa come to Callahan's mine this so that is what he had experience before and so he kind of kept his composure in that situation and use like this other one where the grizzly bear literally knock them over to the teeth were gnashing 10 inches from his face is just so many people the grizzly probably didn't expect there to be that many people there there's like 7 people there some like that one too at least 5 people there and I think that's what saved some of those camera people to surprise I was about 7 people and I think that's what saved on the fact that this was a giant mass of people in the bear didn't know which way to go and one of the dudes Rihanna's hit in the face with trekking poles it was tracking poll

<timemark seconds="3990" />

smack in the face and thing beard off one of the guys Remy he joked it he faked right and then went left on the pickup are there was just so much going on the bear just ran through it one of the guys wound up on the Bears back for like 10 yards there was running and he was somehow too stuck on the Bears back and then fell off this how big the bear was and I think when you see a bear menu don't think it's going to be like that that's all intents you know you don't think it cuz the first picture they should have that bear he said we could call him Berry in a look at that bear I've seen him in in the worst thing about bears is they advertise I mostly Disney movies how do you see a bear teddy bear you know what I'm saying you know they have fucking Bears fucking to on the internet you have all that kind of shit but it's like sweeties day your body here while how about those little kids that their dad got eaten in front of them. Those little kids what they had a little pet polar bear that's not outside the realm of possibility with little kids and you get convinced that that's what those Adam

<timemark seconds="4050" />

I'm not saying should have a pet stuffed polar bear they're cute

<timemark seconds="4055" />

SoundCloud and I'm saying a toy would you have a little Barry thing as a pet don't fucking way man really is ridiculous you seem like I got it might have a little bit of that dude not listening to you yet get away with all that they might be your friend can might be your friend as they grow older but you better keep that food around bitch and even if you have that people rob you can't keep him from killing other people like there was a guy who has bear trained look at the size of that fucker oh my God this one is definitely probably oh my God this is a gay man to keep this animal fed there are people that have Bears is this in Russia is Russia yeah so if there's people that keep Bears fed and take care of them and treat them well you know and there's something about bears to is at Burr bears are omnivores that eat everything I really hate animals and vegetables they ate everything

<timemark seconds="4115" />

so they don't have to eat they don't have to kill things didn't necessarily have the desire to chase things down a kill things like a cat done like cats have it a deep desire to kill things right by cats can't shake that shit out I think you could you could feed a bear well and take care of it and you can probably avoid most of that but if it ever feels threatened in any way you're so fucked and you think you have any like it there you might not even notice when that bear feels that way I wouldn't I'm not a bear expert I think a real bear extra would see the something's weird bears acting sketchy singers are bears like they start acting irritated me the size of these things man this guy is definitely a pervert you think so yeah because I think there's got to be something inside of you that gets off in a weird way to do this I don't think this feels natural I think they're Intoxicated by powerful animals and not having these powerful animals around gives them a thrill okay the thrill has to be do you think that that

<timemark seconds="4175" />

that they could kill him that's it 100% And also did like the thrill is they are beautiful creatures so you do want to be around them like either cool is be around and right you can make friends with this beautiful creature That Could Just Kill a mess of people it kind of feels fun dangerous yeah it's cool celebrities like John or some way better mother fucker I got a 12 foot dog was my house you don't like but cats see that's it scares me you know these people these are different animals this is a different thing but I think if people have an animal like that they're fucking next to it at night and they're doing I think it's some of that shouldn't you should be probably near it I don't think they're getting involved with it but I think they're doing near it also Park right next to the tiger and get him horny what do bestiality needs and I thought this about beastiality and even talk about this week but if you have sex with a local animal son that lives here

<timemark seconds="4235" />

livestock chickens so it's fucked up shit fucked up and it's not you know what you know it isn't right. You know the rules are different account on who you ask Bobby locally welcome mountain lion got some strong man that's how I get it you don't do you never buy a beer again you fucking Mountain you fuck a lynx that to me that's not bestiality to me that's like some Ragnar Lothbrok type shit yeah that's the bravest thing you can do this is Viking ship imagine trying to keep an erection and then sneak up on a pocket animals but you think there's ever got the best of the mountain lion and fucked it

<timemark seconds="4287" />

T I will not

<timemark seconds="4291" />

<timemark seconds="4401" />

who is o'clock and I getting in Alaska on books about homeless people in serve lunch but I remember going in there and the only sex you could see it the time was like Road in or something I get out of these old artist normally would pay like a rubenesque mean by shearing that you would like this yeah she breast to get one of her hand like this but I remember like a pose dicative of a certain time and history really hard to draw a hand o that could be it maybe somebody drew one but if you you think that like Emperor's would stand there and do this to their to their people like you know how great look just two things that Trump could do that people would freak the fuck out one of them obviously is like a sieg heil

<timemark seconds="4461" />

just as bad as an emperor he comes up with one hand almost like he's holding invisible football and the other hand do this and just address to people people blow a gasket give out to be the emperor you want to be my god did he should start wearing a crown how great would it be be started wearing a crown it would be hilarious we start wearing like a cheap Burger King 1 East didn't say nothing about it he has a sense of humor he definitely does the first president that is ever been roasted on Comedy Central that's a great Point dude you got roasted on Comedy Central and Jeff Ross even said to him like you like yeah laughing at the joke so she probably laugh at them I don't know it's probably people like it better if you you're going along with his yeah you're right and then he loosened up so I can laugh at so you think takes advice from people right that are in the business so I think they told some ruthless jokes

<timemark seconds="4521" />

not here man hung in there and Mary handled it I think he's resilient whether or not he can feel any of that like cuz of his like whatever ego spaces and I wonder how much that eat it feels but I'm only only human in America that could take this much hatred from people at such like a level head and it doesn't even care it's kind of awesome it's kind of why I remember after he got elected driving down the street me like holy shit dude I could be president some about his and when I say awesome I don't mean good I mean amazing about his abilities like all throughout all this crazy shit he doesn't show any signs of being

<timemark seconds="4568" />

like it doesn't seem to be like freaked out right over the Stormy Daniels shed or over the Russian all the investigations occasionally goes on a mad tweetstorm yeah he's the same guy but he was before he doesn't seem to be there certain dudes when you see something like a good example something fucked-up happens to them and you see it in their face rice like they're like well like George Bush whenever maybe on that video and then I know whenever they see the pictures and they told him about Knoxville 9/11 was huge thing that's different you how huge it was a time it was all breaking out in Aldie that was on here at example yeah but yeah that seems totally unaffected

<timemark seconds="4612" />

John Gray's ain't nobody scared of citizens on Twitter that that's the thing senior citizens on Twitter's kind of bizarre does a lot of them every couple minutes of doing Facebook all day yelling at people on Facebook great dude everybody hates it got says I don't think everybody's I think a lot of people like the time we're right now cuz it's so it's just I feel like you know what you're going to get you no no it's it's a strange time for communication that really is yeah strange time for everything yeah man it's it's different it's so different that it's fucking it kind of fastening I had dumb they got Jordan Peterson came out podcast the other day cuz I know his publicist and I reached out and the publicist some and then it was wild and so then he came through cuz it mean a lot of the people listen to my podcast her

<timemark seconds="4666" />

you know we talked a lot about like being sober in the people that masturbate too much kind of weird stuff you know Grant troubled youth kind of I'll say it but anyway it was cool because he like I don't know you know him better than I do he loves you he said a lot of nice things about you I didn't think that at all it's not by any stretch of the imagination you just said certain things that people are uncomfortable hearing and whether you agree with them or disagree with them that's one thing but that's the demonization is work it's weird even if you think he's what is ideas foolish don't misrepresent who he is as a person be racist homophobic is fucking alright character he's not by any stretch of the imagination he's just a guy that especially when his principles are being debated or when his ideas are being tested like he'll stand his ground and he's very firm about what he thinks is

<timemark seconds="4726" />

wrong about things like equality of outcome but making sure that everybody makes the same amount of money make sure everybody achieve the same amount of success like that is a ridiculous idea that leads to Communism and Marxism he gets into it and it made me rethink how I thought about it before that I thought about it before then like an unattainable goal that socialist lean towards because it's like the ideal the idea was that money is not a concern for anybody and everybody just started does whatever they want to do because they enjoy doing it not because they're doing it for money in that all the money is kind of piled in together we take care of everybody sounds great on paper right but then he starts talking about no you have to enforce equality of outcome right thing goes when you were talking about it cuz there's too many people that work harder right. Evil to try harder than Cindy different varying levels of effort because we're human beings you have to take that into consideration these people don't take that into consideration and sit then you're you're you're either trying to stop the people that are doing too well or you're trying to take from them to give to yourself and how you in for

<timemark seconds="4786" />

miss me she just takes you down this Rabbit Hole thought and really kind of explains the problems with Marxism and socialism in intelligent people to dispute his ideas I'm not saying that his ideas are infallible and he's the only voice that I would listen to any subject but he's a brilliant guy and he's a very nice guy too and he's really missing misrepresented and in willfully so a lot I think it's sad because it's missing between ride in the left is how much bit we we would probably agree on and we just talk about things rationally instead of contentiously instead of getting any of these right versus left the base what you just way too common where everybody's on one side is trying to diminish the person inside an in and get angry and they're doing a lot of these in front of big crowds which I think is also weird because then you're playing to the crowd I've seen some things that Jordon did with his Michael Eric Dyson guy with a guy really wasn't looking at him is looking at the crowd calling him a mean mad white man and it's like

<timemark seconds="4846" />

things that people are doing it just everyone just digging her heels in deeper on each side and instead of like looking at life like just having an open conversation about things that are troubling things where we could do bad things were Society needs work with things maybe where are perceptions are off maybe we could look at the other side look at each other a look at the whole thing better and figure out a better way around things instead of doing that everybody is Right versus left and right and deeper in the trenches and harder and we got to stop chop and I hope we have a recession to stop Trump and people saying crazy shit crazy like everybody supposed to suffer so that you can make one guy feel like he's doing a bad job or it's just not the way to approach it like you seen that what is that woman's name Maxine what does the name Maximilian said Trump Trump's Ohio broke people's meals and draw crowd and like you know and it I guess it's in response to what is the most

<timemark seconds="4906" />

starving policy was a separate children from their parents and people crossing the border but I think he didn't decide to put a stop to that then they decide to put a stop to that do you sign something to put a stop that what's that plays scary for doing that to a border I don't know I read that it didn't do that and how do you separate people from the kids you got to be you got to be trying to send some fucked-up message to scare the shit out of them so they will keep them from coming over the right idea I guess if you tell him you going to take the kids away they probably won't even try and then but what about this say it's like you know everybody's against like sex trafficking and I'm not like what if one of those people is that scenario and the kids too afraid to say it I know that's like a maybe more in a cute situation but in that case you'll be grateful that you separated at least to get each other's point of view to know kind of what's a little bit more what's going on with huge issue like

<timemark seconds="4965" />

sex trafficking that you know everybody just bringing young women in here to you know from other places for sex and I don't see that much of it but apparently it's the biggest thing in the world you know it was last month it was something that was I don't know if this is true either I'm giving Jamie a lot of work today there was a smart the right sex trafficking ring that was broken up by ice and outside of it these people were protesting ice because of what I there were like saying abolish ice for me while ice was like Steppy didn't understand that when you're doing it what is it image immigrations Customs Enforcement that would I stand for what they're doing is not just the not just trying to stop people from crossing over the Border there also busting in this case apparently it was a sex trafficking ring or human trafficking ring I don't know if they were using was slaves or they're using

<timemark seconds="5025" />

sex slave that's it thanks see if two truckloads of people coming to America right and one is is you know what don't send children and another is adults and children right and one of them are just actual family members and one of them are sex you know adults you know main man trying to bring in sex workers we. I mean how do you know how do you not say you know like I know yet you don't to take a mother from a kid or a father from a daughter but it's like how do you know what if we and what if you I don't know it's at the job that is a problem with people coming in if they're coming in a legal you have no idea who they are what they doing yeah that's only one problem the other problem is people were criminals people who are violent offenders you know people just people that have gone back and forth multiple times I got busted in American want to killing people yapping many times

<timemark seconds="5078" />

yeah that that guy in San Francisco remember that I said only shot the cop shooting the girl but yeah minutes I'm glad I mean as much as it's hectic so not to think about it in here about it I think it's also it's neat to be alive at a time when you know I'm challenged to think you know what I'm challenged to to to feel different ways and hear different voices in opinions about it honestly like I feel like we should have more of a roll call in America like you have to know who's here before you can even you know you're teaching a class from you don't know who's in the class how can you even you know but it's what they should do first and foremost is legalize drugs and the reason being is that they're getting across from organized crime and its building organized crime in Mexico to a staggering degree the drugs are here people are selling these drugs. They're going to keep selling these drugs you're not going to diminish the amount of drugs

<timemark seconds="5132" />

you just not no one's ever been able to do it the drug Wars the complete total failure of coke so make Coke legal you would put a fucking halt to so much and if you made Coke legal people die pure Coke you would it would it be tested and you could give people drug education cuz you like everybody knows okay how many beers can you drink if you drink 3 beers you probably shouldn't drive a car unless you're a giant you know like three beers you're probably over the legal limit Usher of there right let's do some seven-foot-tall Carrillo type man just out got a lot of by but an irregular feel like you are a regular guy you should not drive right so now stop and think

<timemark seconds="5177" />

like what is the level for cocaine I don't know I don't do it I've never done it but I don't know what it is like maybe we should know but you know you can't have three shots of Jack Daniels and drive okay but what what about what about speed I'm just going to take the coke you should not be talking to people yeah buddy try to put all of his fingers in his butt one time if you'd like an 8-ball of coke how crazy is that it's a good goal to have it called something it was like all of the Liberty Bell or something some crazy thing but in your butt I think that's call go for hunting how would you do that on your back with your legs Bugs Bunny Style over your head you have to hook your leg and then go home and

<timemark seconds="5237" />

flexible pull it off and you get it the crazy part is I'm just I'm thought about this a lot but I thought about this for a little bit you going to start with your smallest fingers and then you going to be stuck with those thumb that's a given triangle hard part is going to rip your ass whole part well that's the risk you take like an old balloon and that's you know if there's no forwarding it to you from us have slender fingers when he was farming look duties on that much cocaine did I'll do anything you know I said that's the thing dude I got all fucked up and it be nice to get cocaine and do it by myself at home you know just to

<timemark seconds="5275" />

and I wasn't doing that good just have some feelings and I remember dude I would order vests and shit off the internet I have a good what kind of vest LOL kind of like the kind that we would wear if you lived in Boulder with a down-filled ones Patagonia time I've gone that's a weird shirt with a puffy vest I want to be warm but I want a little bit of ventilation in my arms I just a little chill I just walked around my body though I like my torso to be warm

<timemark seconds="5307" />

I'm talking all kinds bro I will get the leather I will get the ones at The Bijou I mean I have like a honestly I probably about 30 best at-home why best why was at the thing you would order on cocaine it was just something I like to do mad at that light up different colors and shit like yeah I'm going out with one of my buddies had a nice yeah that guy's gay by 100% gay about you be careful backing off in Old English letters throw I love pussy so much I had my asshole turned into a pussy

<timemark seconds="5367" />

hey bro do you stem cells bro I guess a new stem cells do I got these new stem cells use on my asshole but but but they got Jordan Peterson the super cool man what did you guys talk about you know I'd you listen to any of us. Before you have them on I listen to your episode with a master's in the day before and I listen to and I've been listening to his book so that's where I was and I listen to the Munk debate and this just he just seemed like the pure you seem completely pure and whatever you know he believed I think that in helping people like cuz I talk to about getting start to feel like famous you know like because people are really gravitating towards and he just felt it genuinely seemed that he felt this good for people he wants he was happy to be helping others

<timemark seconds="5427" />

and that like it didn't seem Academy ego in it. He definitely does like to help people but it also feels a responsibility because of his knowledge to explain what he thinks is a problem certain types of behavior certain laws and one of them that got him in trouble or got him controversial got a lot of controversy attached to it was the compelled speech laws for transgender people that use of compelled pronouns mean if you decided that you weren't going to be he or a she you can make up a number of different names and they would be legally compelled to use those names and some people arguing that's not what it says and then he would say no it's a it's a human rights violation if you don't follow along with that like this is this is compelled speech in this is dangerous this is why this what it leads to and then there's always people debating with him but then when you got a chance to see is with him debating these points with these various intellectuals including like gender studies teachers and shit you got to see

<timemark seconds="5487" />

oh this this is a crazy idea like these these people that think that you should have like 78 different gender pronouns and then it says it's tantamount to violence to not use someone's preferred pronoun you like oh oh you're crazy right now this is a mad person wants the world to be different so you want all these new laws attached to whether or not someone calls him and he or she and they're getting some traction with it what is where is weird in New York New York City I think it's the landlords and it might be in pores am I but I think I'm pretty sure it's landlord they are compelled to use your preferred pronouns so if your landlord decides to call you a different thing like if you say I machine now and is a fuck you see I knew you when you were Theo your feel see what that lies compelled gender pronouns law New York City but people like wait a minute wait a minute how many do I have to know right which ones do I have to agree

<timemark seconds="5547" />

you start cuz there's a ton of glitter is 78 different gender pronouns you know what I'm fine like I know they would you know for a while it was like people in certain areas they don't want to build transgender bathroom just like 9 people in this town and we've seen everybody's dick like nobody we don't have any you can't change all the zoning laws for Pete for when there's not even someone present in some of these areas I think in some bad ways they're making people not be accepting of transgender people that they may meet at some point by creating all of this this this this rhetoric or whatever it is this this conversation it's like some people already fed up and they've never even met someone like this and so then they're going to have weird they're going to have already like contentious views when they do meet someone just cuz I've heard too much background noise that it's problematic you know when it's not that's certainly possible it's also possible that people will be scared of the

<timemark seconds="5607" />

backlash so they won't use trance phobic language anymore the problem with that is your not encouraging empathy your encouraging fear your encouraging fear of not following the the standard line of behavior and speech and that's where people have a problem with it it's like the real way to do it is to promote empathy to say like look these people like this guy's born in the wrong body came through the surgery let him use the woman's room yeah why not and if they're bad person judge that bad person on each individual basis now what you talkin about children that's what people scared of that you know you're going to have some creep who pretends he's a woman so he can get in the girls room and he's going to molest children but worst-case scenarios yeah those are terrible worst case scenario but what how often is that going to happen how do we protect that how we prevent that from happening at those the question but what the for the vast majority of the people that become true

<timemark seconds="5667" />

do you really think they're going to molest people I don't think they are you can't judge the vast majority base on a few that's just like the same logic that says people shoot up people with guns so we should take everyone's guns away that's crazy to know the vast majority people guns don't shoot people the vast majority people are trans they don't hurt anybody than that that's all they try to do it just get along and be who they are this is a complex subject dangerous when people are scared that they're scared or bullied into agreeing with one side of the other side because then then shit gets weird because I'm becomes a battle but becomes a battle instead of opportunity to enforce and encourage compassion but that it can be done both ways yeah I think the Opera but to look at these people like look he just hook why do you care if someone wants to be a girl why do you care if she wants to be a guy why do you care

<timemark seconds="5727" />

just like let it do tattoo his face let let what do whatever you want man as long as you're not fucking people over and you're not hurting people you know they're robbing people and stealing from people and murdering people as long as that's not happening yeah do whatever you want. Should be our approach this stuff that's in one of our Lives to be someone the Bill of Rights or somewhere I knew I knew a new Amendment be something in there where we think about the web why why we have a problem and how we address the problem soon as your dress a problem with force force Ford is forcing return you going to get Force back people going to get it going to want to get wrapped up just as much to attack you is you attacked them and then you going back and forth left and right it becomes fucking chaos yeah that's what we have right now on Fox News and CNN the right and the left and everybody digs are heels in fat and fuck it's it's not it's not helpful and is also a bunch of people to profit off of this this battle Yeah okay no New York City did not just introduced

<timemark seconds="5787" />

$250,000 fine for any incorrect use of gender pronoun but they did for some use of gender pronouns I think that question there was a a blog post I got rid of the New York Post reported on it it was an updated or a change in the guidelines but it's not supposed to be free like an incorrect or Miss misuse of it what is it supposed to be for harassment and discrimination okay so we're garliss of individual sex assigned at Birth Anatomy gender medical history of parents with the sex indicated on the individual's identification okay the Rob requires employers and covered entities to use an individual preferred name pronoun and title EG miss or Mrs regardless of the individual sex assigned at Birth so that's okay these guidelines as noted by the commission can impose penalties of up to $250,000 for violations that are the result of willful want

<timemark seconds="5847" />

in or malicious conduct so that seems like they're saying that it is true

<timemark seconds="5853" />

there aren't that is too so there is a law but there's a commission not just like you can't just say it and it was someone's going to find you yet has to go through a long lengthy court process they're not just finding people write business isn't exactly skinny slippery imagine the all this is going to do is create a tunnel lawsuits because it's a commission like that might even be worse that you're bringing it into like you have to sit in front of a bunch of experts about to decide whether or not you you have miss gendered someone or you know where is APA like a crazy just look if someone's an asshole there an asshole like what if what if you're a Jew and someone calls you a kite can they get fined $250,000 how does that work and then know right but that's a defensive term for Jewish person so if you if you brought that to court how would that work I don't think you'd get

<timemark seconds="5913" />

miss being brought they're not like just a person over there like landlords is one of them that they brought up like you know if you decided that you were BJ me still but now you're Jamie the woman I'm like the fuck out of here Jamie your dude give me my money and I want an apartment that you are offering and you wouldn't give me the apartment for that reason or we work together in some sort of way and I'm discriminating against you at work Miami teaches to Philly so many it just seems like a grandpa so many lawsuits what I find is if somebody is a dick to somebody if somebody calling somebody a name or something these days with so many camera phone did so many things usually it gets brought out pretty quick if somebody's racist these days like really devout like in their core in and they like it gets brought out pretty fucking quick you're not always though not always I'm sure some people get away with it we need a Healer now you know how I like in an area group and not to be racist you hear somebody say something to somebody else did they say

<timemark seconds="5973" />

say and they got their ass whooped and then they learn not today I mean it was a weird way to learn it but you learned you learned it would be nice if people could learn another way to realize how stupid it is to just be racist should judge individuals like based on their actions what they've done how they treat other people how you know whether or not they're doing things that are illegal or immoral write an ethical that's as an individual but as soon as you're doing it based on where they can't control right there what they're what they look like where they were born what part of the world are from that's just fucking stupid you're judging people on something of zero control over yeah that's crazy and they're still doing that that are still living in that space than its I mean it is something that I think someone will just take more time but I think eventually something will be eradicated it at I think it's based Powers my thing

<timemark seconds="6033" />

quality bass bro don't seem worth Regional a hit regeneration from all being beige dude so you don't want no no not because of places like England and Scotland and Ireland were toys rainy you can just going to get a massive amount of white people in those spots no matter what it's just no son you see saves from England that's what it is really about a lot of stuff I'm in overtime overtime they just turned into white people just like every other person that move to England yeah right every fucking human being came out of Africa a hundred percent yeah that's the origin of the species we came from Africa branched out into the world and we got to places like Scotland were never fucking sniffer Sunny we got bleached out people got they turned into like solar panels for

<timemark seconds="6093" />

vitamin D I just tried soak up that vitamin D yeah cuz if you're black you like you have so much melanin if you like Kong go black you got a dark skin color that's just awesome for son but it's terrible when there's no sun like how you getting your vitamin D do you even if you hug a black person that's like your skin feels a little bit kind of like more moist you don't I'm saying kind of these cocoa butter how do we have to do in our neighborhood his brother set him on fire and his whole leg was a she does do boo boo Tyson and he

<timemark seconds="6126" />

Steven going to Ashley Osborne oh yeah she's just a little bit African like in my course in as I lay in bed at night and just like pretend I was in Africa blood tested to see what you are I didn't look at the results yet scared little bit Yeah I think you got 13% I don't laugh about that Jamie how come you don't want to be French of all things what's wrong with that why would I bother you in a little bit they made great wine great painters who cried make rewind the French people just like to fuck and they think that the way we handle things stupid they have affairs like openly publicly like that like me a little bit of course they cheat there all fucking animals over there it is

<timemark seconds="6186" />

that Toxoplasma apparently was running rampant through France really what is it from cats get it and they get it from rats and it's a it's a parasite that gets into human brains and it affects humans and it makes people little bit more Reckless I like rabies kind of a light no not rabies more like like slightly drunk all the time yeah and this Toxoplasma apparently there was one point I'm 40% above range of France was infected with Toxoplasma yes that's true. Fuc fast I bet fuckfest wild and loose yeah you got any relation between the high levels of infestation and the behavioral changes the population in Penn Station what rats or if you live in a farm

<timemark seconds="6246" />

you step on a field and gets in your skin like maybe cats have been shitting all over the place or a dog will eat something that the you know some cat shit shit shit you're feeling the dog 2012 from France where an estimated 43% of the people carrying toxoplasmosis Gondii concluded that men with a latent infection tend to be more dogmatic less confident more jealous less impulsive and more orderly them out infected man infected women seem warmer more conscientious more persistent more insecure and more sanctimonious whoa get it I'll get a six pack for the ladies then huh that sounds crazy is that 43% of people carry it Jesus Christ that's a large number of human beings infected by something that changes Behavior or at least leads to trends that are different in the end noticeable more dogmatic less, less confidence interest

<timemark seconds="6306" />

Gondii associations of having antibodies to the parasite with bipolar disease suicidal Behavior even optimistic disposition possibly related to the parasites effect on dopamine

<timemark seconds="6323" />

so he gets in your body and then you just have it for life wow yeah it is sexually transmitted must be then that's a very good question I don't know if 42% of people have it I can't imagine that half of the population is Steph you know a fucking well they think they that's a good that's a good question but I think there's a lot of feral cats around yeah that's true that's running around Ratatouille that whole movie about that animal that was a shadow and what it does to the rats is it makes them get hard-ons when they smell cat piss is that really rewires or sexual rewards system testes enlarge when they smell cat piss no way to go

<timemark seconds="6374" />

43% a high number methyl that's like

<timemark seconds="6379" />

a lot of people was 43 out of 100 people on the planet 2 billion people have it is 43% of those tested in that study been tested you been tested know how have you been texting each other that's a rough estimate man they don't fucking know I bet it's a lot higher I bet is a lot of people that have it yeah shit in the blood dude I probably got it we had a dr. Robert sapolsky in the podcast we did one with him he's an expert in it and he's got a bunch of lectures and speeches on it and he said that when he was a resident that he had heard about a guy who found out that a disproportionate number of motorcycle accidents are attributed to people that were on this Toxoplasma really yeah the day that they they got this infection and it was causing them to do stupid shit on motorcycles and crash I would hate that man enough to ride a motorcycle and then have it like you know just to be being led astray by rare disease in your brain

<timemark seconds="6439" />

I want and I wonder if it varies right I want of the Toxoplasma that they get in Paris has the same exact response as the one that they get in South America no America develop its a bunch of variation yeah I'm talking about there's different ones a long island has a lot of it says Chrysler different ones

<timemark seconds="6459" />

foxy about the what is this though this seem like what is it was parasites okay so we have parasites parasites exist in so many animals that hitch rides and then that they've got their ecosystem are ecosystems to be on planet Earth their ecosystem is to be in Planet Theo Von and they just get inside of you have parasites ever change like the kind of the course of history that would happen with the plague or is that a different thing now the plagues a different thing but they probably could change the course of history if they really change that many people's behavior if you think about Paris there are France they're talking about 43% of the people have this infection the irony of parasites how crazy is that

<timemark seconds="6500" />

it's a parasite what if they have could you imagine little French fucking Uber a stupid American the craziest one man is a aquatic worm it climbs inside a grasshoppers body grows in the Grasshoppers body and then it tells the grasshopper commit suicide on my God guess the grasshopper to jump in the water and it wants a grasshopper gets in the water then it bursts out of its body I'll take Pinocchio meets alien if you say movie Alien with Sigourney Weaver

<timemark seconds="6537" />

<timemark seconds="6832" />

in divorce is you already brush your teeth that's the crazy part 2 to happen cuz you don't know it first I was staying at are super old hotel like really old from the 1800s they like redid it downtown. Dre I didn't tell people Where I Stood so because I didn't want to be mean to the hotel the Padre Hotel I think it says Tupac is old play yes I think that's a nice later yeah yeah but it's just they got some old-ass pipes clean those pipes on something's going wrong in there I was staying there so what are you died what if I was just shitting all over myself the rest of the day now to cancel my shows how about that

<timemark seconds="6892" />

are not I'm not trying to make you think about it I'm pretty sure that's how the world that's how the road goes now you're born and then you die but what do you think I don't know man. Yeah I think he's just drunk yeah I have to be at to decide if you going to die or no I mean I have two bases on what we know about people now I know the people used to be alive and now they're not so what happened to them are they faking it you know but you will you be sad if you died I think I think I'll be dead bro

<timemark seconds="6934" />

yeah what about you I'll be sad if you died I don't think you I'd be sad if you died too thanks man I would be worried about the end of your life

<timemark seconds="6944" />

yeah it we are worried about in the sense it makes me really wonder than what what is my time mean what does your tongue mean but what's important to in this life right now

<timemark seconds="6955" />

I think probably be in just feeling we're okay with myself probably and trying to have maybe help other people being more okay with yourself like what what bothers you about yourself I just wish I just felt more comfortable in my own skin a lot of times you know cuz I feel like I would be able to be more effective as a person if I could just that kind of ghetto not Toil and some of my own you know it's small self-worth issues or work like lack of confidence at times you know I wish I could trust my instincts and I wish my instincts were like better calibrated so that I knew when I was with if I was doing like okay and good stuff than my inside like told me you're you're being okay you don't have to worry you know there's a lot of things going on there right one of them the big one is almost always from your childhood

<timemark seconds="7004" />

almost feelings of lack of worth and self-worth come from that feeling as you're developing as you're growing up yeah feel like you're not loved or not appreciated or your criticize too much you feel like you're a loser and really be can psychic psychologically we very hard to shake and even as people get older sometimes they still they still cling to this thought that there are there a piece of shit because they were piece of shit in someone's eyes when they were 8 or 10 that's one of the reasons why when someone gets bullied when they're young it can be so devastating because it's happening when your in high school or Junior High School and it becomes a defining moment for you yeah yeah it's daddy I'm scared this one kid really are so bad this one kid one of these are going to the wrestling this kid like we had this confrontation in a locker room and I

<timemark seconds="7064" />

I think we're going to fight like I was just totally bluffing I don't know what what I said or what he said I don't remember but I do remember him getting me in a headlock throwing me on the ground and then leaning like he was going to punch me in the face but deciding not to and I didn't know what to do I had no no martial arts skills no nothing right I have I've never wrestled anybody before I didn't know anything so there's nothing in you that is like every Act of panicked but no idea what to do and I think. Shit I didn't think he was going to do that and now here I am on my back I'm trapped but God damn it I got a Russell I gotta learn to martial arts or something tonight start taking karate and then I start taking wrestling like right after that but that I avoided that kid every time I saw him while I see you on the other side of school would like to see you through the Breezeway and always knew where he was I want to see that guy that threw me on the ground and could have punched me in the face was almost like more humiliating that he did could have punch me in the face but didn't

<timemark seconds="7124" />

but that bullying and that guy doing that to me that fear of like being just helpless made me get in the martial arts rise like a fuck this like I got to figure out how to fight I don't want this to happen to me anymore cuz if you see that the benefit benefit situation to like you didn't beat me up it could have been way worse it was not that big a deal with the easy school to go do like my school wasn't hard even though there was some criminals that were in that school like some kids get shipped into it was some bad kids and one of them got charged with murder like right after graduating with my friend Kevin we knew this dude and killed somebody more like whoa yeah I think he was 1 year older than me. Somebody like right after high school yeah that should we news on the football team or group be like new one and then everything he would murder somebody

<timemark seconds="7178" />

the tough-guy scary guy for Shirley the PowerHouse of a person like a tank I didn't know him well though but I do not say hi to him but it's one of those things where when something like that happens to you in for me again it was a very minor yeah I was just scared of this guy and he didn't do anything to me horrible just threw me on the ground so when I saw my face and I would have been able to shit are you grateful and we're way that he didn't or not great, but looking back on it for sure it was enough he just let me know I was you know I don't know what I said I meant to said something stupid he might have said something stupid and wanted me to back down and I didn't say just grab me threw me on the ground but the fact that he that he did it and could do it led me to make one of the biggest decisions on my whole life is getting involved in martial arts didn't want that feeling anymore like if someone talked like gives me a hard time I want to be the one who can decide whether or not this gets violent or who

<timemark seconds="7238" />

I don't want to leave that in some stranger's hands might be a fucking psychopath yeah it's in my hands no one's getting hurt we're going to be finally does a video of Matt Serra from yesterday Matt Serra there was a drunken altercation with some fucking dude in the food court Matt Serra who is a Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt like what who at one point time when he was competing is when the best Brazilian jiu-jitsu artist in the world then on top of that if Aunt and the Mets knocked out George St-Pierre won the Welterweight Title and he's got some dude on the ground and he's just saying calm down calm down because I'm going to fuck you up where the fuck but it's hilarious to watch like this look at it and play the volume

<timemark seconds="7279" />

is it going to break your fucking face

<timemark seconds="7283" />

what is holding his wrist I love how he has a shirt on the guy's face he's like come down come down it's like he's putting a crying baby to sleep and so the security guard comes over to his let him go he goes okay you going to control them are you going to control them is going to control them

<timemark seconds="7307" />

are you ready to control him like he's not he's standing up and he's fat

<timemark seconds="7320" />

let me tell you something I'm at Sarah's one of the nicest fucking guys on the planet Earth if he has to do this to you in a restaurant she's a restaurant he's got full mount on you you thought you fucked up dude I see your way way better off with Matt Serra in that position then that drunk dude on some guy who doesn't know how to fight like to be that to the drug do to just be a real mean violent person want to beat someone up if he gets down so if there's guys like you know who aren't into that kind of so you found getting in the martial arts are really kind of LED you in like a away where you felt more confident in case things got a new uncomfortable situation that you would be okay yeah we'll look you're always you're always going to be nervous in life when something's important whether it's going on stage or something difficult about you know difficult things make you nervous like there is an anticipation is an understanding of the difficulty of something you're about to pursue and whether or not you're going to fall short when are you going to succeed and that shit makes people nervous but the physical confrontation nervousness

<timemark seconds="7380" />

a bad one that's it that's all like that is a paralyzing fear yeah oh yeah you feel being hurt you can't do anything about that devastates deep deep depression so it's really important I think I think every young man should learn how to fight I think they would be way less fights because of it and I don't think you have to be a mean person to learn martial arts I think it's a skill and I think you learn it and then once you start getting good at it it start actually so it's actually becoming fun and the people you practice it with you you become close with yeah you don't you don't hate the people that you're practicing fighting with they become some of your closest friends yeah and I think it's a just a big it's a giant confidence boost to know that you can do something difficult and get better at it that's I think just that alone it has massive benefits for people yeah you know I can sense that mean I were watching a video couple years ago actually view like getting a belt or something they gave you a has some Dojo or not sure what the correct

<timemark seconds="7440" />

Knology was watching when I got my black belt why you do it you're a strapping man you talk to Eddie I thought your mom about going to do it one day so he said he said yeah you know give me in like one of the beginners classes I think I need to do it but yeah you make me feel a bit more like you said sometimes I just I don't know if people get bullied and then they don't have like a brother or they don't have a friend or they even have somebody to go like talk to me like all man and their buddy Blackhearts okay you know like that see that's back inmate you know then that person gets stuck inside themselves just feeling like you know like they're not going to be okay you know now it's everywhere you go you're you're just scared of running into this guy yeah very very bad you know I took a test to get into it

<timemark seconds="7500" />

animal inclination to pick on the week you know only humans realize it and stop it and actually tell people not to do it and understand the effect it has on the people that do it every animal does it dogs do a chicken's do it chickens have a pecking order they fuck with one chicken and then they all decide all the talk with this bitch and they all attacker for no reason it's weird man you seen it every dogs do it one dog will pull up and the other dog go dog Oak hour and then they decide the pecking order I mean and then that's all I will always go near that dog and fuck with him and growl at them maybe bite his ear or something like that and yeah it's a weird thing that animals figured out how to make sure that the only ones that get to breed are the ones that are confident and powerful and can overcome problems okay and one of the problems is other mating viable males that want to meet with the women that you want to meet with like with this fucking giraffe they want to kill in those three other giraffes this guy

<timemark seconds="7560" />

I just was like fuck these bitches coming up I'm going to scratch my head of these draft stop them you ain't fucking these girls when you get older fuck you bitch and this is just a natural inclination that animals have to find the week in force it out and we don't have it well we do we did have it more silly we have a blast now I say we realize because of communication right we realize that this devastating effects and then we have a loving and caring communities we have compassion that you shouldn't do that right there's an inclination that people have to pick on the week and attacked the week it's very it's very disturbing but it's also very logical in terms of like biology right we're trying to make it difficult for males to breed it's not like we have very few people and we're trying to make as many people as we get no no it's like the Baha'i status males in the dominant males are competing against each other males in order to be able to breed with you know whenever ya lizards are fucking

<timemark seconds="7620" />

wolves are any any any species to get high status male wolf is the one who gets to breed with the the choice females in this is how they're carrying their jeans on it happens to deer and happens in Elk it happens at all these different animals and they fight me the reason why these these antlers on this elk fighting that's all there for the actually lose those fucking things after they're done breeding really fall off and they grow back again the next year that is the fastest body part growth known to man is elk antlers and that look at me the way you look at it looks like it would take 70 years to grow up the girl those motherfuckers in a couple of months and then it'll grow bigger next year up until a point sometime around like age 9 or 10 sometimes a taper off and start to decline as I get older their antlers actually become smaller and smaller but for the most part that's one of the reasons why people want to shoot a big mail it is cuz that mail like with big antlers that mail spread

<timemark seconds="7680" />

is genetics for many many years so his jeans are long past on he's probably bread with dozens of female obviously been alive long time and had that family tree does hanging out of the front of his head exactly and you know okay this thing is already it's already prospered status big meals it's actually better for the population because then the younger males get a chance to become older cuz I'll tell him they they kill young male see if a young male gets fucking frisky and he thinks he's a badass the big old Bowl come up and one of the ways they fuck him up as their antlers or longer so they can get the young one when the young one can't get him nothing it's kind of like your your weapons are dictated by your age it's really weird right and you strengthen like how by how much Vitality you have that's what grows your antlers out in that I mean this fascinating that's how it all and that it's all

<timemark seconds="7740" />

together like that is fucked up and they bully the shit out of those young balls they chased him away like you get no pussy those those young Bulls are they called satellite Bulls they're so horny are they hanging on the outside looking to lose that's why there are susceptible to Hunters Ghost Hunters alike make a cow calling

<timemark seconds="7759" />

they make the sauce and then they get shot

<timemark seconds="7764" />

that's how they get that's one of the things about elk hunting it's so interesting so you call them in now actually make sounds to try to bring them towards you if they think they're going to get some pussy or they think there's a fight at the other thing you do you make a bugle horn to blow and then the the the ELCA what you want some of this bitch don't come around the corner like why the fuk up and then and shoot them would you ever get in like a suit or anything like that and do it now that's trying to be an alcoholic sneak up on them they have actual elk decoys that they use that they actually put on the front of the bus so like say if you're shooting your bow right. Your bow hair extending in front of your bow is like a it looks like like like a female elk it's like a d-CON you're actually shooting through her

<timemark seconds="7816" />

at the elk oh okay it's like a decoy that you put on a front of your butt your drawings accubow we got something here to eat pussy but without a weapon in it elk boo no that's her what is this what is weird popped up when I packed and it's a new product was it say adjustable fit ball cap so what is that a good way to get shot by a dude that's a good put one of those on and wander off to also that's what that is what it is it's like an elk head you know has one of those John Dudley has something like that guy hit like here's you where's the chicken are tricking him I don't think their vision is very good I think their vision is

<timemark seconds="7862" />

have you ever watched any of them have sex right yeah yeah I saw one of them I saw a male elk fuck a female he was crazy really is a pretty cool or is it he smashed it so hard she went flying forward when she got tackled went down to a front knees. He just climbed on top and what he's a one pump chump he just slammed into it could you tell he felt good after he seem like he's screaming when they're fucking and when they're in in heat and air in the rot they caught it's amazing to watch this is something they only do once a year so

<timemark seconds="7899" />

for 11 months out of the year they're cool with each other they're all just hanging out together one month out of the year it's chaos just fighting to the death with other males play Bang it out and then when it's over it's over and then it is a cycle of life and then in the spring the new calves are born and then you know they they grow up and then a year later they're hanging around the the pack and then they get older is it they got all the challenge the old bull predominance March and yeah it's it's a fascinating sort of ecosystem when you want it in you know there's always rules and there's always bears and all those things are trying to eat them in mountain lions are killing them to mazing

<timemark seconds="7943" />

that's why I'll man that's why it's good that's need to use so in tune with all of that stuff man and that you you know you're into this world that sounds like a lot of fun you know but it's really interesting even if I never ever hunted again I would still be fascinated by Wildlife yeah it's just it's one of the more interesting things about being alive though there's these other things that are alive to and there Nothing Like Us yeah they are nothing like us where the outliers really for sure for sure but we're the ones who are separated from them so completely that we seen one it's like a bird sitting on a flagpole you know it's fucking coyote in your neighborhood what you doing here you know like or a dog which is like our friend you know. I don't even count them as animals I know their animals but there are friends it's like when you have dogs either depended upon us for food are part of the family two totally different deal than like a pet wolf or a pet

<timemark seconds="8003" />

or some shit there's an episode where somebody's dog plays Family Feud with him and I'm saying so that's what I was going to do that I saw dude online who I talked is he trade his dog to get him a beer and put a towel to the door of the refrigerator you say go get me a beer and the dog would go there she would grab ahold of towel pull on it would open up the door to the fridge should reach in grab a can of beer run over hand a can of beer to him he said good now go close the door and she would go close the door should go grab that towel and use it to shut that door like that is insane that is a super train animal man yeah I never had a dog and I were talking last night that comes to about your dog and you you know you guys always seem to be super happy like when you're running and everything you're talking about school ever have any pets no I never had any pets

<timemark seconds="8063" />

it was like Rottweilers Doberman you know soon as I take it wasn't nobody had a pet like everybody had like they were two dogs are like fun you know you see I'm fucking it sometimes like a tack and people just kind of exciting but it wasn't like and then a lot of animal got hit by my house by this highway by truck since we go bury the animals sometimes oh really yeah so we could get the animal you don't pull them right off the highway and barium but but yeah I never had a pet but I would like to have one if I can get a home one time you know what a home in like a wife and stuff and I think I would like to have an animal you know really know what you getting into if you go out of town you going to need somebody to watch it and feed it and take care of it and it got to get that going to make sure you have a big enough yard or dark and get some exercise yeah it all over the place going to have to learn how to pick that up you have to pick that shit up yeah you know it in like a hole or something nope

<timemark seconds="8121" />

nope they ship wherever they go outside they just find a spot and say there's a good spot to shit they just drop logs

<timemark seconds="8128" />

and then you got logs all over your lawn if you go to days without clean those logs you got eight logs I'll pick up a bunch of Lagos logs smell is going to be out in the yard looks so really no scraper and scrape the logs and I have a side dump them into yeah scooping up shit match of your grandma just shit all over your yawn just go out go on the lawn just sheesh it's in the yard shits on the lawn like yeah I love her but God I hate cleaner shit yeah I would hate cleaning up probably human chip for some reason but I remember than dogshit will when I was a kid that a boy on our neighbor and then marry a right and he and he was dude he in

<timemark seconds="8188" />

Diane actually did some pills and drove into an embankment but he when I was young he would shit in his yard make me bury it and that's how that's how I was allowed to be friends with him how do you make you bury it he just asked me to do it and I was afraid not to do it at they said yo dude young I believe this but I took a shit and it's not my your I can't even borrow it because I throw up do me a favor go bury it yeah he was he did he was dark man he had a V-8 a real dark vision and he would he would I mean probably honestly dude I said he probably should 200 300 times I buried it I swear to God I swear to God

<timemark seconds="8227" />

I swear to god dude and he did not run out of places to make new holes then you ever dug up old shit to put a new shit oh yeah I wouldn't be surprised man we basically had like the only set up a had not even have a strong system the only set up I was like one of those plastic you know Beach oh no set up at 7 so wait a minute checking you got older he was older and two years when you're 7 is a long stretch know when you 32 32 34 let them eat shit whatever dude seven and nine that's a big stretch it at your house buddy that's what I tell people no

<timemark seconds="8265" />

but when he would what was the do you remember the first there's no way you really remember I remember I have said what he said but I remember how did it happen how did happen we find yourself with the plastic shovel and another person shit going damn how did it come to this well it came to it because he I know my brother part wasn't around and I wanted somebody to play with and he was older so I was hanging out and he was DD Ant-Man how so he just had a little bit of like like he was kind of Slytherin you know what I'm talking about my mom he knew how to manipulate you yeah he was buried shit 200 + x like there wasn't here the same color in the outside of Zion the inside of Zion I'm talking about yeah like a light. Interesting but he when you first found yourself do you remember them the feeling that you first found when you were digging a hole for a dude shit like just thinking what am I

<timemark seconds="8325" />

what time do this but if it keeps asking how do I stop this how do you want up stopping that's maybe a better question and you know what I don't remember how it kind of funeral pant you know how he kind of gave Peter I don't remember how I cut a tapered how come we don't have any missing toilet paper I think he was lazy I'm serious any shot outside behind a slide down a slide in the yard cuz that even a little bit of money and he shot outside behind the slide is a great word to by the way it was silty kind of soil and sand and I remember going over then I still remember I remember the shade of it honestly would it look like I would say like a taupe but a little bit a little more Brown in it you can always find coyote shit cuz it has like a little berries in a lot of times coyotes eat all kinds of things yeah yeah eat some berries sometimes I'll see these Logs with his little red berries and I'm like it's coyote shit

<timemark seconds="8385" />

Brown to the shit super consistent weird gooses have fancy shit sometime they can see him you mean disgusting yeah I never liked it but it seems yeah I'm excited and it's a bait and switch my mother nature cuz if you see a goose you think all this fun this can be exciting and then no fucking choke out an infant at a park I mean gooses are violet Violet Violet they fight in packs do that yeah they do I have a friend sorry had a house on a lake and they had a wire all around the lake I was like what's the wire for dogs to keep the goose from going into the water that they didn't want them Wata land into the water said it was like I was like I'm not sure if it's electric make him a little shocked the idea was to try to keep the because they shit all over their lawn this shit I say pond in their yard

<timemark seconds="8445" />

I like the kid Mary I could have said they can marry her but a bird I'ma ball into you and you have a pond in your yard what you want to go fishing out to Take 5 Steps out of my backyard you know me. That's like the ultimate but I don't think that's it I don't think if you have a natural healing your yard kind of I don't think that's that expensive to get water put it in to get a pump put in I don't think it's that drastic W nightmare but they're going to make sure it doesn't leak like you had like what's going to keep the water there is it takes a special kind of bottom like when you go to a natural lake like that's the water pool up there for a reason like that's an unusual ground you got to realize you're looking at a natural Lake Mississippi I show Lake of the water's decide to stay there where is the same amount of water is probably landed everywhere but it's decided to stay there what the hell difference between that ground and all the other ground around it so when you want to make a pond you just can't make a pond everywhere there's a reason why

<timemark seconds="8505" />

is not app on there that's not the kind of ground for a pond right there have to put a liner in I got to tame mother it's like taming Mother Nature almost to do something you can't just pour water in there you got to do something and want to things they do in a lot of places that uses really thick Koi pond liner it's basically a plastic liner she had a bullshit ass fake pain is what you got that they look shitty gato above ground pool above ground pool of Pawns it's not even organized you know once they get the the blind place then they put surface levels of dirt and rocks and stuff over the line or so it looks like a regular pain but the thing is what's holding the water in place in some places they still use those Koi pond you'll see it you know what a koi pond liner that they use for the base of that shit is that stuff on float tanks 2

<timemark seconds="8560" />

I got a lot of it is extra float in them or took a real thick durable tough plastic does it feel like you're alive and you're in the tank yeah it feels like you're relaxing you know it's a good feeling feels good on your body to alleviate attention but it also feels like you're in this like meditative State you relax and you think about things better there you got a good good thought of you know what how to look at things from an outside looking in perspective yeah you get a chance to be away from your body really cuz you're not thinking about your body just floating I like that you're not feeling your body at all and the water is the same temperature as your skin so you don't you can't even tell where the water is and where the

<timemark seconds="8608" />

where your body is all like that yeah just feel like you're flying through the air and it's all dark and you don't see anything you don't hear anything cuz your ears are underwater does it feel dead do you feel like it might be dead or not know.

<timemark seconds="8620" />

I like they worry about the feeling of dead I'm just worried about how does the Fizz any like does your brain keep going you know or whatever it is it keeps us going in our like it would be like is our Consciousness does it just leave out of the shell and then we're just part of the straight up fucking I think part of the thing is when we were thinking about Consciousness were thinking about language so we're thinking about the way we talk and think it's not about a feeling yeah because I think what we think of his Consciousness when I think of it it wouldn't my own limited mind when I think of Consciousness I think of Consciousness is me using language to interpret how I feel about different things I have different language attached to it I think if something happens when you die in your soul goes to another place that sell his soul is a real thing or Consciousness a real thing I bet it goes there with no language and I bet that's it's real similar I bet to what it feels like when you're really Trippin

Isaiah when you're on some heavy psychedelics and you just melt into the universe and you you sort of cease to exist on some of them like 5 Meo DMT you ever been on that mountain to the center of the universe if you feel like you don't exist anymore I bet death and it at feels like you're dying to know that's a scary one 5 Meo DMT is universally disturbing model keyboard problem with that one is it really does feel like you're dying can senior citizens do it or not I think that I think that the only problem would be if you had a heart attack freaked out I think it's toxic cuz your body makes it your body knows what to do with it to your body knows how to bring you back down a sobriety levels in like 15-20 minutes do you know when you're going into those kind of when you're an alien some of that do you get a feeling that if you're a good or bad person just as you could do you get like an ant that like I'm bothering you about your behavior you know

<timemark seconds="8738" />

if you are you have something that's that's haunting you and maybe it was a lot of people that it really comes down to Life Choices not just in terms of like their behavior but even like what they're doing with for a living and how they live in their life and sometimes those experiences the Psychedelic experiences can highlight these things that are bothering you but that you're suppressing and then you realize like this suppressing of these feelings and thoughts is actually making me laugh out in these other ways I've got shity behavior and aggressive in this way and it's really because of this why it's really because of and then you might also come to realization it's about something that happened when you were a child it's about feeling unprotected or unloved does a child and it's just you never develop properly so you never felt Totally Secure so you want to do something to make you feel secure with his drinking or something and then you'll see that in a

<timemark seconds="8798" />

psychedelic experience you be able to like see the root of it better. Wow a lot of people at cessation of smoking comes from that feeling of this is killing myself cuz I hate myself like I'm dumb dumb literally poisoning myself like how can I not see this and then through having a mushroom experience have just completely quit really start yeah it's a real one real common one there's a lot of other stuff that I haven't done that they're all so what like ibogaine is a big one for getting people off drugs it's a huge yeah I heard about that that's a big one that is an amazing success but it's supposed to be really brutal in the end it is far as like how you feel like lugging it runs you through the ringer psychologically but when you get through it it's worth it for hours and who you have to go with by yourself since a lot of clinics that do it in particular in Mexico a lot of people go down to Mexico and go these clinics in their 24-hour Clinics of this I began experience Jerry field trip

<timemark seconds="8858" />

but hey man if you have a son and if you like Joe Mike my son's hooked on oxy I don't know what to do I would a hundred percent recommend you do that really connects to addiction it's really fast drug Hamilton Morris who is the host of vices Hamilton's Pharma copia to essentially a show that's all just about drugs and he was talking about last week when I found fast and it is and in low doses it actually is like a nootropic can actually enhances your Consciousness and low doses makes you smarter

<timemark seconds="8894" />

yeah LOL yeah you know I want to get into some of that kind of stuff but I'm not you know so we're not on party anything like that so I struggle with that it's like me and you know because I don't

<timemark seconds="8905" />

you know it's tough cuz I do want to be able to be do things are beneficial for myself and things that I didn't have a problem with but it's hard it's hard to kind of balance what is a worthwhile goal and if you can go from being a person who is doing a lot of drugs and ruin in their life the person who's like yourself it's on a great path and you're sober to discipline you wouldn't want to break that like rice you don't want to have that bad feeling but there's ways you can achieve certain psychedelic states without any drugs yeah one of the big ones is yoga and meditation those are two big ones yeah I don't do the kind of yoga that gives you a psychedelic experience I think mostly that's Kundalini Yoga but the kind of yoga that I do that Bikram hot yoga should it's just this to this what it does to your body and chills you out afterwards I think it has a pretty profound effect on the way the world the way you experience the world

<timemark seconds="8965" />

after the classes that people don't take into consideration like

<timemark seconds="8970" />

one way in which you can change the world around you is a change how you interface with the world and how you experience the world how are you viewing it what is your what's your behavior flavored by is your behavior motivated by frustration and and weirdness and insecurity and anger or is your behavior motivated by love and confidence and happiness and are you like are you quenched physically do you feel good physically yeah and if you do and if you'd like experience like a strong yoga class and then you run into someone you might be more relaxed more compassion more easily in that that'll change the way that person thinks about you that will change your interaction with them in the future there but might change your whole life yeah and if you continue to act that way and you continue to look at the World Through The Eyes of this this very particular discipline it's really good for your body you really can change people

<timemark seconds="9030" />

yeah so if you want to just do something for you I'm just meditating on learn how to meditate meditation chair actually yesterday maybe getting into it too when I'm at I mean if you were interested in doing drugs right when I just be interested in doing something that you know you can definitely do and it's not going to fuck you up and it's only going to help you yeah

<timemark seconds="9049" />

when you were when you were partying what was your thing just doing cocaine by myself at the house really cocaine cocaine the booze bother you know I just couldn't have a drink because I'll be afraid that I would because I would buy a coat so if you got drunk then it would loosen your inhibitions and be like where's the coke with the fucking comb and here's what happened so I you know I would get I would do some cocaine at the house and put on a different vest

<timemark seconds="9081" />

now I spend too much on him but I would probably say the priciest want to have it by about $210 9 a.m. and so I would get fucked up and put his vest on put on sunglasses not let me know like Buffalo Bill ship but at least partying by myself you know I want I was making a smoothie you know cuz I you know I have I got like a new one what kind of blender is but it's pretty nice and I was making like a nice smoothie and I'm fucking coked up on party and you know I'm living high on the hog two vests on maybe right and I thought I thought I heard something outside right which is kind of weird even think of we have a blender going right so I'll leave out of my apartment to go in the hallway lock myself out with the blender going to have to go to my landlord dude who lives right down the hall and tell him like hey man I got locked out

<timemark seconds="9141" />

daddy must have hated you owe the blender shorts out and smoke happens the fire alarms are going on in the building right as I'm at his door knocking right now he's pissed and he's like what's going on and I didn't know what to say I told him that I was throwing a late Christmas party dude it was fucking end of January moon a few years ago so I was Cody

<timemark seconds="9180" />

oh my God I'm a man but that's it it was fun oh my God

<timemark seconds="9188" />

that was fun how long you live there for I still live there yeah we passed

<timemark seconds="9201" />

how long you been sober for

<timemark seconds="9206" />

2 year in 2 weeks every two years what was the big thing where you like I got to get my shit together you. I was going on Opie and Jim when they open Jim Norton had a radio show it serious and it was actually on its on Ari's that show that he had this is not happening and I ended up doing coke all night driving a taxi I was in a taxi the driver this dude Luigi got me an escort I don't want to ask what we're doing cocaine like Harlem or something North Harlem cab driver doing coke and I just had I was taking a cab from a party to my hotel and so we end up off on this other Excursion next you know I'm driving the taxi he's in the back with the hooker it's 5:30 in the morning and I got to be on the radio station at either 6:30 or something so I get to the radio and I can't even talk and and Darryl Strawberry's the other guests right who's the baseball player who also had drug problem

<timemark seconds="9267" />

but he's like 13 years sober and so is this weird moment we're like I thought I was kind of cool but then here's a man who like I'd always in my head maybe some more thought oh that guys like a Coke head and here he is eloquent put together successful and here I am I can't even talk and I'm with two men that I admire you know me and Jim Norton just to be honored to be on the show you know and so I was like this is I'm not making choices like this some this some uneven this year you know so what did you do after the 12-step program program yeah and then so yeah I've been in that help me out you know I would definitely say don't do Coke yeah the problem with drugs is they're all under the same blanket right you know when someone says drugs you think of

<timemark seconds="9314" />

everything you think I'm pills you think of was smoking it you think of coke think of pot think of mushrooms think of everything yeah but obviously they're not all the same thing yeah it's weird to call them all drugs yeah they did affect you very differently the hundred percent I don't think if you did mushrooms you would all the sudden be doing blow and yeah I don't think so either cab again right I don't think so either so but I think I would like you are but you know I feel like it's something that I think about sometimes and but I let you know I don't know cuz I also do want to have experiences were like I'm able to get you know unique experiences out of my out of my mind and think about other stuff and like you know I do remember times for mushrooms we just clear my conscience it would be like someone came up to the chalkboard where everybody written all these math problems and bullshit somebody on a dick and somebody fucking cutting off somebody's head just stupid shit and just clean it all off you like

<timemark seconds="9374" />

no I think so too is relaxing mushrooms forgive you allow for your mistakes in this is one of the reasons why I like mushrooms and Jesus are always kind of connected in folklore in a lot of people's ideas because they're both very forgiving

<timemark seconds="9394" />

like

<timemark seconds="9396" />

here's the best Jesus story of someone being forgiving God damn, there was a guy named General butt naked you heard of that guy real man yeah he lived in Liberia and he's a famous character in Liberia because of his exploits when he was in the middle of War he would he would go and and fight naked a while and he was a cannibal you would kill innocent children to eat pieces of their heart and he believed that it would protect him about it talks about it openly

<timemark seconds="9432" />

after doing this he found Jesus and he came on here he is a Sim did you have it on here so then he became his killed thousands of people apparently in in war and then according to what he said and then afterwards became a preacher

<timemark seconds="9456" />

and talks openly about the fact that he's like killed innocent children and eating Reese's of their heart but people forgive them

<timemark seconds="9464" />

because he's a preacher so his love of Jesus

<timemark seconds="9469" />

is so complete the people forgive him the point they forgive the fact that he ate kids wow imagine powerful it was your kid that this guy at 8 let me see him out preaching now I'll be pissed if I was a different man it's crazy the guy was called the vice travel guide to Liberia

<timemark seconds="9501" />

it is a really

<timemark seconds="9505" />

really eye-opening sort of view into what Liberia's like my beer is it really really poor dangerous part of Africa that was originally when slaves left America when they were set free they went back to Liberia and that's where they settled fuck yeah dude always fucked up huh yeah that sucks man yeah that's why I am all these wild animal stories from Africa and so is another one that was kind of interesting these poachers get eaten by a lion they try to get a hold of a rhino they were trying to steal and kill as Rhino and cuts horns off and try to sell them needs to get eaten

<timemark seconds="9551" />

That's crazy dude too that's where to go if you could get an animal organ put in your body would you do it

<timemark seconds="9559" />

will be the benefit would you get

<timemark seconds="9563" />

I do something that would you like a hyena but when I'm so excited but I would probably get just something I'd start up for something small probably 15 or wrist or something or like a pinky nail the leopard going to be able to do with people you can be like they got Tiger. Woods Condor cat member you can play Thundercat most definitely go but you think there's a scientist yeah I met a guy and hybrid yeah I could see it man I met some motherfuckers dude

<timemark seconds="9615" />

mother fucker

<timemark seconds="9618" />

yeah well I think they're going to be able to do something like that soon they can you imagine that you fucking a talking to somebody and then they just get into a birdbath this is a humanzee thing scientists claim us lab engineer to manzi human chimp hybrid a hundred years ago science really recent article huh this isn't science alert

<timemark seconds="9643" />

oh this is the sun super sketchy right yeah that humanzee was real weird though the thing walked upright a lot yeah and they wore a suit

<timemark seconds="9654" />

what does that mean honey that's Stones humanzee experience but that one picture is real. The one next to the one you're at that one that's real that's what it really looks like the thing walked around with shorts on yeah little side of his quad son that mother fucker will tear you apart yeah that thing I think it got very close to the woman to which became an issue look at the hell is that who is that that's the humanzee I think the other thing is that the guy from Norco to send the background like that's from some spaceship

<timemark seconds="9702" />

at what language is that I don't know I'm ready for a tall man that looks like it should be on

<timemark seconds="9712" />

yeah don't don't go back translated make it does look like like it's from space

<timemark seconds="9721" />

I give you saw that on you didn't know anything about Asian languages do you saw that on a spaceship people do you think Japanese people could be from space and not know that they are the people that are really into nonsense

<timemark seconds="9735" />

I'm like that Zachariah sitchin you know about all that shit this people that believe that there is a planet that's out far outside of Pluto that comes it's a note on an elliptical orbit and it comes near Earth every like 3000 years or something I forget what it's called Nibiru and on Nibiru there are these people called the Anunnaki and what they are is an alien race and it is alien race engineered us and they took

<timemark seconds="9769" />

they took these old monkeys like ancient hominids and then they added their DNA to him and created a human being this is the idea and then there this is Guy zecharia sitchin books on the stuff

<timemark seconds="9783" />

and there's a lot of people think he's full of shit but it's interesting it's fun it's fun to it's fun to speculate you know but the idea was that different groups of people got different level of alien will look sometimes I'm talking to somebody on my account think this dude like a full person you know

<timemark seconds="9803" />

like who who who do we know don't tell

<timemark seconds="9807" />

I don't know if it's anybody that we know I mean Josh Martin there was their kind of shy sometimes it takes me for a ride but I don't think I owe the whole time I'm just getting out of chain you act like that I'm sure that some chick out there that's fucking alien

<timemark seconds="9827" />

I think when I really think about it I think that that would be the first inbreeding would be a chick with an alien fuck her or would be a guy who do fucking alien girl

<timemark seconds="9839" />

oh no I think now these days there's I could see some women fucking some aliens some of the some of the stories of male alien abduction are like female aliens that seduce them yeah that's how they get your loads bro dude species up and give him a heads up for free Sun Natasha Hendricks right is on her last name and just how do you say it Henstridge how many loads can your body make you she was on Fear Factor she's very nice she's very nice person I'll really get better yeah she did episode of fear factors hottest.

<timemark seconds="9879" />

horse really car was in that movie oh I love Forest Whitaker Ghost Dog I'll look in the Hustler and he's in Last King of Scotland he was in The Color of Money. Do you know what movie I like is on that movie where they escape from the mental health facility and Michael Keaton's in it and it's like for do they go to a baseball game ever that movie well there's always dudes in movies that would play those guys that would play some ones who was mentally challenged oh yeah that's a common thing do today with you didn't Sean Penn play some one yeah well I am Sam challenged

<timemark seconds="9936" />

Dustin Hoffman

<timemark seconds="9938" />

did he do it all that's right wing man Rosie O'Donnell Dustin Hoffman's Pro the first guy to play a super autistic man yeah and he did great I think so and that's the last thing you want your enemies finding out imagine the outtakes read you monster and now they get to a real person with the disease on the side of the stage so like a crazy man come on really I'm sure you think they're letting you do that without having somebody there to verify if it's legit or not why would someone verify whether not like someone going to come up and go that's that's not how I do it I just

<timemark seconds="9996" />

Luchador green, let's try just made that up

<timemark seconds="10006" />

why didn't you wait inside for riding the bus with my sister

<timemark seconds="10018" />

well pretty good I'm wonder if you could do that movie today you might not be able to do it and you can't even barely breathe out there dude it's tough right I can't believe I'm going to China and everyone or you can do anything can you do anything as far as like comedy material so I think of all the different stuff they have animals are treated differently there that's true you know right but I think you get in trouble if you like Google certain websites like to have a different version of oh yeah they're censored yeah yeah I'm not going to do anything drastic like that crazy good sensor a billion people how the hell'd you do that that's pretty impressive dude I remember going when I was a student we went to Cuba when I was a student in college right now I remember we went to a bookstore in all the books just started at like a certain Year and that was it like there was no imagine and it was like in the 19

<timemark seconds="10078" />

whatever when Castro took over from there like Che Guevara World Cup kiss spark social media debate on sexual harassment in China Visa mail reporter in these two Russian fans give him a kiss while you're driving and it's cause like a reverse sexual harassment debate and transparent a big deal what's a big deal that in China someone like you're not allowed to show public affection like that is that with the big debate is a bunch of the salting the dude the other way around I'm going to go on a limb he's going to be okay he looks fine looks better than kissed on the cheek by attractive women did not hurt them too can't read them I think he's going to be okay let's watch on boy get mauled by these hot Russian brides

<timemark seconds="10133" />

Airco swap kiss nothing

<timemark seconds="10137" />

nothing he's fine he's laughing he's a fucking crazy the guys laughing he thought it was cute yeah why would anybody make a deal out of that it's a zero-tolerance literally had a plastic red cup in her hand which is the universal sign for being fucked up in public yeah if you got that plastic red cup in your hand that shakes probably lit kiss that guy he thought it was cute they didn't move them around a push him or salt him his a friendly gesture on the cheek that's love I think why was trying to shut down people enjoying each other I don't think we are anymore I think I think things are I should think things are getting in a lot better place in it just on in the media it seems like they're not sometimes you know that that that seem like the not affect someone's making a big deal out of that guy that's true you can't you can't compare that to a bunch of guys doing that to a girl it's not the same it's not devastating

<timemark seconds="10197" />

going to be fine it is different men and women are different in that case that is a very clear-cut case of no one got hurt they did they interrupt his broadcast perhaps did they ruin what he was trying to say and I don't know what even made might have a serious message and these hotrussianbrides come over and kiss him on the cheek maybe they fucked up his little project and what he's trying to accomplish yeah but I'm not the same if there's a bunch of dudes doing that to a pretty girl yeah some gorilla looking fucking football player to her fucking corn-fed Iowa boys came over and kissed Roblox what are they doing remember when they were trying to make it a big deal because Katy Perry kiss some guy on American Idol yes that is like 2 months ago I never kissed a boy

<timemark seconds="10247" />

she gets them brought over kisten there was alcohol

<timemark seconds="10257" />

Katy Perry and if that guy's really complain to Carrie Katy Perry took her kiss me to love you shut the fuck up if you can appreciate Katy Perry kissing you already too pretty and more people will love that man because Katy Perry kissed him Idol contestant shuts down Katy Perry I'm going to shut down the Katy Perry backlash he kissed her to listen nothing wrong with that looking first for home he's gay right is he fell down that is not a male movie that's not okay

<timemark seconds="10297" />

it might be that he's avoiding that kiss until he really did find the woman that made him feel like he wanted to be kissed and maybe she stole from them yeah it's here it's here imagine if its 33 year old male artist ripped in 19 year old female auditioner do teeth like Katy Perry imagine that's a different thing you fuck about you imagine that's a whole different thing Volkswagen what are we doing dude

<timemark seconds="10341" />

swords sword not the same thing everybody's okay that Chinese guy was laughing man I'll probably jerk off to the video on the house multiple times over there you can imagine I have different fruit in England Aquaman excited I'm excited I guess I'm nervous but I'm also excited how many shows you doing over there I'm doing three shows but you know I don't know if I got hit me up literally over email and like to Nick's you know I'm going but I'm tied up in a basement under a noodle shop somewhere to eat after Christ are you looking for the food no man do not like Chinese food I mean not like about dude somebody told me that you can eat animal dicks over there you can eat fucking elbow grease

<timemark seconds="10401" />

I think you just joking around the right I don't know honestly think about it and they said we heard you on Joe Rogan Experience and we have a hockey rink and we prepared to put on the lion fight are you prepared to watch weed if they brought to you to a place and they said he's going to fight a lion with a sword you could leave if you like yeah would you stay

<timemark seconds="10427" />

I would say you have to show it to them if the man's already going to fight and I'm the only imagine he comes out the side of it and nobody's at the fucking the stadium well you have to be able to trust the people that are there that they going to let this guy get ripped apart by lion in front of you and then get rid of a body yeah would you eat during it or will you wait to eat after

<timemark seconds="10452" />

is the guy depends on how hungry cause I think I might wait yeah I think I looked over your fucking eating place by eating a hotdog with his guys getting mauled and he looks makes eye contact you like Siri

<timemark seconds="10467" />

are you just saying that honey mustard on your face and shit

<timemark seconds="10471" />

sauerkraut in the teeth drinking a beer fall movie Gladiator with Russell Crowe what is that supposed to be how long ago was that wasn't supposed to be based there was like a thousand years ago or more I'm guessing 2008 do that ain't that long we get back there you think all around was exactly

<timemark seconds="10505" />

you got to think man since that's not that long ago people were fucking 188 I was in Rome couple years back and went to Coliseum It's fucking amazing man it's crazy to be there just to feel it and then most of its missing like they strip down while the stone people stole things from and it's like it's all dilapidated in phone part but they did take you through the catacombs and serve explain all the different things but they hide these animals they got from Africa and they had kept them in the butt on the ground that's really real that's really how they did it man these animals would come out of a fucking hole in the ground and you see that first layer of people the first seat the first row seats they had to put up fucking fences and shit because the tigers would leave through the air and kill the people that were in the first row StubHub StubHub season pass

<timemark seconds="10564" />

callers imagine you get that nice ticket and you fucking you get up to get a soda you come back in your buddy just in pieces dude just the fact that people did do stuff like that we did that it's in us do you know that that's what's crazy man that you're so makes me think about stuff like that like that there's DNA inside of us that remembers that I think when people get into situations where they need entertainment and back then write like would you rather go to a play or see a dude have a sword fight against of tiger

<timemark seconds="10599" />

tiger yeah all day cuz of what plays are boring couple plays would be good

<timemark seconds="10607" />

what what playing Neverland maybe if she I mean if there's a line and on the left you get to see a guy fight a lion with a sword and on the right you see a bunch of people pretend to be cats

<timemark seconds="10620" />

I'm going to go see that guy eating shockingly the D just eat the entertainment value before death of how many do the worst stores have been written yet so what the hell do you think they were doing they had plays really I mean they had great stories and I'm sure they had great stories Good the value of human life was so much lower than going to war and the war they fought they fought with bows and arrows and Spears and swords so there's just bloodiness horrible bloody before 5 dead people on the street at the moment so maybe or like am I going to go see somebody else died in their way to go see this play and part of the problem was like the way they got rid of her shit to the streets

<timemark seconds="10680" />

touted with shit

<timemark seconds="10682" />

should have buried it like we do it around my neighborhood

<timemark seconds="10689" />

imagine of the the blowback if someone in some country did put together a Coliseum and then people started traveling there and it became like the new Hot Spot I would do that cuz you know I know it is somebody's are so starved have so many animals I think that a lot of people believe in reincarnation I would just do it million dollars that was sword fight if you had a purse of a million-dollar for someone have a sword fight in the human shield and armor and sword and helmet they can have a sword fight with a tiger

<timemark seconds="10722" />

people would sign up for that I mean I'm going to get you would know me better than anybody cuz you guys been you spend more time around you know the closest kind of thing maybe we have to some type of Gladiators modern-day what do you think would any of those men do it yeah yeah people do it what is this Jamie 2011 man fights lion to boost Egypt tourism come on come on this is real or plastic lawn chair got to Shield The Shield as shady as fuck in the fuck dude

<timemark seconds="10757" />

hell yeah a lot of room you there not a giant lion but

<timemark seconds="10762" />

this this actually happened recorded videos on CBS News Jesus Christ this guy get jacked or what

<timemark seconds="10774" />

not showing it

<timemark seconds="10776" />

it must have been a long fight and it was probably subdued

<timemark seconds="10780" />

it's obviously happening if the sky recorded then it's probably have to ice skate he had to do like a 2 minutes or something with it I bet yeah the line seems fine

<timemark seconds="10792" />

is it to climb on top drop drop down on that line imagine that balls you would have to leave town with a spear and driving through the Lion's brain

<timemark seconds="10809" />

from the top rope

<timemark seconds="10812" />

Glade spray all over the place you could do it someone would do it if that dummy got in there with that line you could definitely get if you gave someone a million dollars yeah give him a shield and a sword and armor give him some armor not all armor on you so fast your house or to be knocked out of your hand it would just crush your fucking head with its teeth or one man would do it one man would win

<timemark seconds="10847" />

maybe the the mountain from Game of Thrones the giant dude yeah battle acts like a fucking 85-pound acts who would win in UFC who would who do you think could win

<timemark seconds="10865" />

and it's not saying that the greatest of the best but who could do that guys like the heavyweight champ would have to be like Steve Bay miocic or Francis ngannou or someone giant who have to be a big powerful person did you have to be able to swing that fucking sword fast and you have to be able to take a hit 500 pound cat eat fucked up either way though you let you take one good hit like you're going to take one good hit just feel like you're just going to get fucked up I just don't think you have a chance it's a lot of the Bates about this when I was reading it earlier course I wouldn't have a good technique sure you do it doesn't matter the physical power of a line it's just so overwhelming I don't think people understand how much force it can generate how quickly can move how quickly can get you if you would just fucking spy on you and it would be on you so fast dude there's a video hilarious video

<timemark seconds="10925" />

of a bunch of dudes running away from a leopard and a leopard is Tiny in comparison a leopard is 150 lb or something like that and these fucking people are running left and right this thing's coming after them and you realize like oh my God ugly this this guy running now watch the leopard takes the corner look just look at he slides the leopard is going so fast it's running on the walls on the top like the middle of the wall above his fucking head watch how has he starts running for in the leopard comes into the picture the leopard is literally running on a vertical wall like watch this watching it comes around the corner it's running on the wall it's got so much power that it's running on the side of the wall but you can't even imagine the kind of physical speed and strength that that thing has its body it's bouncing from the side of the wall

<timemark seconds="10985" />

your side of the wall and just trying to get some traction so we can get a hold of your bitch ass way to get ahold of your bitch at you have a chance that thing that's a fraction of the size of a lion step fraction fuck man Jesus Christ in a school know this is a video game isn't it shit this one of those video games on the dark web I think Middle School leopard toad you find that thing you shoot it just got to shoot it it's not much you could do I was fucking stood up oh Jesus oh my God

<timemark seconds="11027" />

I'll talk to my board it is bitter and then ran off he got lucky yeah

<timemark seconds="11034" />

he got lucky that that there's always other people on the commotion and 4 million people of watch as to what it so as as people we're ready to see that 4 million people have safely watch that and they're not crying at a center right now or anything like that yeah but that doesn't seem real you know we watch that if you were there in real life in the hockey rink sit in those excellent Goldstar seats in Mexico oh no dude I want to come around here

<timemark seconds="11074" />

I tried to climb the fence and got you wow it doesn't know what it wants right

<timemark seconds="11087" />

it doesn't know what the fuck it wants to jump in the water to think they swim she's bleeding or not it's his blood I don't want that on there. I just think we really need to understand when you talk to talking about a large predatory animal really need to understand what pitches we are the toughest man that ever lived is a weak ass bitch compared to a leopard just a fact

<timemark seconds="11118" />

oh Jesus who this one

<timemark seconds="11123" />

fuck man who's doing all this this is in India right it's so crazy imagine that it's a small animal and compared to a lime comparison

<timemark seconds="11142" />

Etsy on sale for Rapids Pet Shop bring it home I think I've seen enough today well I hope you realize that if you're ever in a confrontation one of those animals

<timemark seconds="11156" />

it's going to be difficult yeah do you realize that have that you're mine now yeah I think it's not a game in which I thought it was more of a game why I think this I think it would be need to go out and Hunt some type of an animal with a knife to to start to get my guard up on an animal with a knife on a raccoon with a knife yeah do you think you could do you think they're back on my fuck you up though no man how quick do you think a raccoon moves like if you don't get that first stab into the router how long do you think it takes for the thing is last a hold of your face cloth on your eyeballs out of your fucking head and you're feeling your eyeballs getting sucked out of your skull cuz it tears to your tissue paper thin eyelids like they're nothing and it just biting man chewing your eyes out no I think

<timemark seconds="11212" />

if it got on you will do the tough part is if it gets on you you can't stab it because you'll stab yourself Kevin Rose who's Kevin Rose got it checked downstairs raccoon was fucking his dog up at the guy who loves his dog he said he didn't realize he was doing it was just doing it before I even knew was happening but look how he did it he talked it like a like a pillow wolf bitch damn damn Instinct of a man you know what I was saying was with those guys were talking about when the encounter that grizzly bear they just you reach this survival mode you have your regular operating system and then there's survival default mode when some real shit goes down in the fucking grizzly bears right next to you while I would hate that it will I think that you know going

<timemark seconds="11272" />

it's like we were seeing her like that's the moment you find out who you are and I would hate to find out at that moment that I'm not a fighter you know that all could be built up right you can build that up to martial arts right that you like there's people that are just naturally inclined to never quit and then there's people that have to learn it but you can learn it yeah yeah I want to start learning some of it to have just a little bit more of that just a fill in whatever that space inside of me is sometimes I feel a little bit in fear I don't need to feel Invincible Invincible know but I do I wouldn't mind getting a little call in some of those areas where it's like okay if somebody grabs me like I I know that I'll be able to grab them back some beginner classes start slow it's fun to man you really enjoy it as long as you're healthy guy like mentally like as far as your ego as long as you don't try to not tap piano

<timemark seconds="11332" />

I need to win I I'll just be I think I'll be happy to have a camaraderie and I would be I think the tapping is probably some humility that's really good for you it is definitely it's just hard to do especially you know when you in the beginning you try to resist you try to resist an armbar that maybe you should tap and you can get hurt that's how I can get hurt from not tapping especially other beginners they don't know how hard like a blacked-out you're more safe roll the black belt in with anybody there going to be able to tap you if they want to and when they do they're not going to hurt you right where is like somebody might get in there with some Hercule and white belt who's just learning the techniques have a chance to tap and you're right yeah that's a good point I think yeah maybe I'll see if he can help me out to get me and you can he can last night was weird weird

<timemark seconds="11392" />

here and you like why you here

<timemark seconds="11396" />

it was a weird crap it was a great crowd they were good but they they they also felt odd that they were out of show yeah I didn't realize it until you said that you like you like yeah these people are thinking it's Fourth of July with the 500 it's not wrong it's not right but it's just like does my calendar even work the weirdest crowd you'll ever experience is Christmas yeah we do Christmas shows at the store one Christmas show the store like 10 years ago I'm taking this light off for the rest of my life they were weird it was more than 10 years ago cuz you had fun though you having fun weird last night yeah it's just it's a different feeling I think people are feeling differently about comedy now because so many people are really politically correct outside of comedy and almost forced into it like you here and so many things about people getting

<timemark seconds="11456" />

fired from their jobs because of sexual harassment or from a sexually harassing Joe could someone would say jokes in the office that were inappropriate and so they got fired mishappening left and right here by the guy from Netflix that got fired for doing yeah he's having a conversation about offencive words that you shouldn't be using in comedy and because of this this conversation during this conversation about this subject he use the word Niger right because he was in this conversation did it one other time apparently because of that not calling anybody that saying it out loud yeah I was fired from Netflix

<timemark seconds="11496" />

that is crazy unless she was saying it like you like is having a good time with right like he was like you know was he saying it was he eat that's the thing right but the thing is it's very strange that that word is only forbidden by the people that can't I can't be used on rides you can't use the n-word on you if you're right but if you could use it on someone and they happen to be a person of color then that person you're not allowed to do that right very interesting man remember when I would go to when I ride my bike to school out of my black friends are get on my bike you know and they get on and I would ride him in a crush on you know and they used to call me the nigga bus whenever I rolled up and if it all call me and I honestly felt and they were my friends it was fun so but you couldn't say it and I couldn't I couldn't say it and also look I find you know when somebody says anything if it's something

<timemark seconds="11556" />

to do with a race a gender anything and they have malice or ill intent and these days I think if you do that somebody going to correct you really fukin quick and so I agree but in a business setting man in that type of setting it's just yeah but you you make people so aware that they can't I don't know how it is it is a crazy but it's also he was talking about forbidden words in, it's his business right but you're saying you can't make a sound with his mouth yeah that's what you're saying you're not he's not calling someone that name rice using that word and people file complaints about him using that were so the people he worked with ratted him out he wasn't allowed to say the word right like but the credit in it then it gets real crazy where is if you're a black guy you could say it all day and they are funny in front of white people and they can laugh right but they can't say it but they can't say they can't say yeah but if you Chris Rock you can go out with the old

<timemark seconds="11616" />

night and just have like 15 different use of that word in a half hour set yeah and it was like that was great yeah right but then yeah but it'll be the same people that say we should never say or hear this word it's interesting some people learn it from different places some people learn it from black people some people learn it from white people has a different feel a different meaning to it and I was even talking with mr. Peterson the other day who was saying you know the toughest thing I find it especially company or where I came from work you know there was a lot of racism is probably kind of went to the popular when I was younger it was a part of the it was part of the of the cloth in the end in there in the area he knows poor black and poor white and front you know poor people like the fucking fight Espino it's crazy it's like yeah okay let's be on the same team for a minute you know when we can change the world

<timemark seconds="11676" />

fun talking to someone like Peterson does it was a challenging it was challenging I felt nervous you not felt nervous because

<timemark seconds="11683" />

you know I'm not as smart as him you know most people aren't right but I also felt you know I know that you know he really admired you he mentioned in the beginning so that made me feel little bit more comfortable because we have something in common and then and then he's a nice guy and I thought he is a I tried as much as I could to wasn't trying to pick him apart nothing I just wanted to see what he cared about and he just genuinely I swear to God I genuinely maybe more than one that I've ever met he genuinely I think cares about trying to help young men feel better for in that you don't we can get in anything for little or anything like that it was mostly about you know like take a small step take a small step when you can change your life you know if you have a few of your goals he's a real Clinical Psychology and he understands the the traps that the Mind leaves works out

<timemark seconds="11743" />

and you know it so it was nice I mean you know what I think of him is like a Guevara like you know like Che Guevara but like Canadian can I take what I wanted to tell him that so bad and I forgot but you know what he's like that these kind of like a dad that a lot of us didn't hear and we need to hear again and it's like we need those reminders of some of those things and I think he genuinely to me he genuinely wants Humanity to be well that's what I felt from him the thing is when you want men to feel better women will think you want them to feel bad and this is the problem that we have with this whole right versus left male versus female black versus white any time does two groups in there supposedly pitted against each other anything positive for one side becomes negative for the other side but I think it's the opposite

<timemark seconds="11803" />

I think that if men feel better they'll be nicer to women and I think that if they get their shit together it's better for everybody and I think that if someone's looking for men's like looking at Men's values or men's lives but not disregarding women better than what we look at it that way like no you should be paying attention to women you're obviously a massage yes you're focusing on men's rights like this it's an insult to call someone an MRA which is a men's rights activist

<timemark seconds="11833" />

it's kind of hilarious you know like what is it like if someone was a women's rights activist would you ever say that would be an insult to call someone a woman's right activist or an advocate that's crazy it's openly dismissed from the feminine side making fun of the masculine side like a men's rights activist are openly dismissed yeah yeah I like to think it's him he's a lot of women's rights activist and look the strongest the hardest working man I've ever known was my mother you know and I'll say that to the end of the Earth and my mother deliver newspaper since I was born still do you know and and she sacrificed a lot of raising her children she wasn't there for us emotionally cuz she had to work all the time you know she didn't even have to have the opportunity to be but you want to talk about a feminist like I've never known one more in my life I don't think you know she had to play a man and a woman you know in a lot of in a lot of instances

<timemark seconds="11893" />

it's great that you appreciate her a lot I love you to the end of the day I mean so much to you yeah we start even like I started doing this thing will likely try and like treat a single mom out to like a weekend when I'm out of on a on a weekend of shows you no pay for the sitter pay for the dinner you know and and not to eject a single dad you know but you know for me like I

<timemark seconds="11916" />

you know I got was even talking with mr. Peterson. II never got to make like the reason I think I got in the county I never got to make my mom laugh you know like she was always who's always tired she was only working hard and tired of me just didn't have that connection you know and so I think that that's one of the reasons I got an account the only person I've ever really probably wanted to make laugh with my mother right now and then here I am like this doing all this other chick Henry on the outside when you when you first started I don't know no I don't think she I don't think she thought of anything like that I'm literally said to me I just don't think you're very funny video of the Young video usually comedy with the longest hair on the side and stuff dude that was the best man I was a really cool video I was probably like 2423 maybe maybe 23123 somewhere in that Range man crazy but I think I'd like to eat you know a lot of some of these did you know aggressive

<timemark seconds="11976" />

sometimes angry feminist they're not Mother's either and that's odd to me like you don't people get to get into something because I feel there's an imbalance yeah and if it is true feminism or the getting the being a men's rights activists I feel bad for those guys sitting a lot of those guys are just coming fucked over by bad relationships are shity divorces or you know shity laws and terms of like a child custody and then they you know this is their their response and it's what we would really like is for everyone to be treated as an individual and Ed and no groups no male versus female no fucking right versus left us all human beings individuals and I think that's like the ultimate goal for a society for healthy Society it's not it's not eliminate judging people but judge people based on their actions the words and their deeds not their sexes are there do you know but then you always can have people that want to fuck the opposite

<timemark seconds="12036" />

and you always going to have people that want to fuck the same sex to make them uncomfortable I got the I've been hit on by dudes before and been made to feel very uncomfortable yeah I'm sure you have to the only difference is I know how to fight and want to do was hitting on me I was like listen cut the shit like this with this wasn't a scene where you know like I was worried I was going to get raped was I was worried I was going to go to jail for fucking somebody up right I want to have to hurt you man but don't touch my dick again right I've been in situations before but it was never a situation where was like a woman or I was worried I was going to get held down someone's going to do something to write but you can understand them when those situations like I can easily see how women feel that way like they were way worse yeah I get that too it's like I'll get like dick pics and stuff from men into my Instagram and stuff

<timemark seconds="12082" />

bro and it's fuck him like awesome dudes are aggressive with that shit but that's zero did the something bold about a girl should send you a picture but it's those to you with my dick a girl send you something you're excited to see yes or no girl sends you pictures of her tits she's holding them she was like I heard you wanted these you like those real this is crazy

<timemark seconds="12124" />

Spanish Cedar Gatorade Walk It Off

<timemark seconds="12136" />

dude I yeah it's so it's so true that but I do know I start to notice how people feel I start to notice how yeah when that happens like how I see how you feel I see now she all women feel if they get that you get there's a door that you could look through we could see a mile away maybe where this could go right to be the person that feel that like a dude wants a stick a dick in you and shoot loads in your body video games

<timemark seconds="12167" />

that's you know that's the difference between men and women yeah and this is also why there's more anger because women of experience so many guys trying to do that to them that they develop this bad taste for men and I understand that and we need to be better man you know if you're not believe that and I want to see that's one of the reasons why you know I listen to your show it's one of the reasons why you know I'm excited you know I was intrigued to listen to mr. Peterson and reading his book and you know I do want to be a better man and it's hard even in the better human being or a woman or whoever you are if you don't want to do better you're probably going to have a fucked-up life cuz then you're not trying you're not perfect it's no way you're perfect no one who's ever lives been perfect I don't never want to say you have to pay attention every day and every day to your behavior will you think and you have to constantly being a be assessing it and moving in the right direction and when you are moving in a positive generous loving direct it feels better

<timemark seconds="12227" />

you better yeah I feel like a better person yeah you really yeah yeah you really do you know I'm glad that yeah I'm just glad to be like alive and be able to like trying like learn about shit it is exciting you know and you know I think one of the things that fucks people at more than anything this is what I've experienced with so many friends like dude you're thinking about your past like it's you and it's not you can't beat yourself up for something you did 20 years ago or the way you were going out doing coke and fucking your life up five years ago that's how you anymore yeah you did do those things yeah but that doesn't mean that you're you're not that person anymore yeah as long as you decide but if you get caught in that trap you'll be that person again. 2 months off I'm sobering up now everything's doing good and then off to the races again shows up coked up drunk comes the commies door won't shut the fuk up breathing shit breath and everybody's face like Jesus

<timemark seconds="12288" />

have sweat dripping off his ear loads we all know that dude there's so many of those dudes yeah I just can't make it they never break free they break free for a little while and never go while I don't want to be that person anymore they just go well not that person this week me and then you know they just get addicted to being sober for a little while and then next thing I know it's dark arts Dark Horse by call DARCARS just because if anything I think takes you out at like your password like some sort of Enlightenment a little bit that's what I think you know dark arts in Harry Potter like Voldemort and everybody do dirty spells and they can and everything

<timemark seconds="12332" />

yeah anything that takes you off of the path of Enlightenment yeah the dark arts that's most things done right most times you jerking off times bro Brian when you do do you ever feel good about it you ever feel like yeah that's what I said the X season like occasionally during the holidays bro not even joking so now they're in the holidays I'm just so filled with joy that the same doesn't get me do you know that it actually does alleviate anxiety and people recommend doing it before you have a performance you have to perform in front of people from your hotel room before you go to a show to be like less anxious I could see that maybe maybe for like a special or something you know

<timemark seconds="12375" />
