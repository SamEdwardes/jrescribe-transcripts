<timemark seconds="649" />

today you do to you split it up or you just don't tattle such go I go ham I'll just go hard I just mix things up like I'll run and I'll come back from and I'll kick box or I'll lift weights and after I lift weights and then I'll get on the fucking Echo Bike & or the Echo by Galleria area and then I'll get on the versaclimber and then I'll get on the road machine I just around when I can't roll anymore this fucking puddle I left behind this is a puddle on my elliptical machine Jesus fucking Christ 2 hours on the elliptical machine and this was I just want to see what's possible and then how I felt the next day I feel fine the thing is I work out a lot already so but now my body is just adjusting to like a ramped up schedule to work out in 10 plus years so for him this is like a whole new thing he still second place it's his mind

<timemark seconds="709" />

cigar my win you never know I shouldn't have to finalize that belch aiming at me on Instagram scrambled use the hashtag tag me and if you win I'll give you five hundred bucks okay look at at the best design give you five hundred bucks but don't use anybody know to get shit on the money that's why there's like a mad run here but the thing I can say is inside jokes and I do love for everybody else doing this but all jokes aside I have like zero anxiety

<timemark seconds="769" />

zero zero stress like when you burn your body out like that do like 2 hours of working out a day not yet I don't give a fuck about anything like I'm in traffic people cut me off my good cut me off dick head who cares I'm not angry like what is it because your body so burnt you think you're just so fucking exhausted feeling I feel a lot of those eyes those feelings if you have extra energy that your body has it's on necessary it's unnecessary energy in trouble but isn't there looking for danger that isn't there looking looking for something is going to like stale your food or not paid your village that shit was going to kill my family I think your body has to have a certain the way we were designed right for all the years that we were running away from wild animals and other tribes and all that shit I think you your body in your brain

<timemark seconds="829" />

have a certain amount on reserve always looking for some sort of danger look like you're see a deer in the wild that happened around the neighborhood by the way you'd have to the odds of you shooting about your what is the other walks by that lady is that a cat that's a fucking no it's not a cat that looks like a line but it's just way too casual walking by her she's give a fuck she thought it was a dog it kind of looks like a dog calm the way it walks by her that's not a wildcat I think it's a dog man

<timemark seconds="883" />

but it doesn't look like the dog maybe a mountain lion nobody knows what the fuck is terrifying or not an expert but I've seen a lot of Wildlife and tail does not look right the tail looks like a cat again the tail definitely a dog tail it looks like a balancing tail like if you look at it so I guess it's holding its tail in the air

<timemark seconds="929" />

my dad's out talking about a dog that makes its way out. If I was a cat or the dog identifies as a person now that it doesn't want to because that's his name the dog says I'm Kelvin respect his feelings it has every right to be whatever it wants to be a man yeah I fucked up fucking nerves all right to have a lot of nerve that's a fucking deeply embarrassed by myself you need to go to support group for people who think that dogs are just dogs identifiers is like a sentient being just a being it's a no it's not a cat just exists and maybe we don't have the right to define it

<timemark seconds="989" />

a cat by whose judgement by humans judge and you assigned a black people did the rules apply turkey and all earnestness I saw thing and Nick Cannon look up jive turkey decanters

<timemark seconds="1041" />

sure call me special sure Jamie smart stand up don't shoot he wears like a spacesuit what is it called what is it called when an Indian headdress on Hardware Howard Stern was giving him shit about it forever because he can't cuz he was wearing a watch called you bro he wears a turban what the fuck Nick Cannon explains his reason for wearing a turban get to that one is on Ellen

<timemark seconds="1094" />

I just don't have any breath in my body I don't remember what he said it was you know me I'm a conspiracy theories I think the government did that they set her up what is that about Mariah not I was supposed to ask Nick about Mariah's New Year's Eve televised performance that was marred by technical difficulties and he said you know me I'm a conspiracy theorist I think the government did that I think they set her up it was a distraction I was joking yeah it's like an old school motorcycle jacket but it's a white guys can't wear white jackets that's why

<timemark seconds="1154" />

yeah I want to see you wear those high-end if I had hair I wear braids that should be the bet but I'm going to wear my leather jacket bearings for cornrows it's really a white girls can't wear cornrows you have a white guy do you see white guys with cornrows I don't ever see white guys with this Nick Cannon weight gain what what the fuck is wrong with people but the guy gain a little weight you fucking idiots worry about yourself where does his reasoning for the turban I can try that picture that I posted on my Instagram about the British Iraqi genderqueer whatever the fuck is quantum physics really help me understand my queer identity I'm British Iraqi gay non-binary and identify as Muslim that is real by the way there's a video if you go to who's Instagram James Woods posted on his Twitter page you go to James Woods Twitter page and he says is that that's all EG right that's besides funny

<timemark seconds="1214" />

for that session this is Sacha Baron Cohen if you go to his Twitter page and you find it from yesterday it's interesting when you listen to this person I don't want to assume something it seems very intelligent like a very intelligent person sure but yeah I post a lot all James would just drink coffee and talk shit about liberals keep going down

<timemark seconds="1248" />

yeah just keep going

<timemark seconds="1252" />

it was Tom Cavanagh mixed in he's got some fake news mixed it's in there I like beer how much feel like beer

<timemark seconds="1265" />

response no no no I don't think so it might go large on this and bring it to the beginning cuz this is quite a lick here we go

<timemark seconds="1284" />

my name is Andrew all comedy old Andrew lambrou I'm British Rocky gay non-binary and also identifies Muslim glitteriest makeup I've ever seen in any human

<timemark seconds="1301" />

quantum physics is help them understand this queer identity okay

<timemark seconds="1306" />

no listen just fucking space cadet the pictures are insane but listen side the neutrons electrons and protons looking at the cold slapped on those arms and legs whereas classical Newtonian physics is obsessed with the universal formula tank top in all reality it's so fixed on Resolute onzas quantum physics reveals that there is no fixed reality

<timemark seconds="1342" />

okay so here's my point you can keep going on and watch this but this is a very intelligent person so why am I so dismissive why why can't this person where would you like if a woman was beautiful and she wore like a dark red lipstick but you was talkin brilliant science I wouldn't have an issue with it so why do I have an issue with this Glam roof fella fella warm Glam Rachel why do I have an issue with the bright blue glittery lips the literal rainbow colored eyeshadow with glitter the false eyelashes for real cool with all that shit I think this is like peacocking and it's at its finest form this is calling for attention to the reason that we all are like and when they get mad like what are you looking at you looking at you like you

<timemark seconds="1402" />

did the show for me to see if I was your stay in private and have your own life but you want me to react but why do I like some of it like if there's a 7 year old black dude and he's got like a red velvet suit wheeless coolest shit would like a slick Fedora and he's walking down the street with a fucking snake head silver cane you look at that guy girl look at the school motherfucker but he's peacocking as well and grabbing because they want you to do these people people who do who want to be larger than life that do things like this to express who they really are that they want to have a discussion what is this what are you what they want that one else wanted like cortical inform you or argue with you about that identity why can't you just be

<timemark seconds="1462" />

gay British Muslims agree with you questioning my judgement because it's outside the realm of normalcy from from from normal standards of what kind of the same thing you've seen for the past you know so we fit in the culture where we don't stand out or not paying attention I don't I don't give a fuk I don't have anything against this fucking person I don't know I'm going to give a shit about him I just know that this is clearly for you to go what the fuck that's why they that's why that is just exactly like this plastic rope chain with a star on it that had all diamonds you want me to say something about it that's why you were that you want me to go why the fuck do you why you wearing that shit

<timemark seconds="1522" />

why the fuck are you where I'm at if I sat here the whole fucking interview and didn't and wasn't like then go hang out what the fuck is that like the size of a Mercedes emblem if you go do I have to do you have to know my identity was part of my culture man will explain it cuz I don't fucking you still or okay how about a white guy who dresses like that but talks like he's not a white guy he's a great role he's actually so good at it do you think you really got pistol-whipped in Brooklyn and robbed or anything out of him so now I think I was all big fucking media push but I think he's a genius for doing it cuz I got him way more attention

<timemark seconds="1570" />

I think Rob is actually very smart go back sometimes know about Black Culture

<timemark seconds="1593" />

sometimes the chains come back I went to the Drake concert I bought the Carter 5 fellas listen up Jay-Z and Beyonce will no longer speak to Kanye and Kim Kardashian fat according to the fucking fake news bro Kanye West and Kim Kardashian because of his position on Trump Jamie's got to Google it but you know what the fuk UR The Daily Mail sever ties it's in hotnewhiphop.com

<timemark seconds="1653" />

77 / it's over we sever ties mother fucker when I talk to you anymore you don't come to our champagne parties why it matters people waiting for that album Watch the Throne 2 yet but this whole push about getting Kaepernick to have lunch with Trump brilliant so I can use the whole platform of SNL just to get Trump to go I love Kanye he wants Trump to be so in love with Kanye wants Trump to love him so much that he's willing to actually take a meeting with someone he's been publicly shiting on for over a year now and Kaepernick is a terrible representation of this country a basketball player bad person even dump and dumper dumper and then Kanye is going to suck her him and twist his mind into thinking he should actually sitting at lunch with them I bet my life it'll happen that Trump will go

<timemark seconds="1713" />

okay I'll take a meeting because I love Kanye and it's just out of respect for Kanye so he'll get he'll get him and fucking Kaepernick in the room but he Donald Trump's daughter cop he's not shooting black people during the national anthem that's bizarre to people just there for a game but I completely understand that you're disgusted by police brutality sure I think virtually everyone is my take on it is

<timemark seconds="1750" />

its first of all it's insanely difficult to be a police officer you have a lot of people that are police officers that have no business holding that job they're under extreme pressure a lot of them have PTSD and a lot of them their bullies and they get into this position because they want to be the guy with the gun in charge of Italy and then they have an opportunity to pull that trigger and they do and they face repercussions because song was filming it and I think that should have happened from the beginning of time played where there's a guy I posted on my Twitter it's fucking horrible of a guy shooting a white guy who's crawling for his life on the voice telling the guy to crawl towards him let me see your hands it's in Arizona and the guy's pants are falling down keeps reaching back to grab his pants and he goes he goes I will fucking shoot you if you crap your pants and the guy is crawling in his pants are falling down and tries to grab his pants and the guy likes him up in the hallway of a hotel just killed him

<timemark seconds="1810" />

the guy was crying and begging for his life and that the cop was making crawl towards him like why the fuck would you ever make someone crawl towards you it's insane and he's giving them all these confusing directions while he's in full riot gear holding a gun apparently the guy had a fake pistol like a water pistol or water gun and was holding out the window and someone saw it and they said there's a guy with a gun came in there ready to shoot somebody already and then they see this guy but the guy was clearly not a threat this guy had already been in trouble for other police brutality and got kicked off The Force you got to quit it by the way they still with video got acquitted and then they got acquitted of the murder video and then afterwards got kicked off The Voice for something else he did the guy was just an abusive guy that erases to

<timemark seconds="1870" />

it's not discounting racism some of the races to just a fucking insanely difficult job right no one respects or very few people respect and these people are in these situations everyday with their life is in danger their whole brain is frazzled I'm friends with a lot of cops I know a lot of cops when it comes to my family I know a lot of cops or MMA I know a lot I've known a lot of cops my old life like my whole life growing up my my real dad was a cop I grew up like knowing cops when I was a kid and then in a mall through martial arts new cops because cops are we taking martial arts to learn how to defend themselves right it's so fucking insane job man that's crazy it's everyday all day long you're dealing with people that are committing crimes in line utility little I knew you write you pull people over there line either drunk or on drugs got a body in the trunk it's just lies but he was why I was going on

<timemark seconds="1930" />

and I go yeah but yeah I should let me go you know why I'm white white white guy in a black dude is like my new number

<timemark seconds="1953" />

is a joke about right ball players like a pretty people like that they kneel because said they want of what they use in a platform yet anyway see the problem is there's no there's no okay the problem is if you said to Kaepernick what's your endgame to say stop all police violence is like such a vague broad things going to have a dialogue about it was what's important but the problem is they need to have we need them needs to be a bigger goal for why people are kneeling for the conversation is already being so we can talk about it when we need that there needs to be some kind of a an endgame a goal the point of that it's not going to happen but you need you need something to eat to give you something

<timemark seconds="2013" />

get to cuz otherwise this is just going to be this weird turmoil between ultimately racist people could truly the people that are yelling about it they're angry at least 20 people there like you better stand up better stand up boys it's for America then I can just because people are paying attention just about everybody being on the team together is that we're supposed to support these deals that this song is about I pledge of allegiance to the flag all this Jasmine that's what we're doing right it's a game that has no bearing on the future of the United States of America you don't do that for anything else right you don't you don't have like a dinner party and play Monopoly in someone's like we should say the Pledge of Allegiance in the UFC stopped that I really liked was saying that

<timemark seconds="2073" />

I wouldn't be here for cage fights and it's boring miserable people sing with their voice

<timemark seconds="2099" />

thinking that shaky things

<timemark seconds="2103" />

that's the funny thing about that is always like to 50,000 people at sporting events it doesn't have anything to say about the sport is my controversial country but wondering about the Olympics get that fucking national anthems at the Olympics this is just the Packers versus fucking you know the Buccaneers the bearing of American future I grow the soldiers fight for your right to be able to decipher your I feel too fucking everything

<timemark seconds="2163" />

Joe hates the American flag bitch this is trolling trolling nobody knows. Joseph down bro I can do it online like sneak tip for year we know what I'm looking at you with that make her some kid I know I'm loving every second of it what it what do you think you'd do you think you would do sober October and like take a day off for your birthday and then get back to sober and then o a day at the end of the month I start a day early I guess I could do it but I don't I don't I just died um. Jamie's do what you think I can't do it I know you do sober November

<timemark seconds="2223" />

the shortest month white ass crack crack ass fucking white crusty looking bologna stinking motherfuckers I wish there was a good slur for breeders you know for straight people that like yeah something like another man wouldn't it be good or a bad one for us normal she could use it on yourself nor you fucking normal you fucking God damn normal penis in vagina monkeys stupid ass sperm so connect

<timemark seconds="2283" />

there should be I do think there was another point of you shouldn't say pregnant woman pregnant it was supposed to say to someone that's real shit because people of all genders can have to do so in the holy fuck instead of saying pregnant women try using the phrase pregnant people keep going down because people of all genders can fall pregnant you can follow for pregnant pregnant pregnant can you call can you call in work and say hey I'm not going to be in today because I fell pregnant

<timemark seconds="2343" />

maternity leave identifies pregnant I'm not coming to work a propaganda bullshit lie of like getting us all on the same page of can have reproductive that's not true you can fabricate it is too easy to survive so people coming up with all sorts of different kinds of conflicts that they're not real I guarantee you all those people that are doing this they're not working out 3 hours a day women are pregnant say try using the phrase pregnant people become pregnant while pregnant think you are followers are pointing this out you wrote that yourself the language to use effect

<timemark seconds="2403" />

the people around you people of all genders can become pregnant because people of all genders can have the reproductive organs do so when talking about pregnancy try to use the language that is inclusive of people of all genders well there's 78 different genders now 79 is due to boredom boredom also week pussies these people that are doing this I guarantee you if there are you looking for conflict your fucking the whole life is falling apart you're a mess this idea that you're proposing that people vote first of all it's insulting to women it should be deeply insulting no shit can be pregnant the fuck they can

<timemark seconds="2463" />

women get pregnant and it's hard for them that's difficult to get insecurities of crazy mood swings with chemicals

<timemark seconds="2488" />

in the fucker

<timemark seconds="2490" />

there's only fuck it's only there's only one there's only one gender that can become pregnant woman yes that's a woman talking about things that's filled with nonsense and they this is where the fascism lies they want you to adhere to their rules and they are saying is literally against science it's not scientific and not true now if you want to tell me that some people like to identifies woman and you should talk to them as a woman give them a woman's name no problem that's fine but you can't stand there and tell me that anybody other than a woman can get pregnant have a child about

<timemark seconds="2550" />

TuneIn Stephen King okay if you want to achieve enlightenment and be revered as a living Buddha self mummification was your brutal option House of Brews Momsen spiritual path that starve themselves for almost a decade subsisting on water seeds and nuts then they'd be sealed inside the Statue and ingest Roots pine bark in a toxic tree sap base teeth for another 1000 days eating and breathing through a small tube eventually death would come in the monks mummified of this man was said to have reached Enlightenment what

<timemark seconds="4283" />

talk somebody into that what the fuck are you check it out I'm going to put you in this fucking thing bro you have to breathe through a tube dude you can only you can only drink this toxic teeth is going to slowly kill you you want to be a god you want to see for 3 years nothing but seeds I'm going to wrap you and you going to breathe through a fucking to it's going to be ultimate Panic starve themselves for almost a decade where were they piss and shit while they're in your front 2008.

<timemark seconds="4518" />

<timemark seconds="4817" />

Jell-O pudding this is great I can't I had a girl that I dated I won't obviously I won't mention new but you sure did she was 8 years ago I dated a girl in college and she was so beautiful but when she would come it was so annoying like it was like it was like it was so exaggerated I remember catching myself in the mirror want I'm giving myself this face as she was yelling I was going I was wrong with my phone and I guess I'm the fucking that like don't feel let's not play the game like the regular do not to please you yes I think she thought it was pleasing maybe doing the opposite was making me go home I guess it's regular car

<timemark seconds="4882" />

it's just punching you I just I just start crying she's coming I'm crying hydrated I think that support owed us for no trick people just want to shut it off the volume to look at her face and know she's making stupid noises yeah cuz it's stuck like I can't disassociate you don't you don't always impressive mean poor know is when like a girl is taking like a fucking 12 inch dick like some plugs and they're not being loud like I'm always like this girl's a fucking Thug with a soldier that she's getting fucked and she just like it's no big deal just looking at it that's a good point about

<timemark seconds="4942" />

like people imitate behavior in films like we're talking about all the other Guido's and imitate Godfather movies in The Sopranos imitate it they see it they want to act like it it's exaggerated yeah that's the same with porn with no it was as sex is going to be a lot of people that are emulating the sounds in the noises in the postures and all that stuff like when you think people started regular coming in people's faces

<timemark seconds="4969" />

what what year what year was the first pioneer in pornos that did like a first-come shot in people's faces on a 30-30 baby nobody born in the 50s was a ever pulled out you I mean like everyone that's just what you did and a disease and then we disease in the 70s and 80s spawn this idea of condoms and protection and then people started learning maybe we'll just not come inside of people well they say that one of the biggest changes in culture was female birth control cuz finally had control of their own reproductive site but what comes with that is that they have to take hormones to Chief that every fucking up their chemical inside dude if you ever heard like what actually

<timemark seconds="5029" />

happens to women latest just fuck up their chemical inside zit do fuck up there hormonal cycle right but it also fucks up their ability to discern whether someone compatible with them seriously science of there there's a thing that women get like there's a Chris Ryan was explaining this to me there's an actual smell like women can caramel like when did they're not on birth control I could they get guys close and like they all smell guys cause they can literally they're attracted to certain smells and the men that the smell this way would be more genetically compatible with them so therefore the pheromones literally is the Fairmont does a pheromone blocker with birth control then that's kind of women who are on birth control are much more attractive attracted apparently to Alpha Male type characters and aggressive men about birth control that makes them

<timemark seconds="5089" />

it did not sure why are attracted to alpha males attracted to alpha males it's not really a negative thing I guess they're more attracted to certain types of people in you got to think like what what is that it's like my sociology to a biologist I really wouldn't know what the fuck would be the cause of that but I would think they would have something to do with their body wanting something different than the baby that they think is inside them cuz they're supposed to be pregnant but yes is the whole reason why you can't get pregnant when your on birth control right so you're walking around constantly in the state of pregnancy so why would you be more attracted to alpha males or aggressive men that would even make sense the only thing that would make sense as you want something even more aggressive more dominant or more better protect what you've got

<timemark seconds="5149" />

all those nature characteristics of like I'm pregnant I need ultimate protection I need ultimate aggression ultimate strength like these are just all natural by the way although fucking equality website so probably like me up for that you want me go crazy while I was reading this biologists account of what's that there's a term called hypergamy that it's a natural state for women to be attracted in to seek out men with higher Social Status Hyer financial status better physical specimen that's his natural state with they're always looking for something bigger and better and it's just a genetic State and it's not it's no one's fault I mean in in women obviously don't have to give in to this but is a natural inclination that they had like if the rock is there is perfect example right he's rich and he's handsome huge friendly as a giant man and he's probably got a huge hog and your woman is naturally attracted to go tour

<timemark seconds="5209" />

so am I but this the state is it's called hypodermis woman who had this awful betrayal of this man and she was stupid through the biologist was relating it to the state of hypergamy picture of technical way instead of like saying look at this slut they were saying this is a natural state they're like women gravitate towards certain types of males you knowing that this is but this is not discussed very often it right now well we're bending all these rules and names and terms and all this bullshit it's like escapism from like the true nature of men and women exist

<timemark seconds="5269" />

nonsense but the one thing I will say that I don't think anybody talks about his the sexual and social psychology of men and women nobody wants to talk about when you are developing as a young team so I see a boy in your learning about sexuality and you're confused and embarrassed and scared and the way that men and women interact in that year from in those years from like 12 till like 16 it's insanely unstable because women are not as not ask for more aggressive technically at that time that men our rights to these men are fucking hormonal Freaks and they want to do things with these women but they're not supposed to kind of and it's like kind of okay and I don't know how to do it and do these weird Blurred Lines of women want to be accepted and cool in there come in their Circle so you know it's like when someone hooks up with someone earlier ChuChu TV hookup young and it's like it's sketchy and weird sometimes a girl gets labeled a slut for no reason it's like

<timemark seconds="5329" />

Juniors and she was dating a senior and they had sex and it was like she's a slut everybody wants to do this thing but they're these weird subset rules but every guy that does it that's just what we want to do but I don't weed there's no explanation over like how we got to the point of getting comfortable there because men are just as horny freaks at don't know what to do with the thing so there's so many Blurred Lines of sexuality in relationships at that age nobody want to talk about it well it's also the Puritan culture and religion right the right things that set women up in this terrible right you know when I was in high school everybody knew this I'm sure you knew this to everybody knew Catholic school girls were the biggest fucking freak because there are suppressed there you're making diamonds tell you taking that car back

<timemark seconds="5389" />

it's Catholic school girls right and it's all Chicago Columbus Georgia be nice be nice be right between Catholic school girls and regular girls most wonderful girl but you went to an all-girl Catholic course she was surprised complete her score was nuts man she was wild but that's but that's so that's what I'm saying no one wants to talk about then again I'm not trying to dive in the cabin of bullshit but people are young and they do fucking crazy

<timemark seconds="5449" />

when you are hormonal e at your beginnings and you're confused and weird I mean guys know we gotta start masturbating it's this disgusting weird secret creepy gross sad like undercover secret that you don't tell your friends you're my soul you're handing off and all of that is swirling inside your head over sexuality and when you do get a chance with a girl it's uncomfortable it's awkward it's weird again not talk about whatever fucking he did I'm just saying you're already in this weird state of men are fucked up when they're sexually reaching this new peak of their life that they just want to like jerk off and come and fucking and how much information are you getting from their parents almost almost almost 9 and it's our society perpetuate this weird Poulan push of like you know I don't want you know that fucking song Baby It's Cold Outside

<timemark seconds="5509" />

really should go it's cold outside the Christmas fucking song he's playing it on YouTube or will you get in trouble

<timemark seconds="5528" />

is an old boat so all I do know the song trying to fucking Bluebird up and by the way up staying at the end because she want anything other than this is the perpetuation of our culture for a long time of like this Poland taking teas at ease is a game that women play in men play two of like you know that I really can't say it's cold outside got to go away this evening has been so very nice my mother will start to worry my father will be pacing the floor I'd rather I really better Scurry maybe just a half a drink more that's her finally admitting the neighbors might think what what's a what's in this drink you're very pushy you know I like to think of it as opportunistic I see the answer is no

<timemark seconds="5587" />

has been so nice and warm my sister will be suspicious my brother will be there at the door my maidens maid is vicious will maybe just a cigarette more so so she's like yeah okay find another drink then took a lot of convincing took a lot of convincing oh my God I just got to be there if 1940s 40s baby and nobody wants to talk with nothing to do with the cabin. You know what I mean by don't even discuss our course who had a brutal take on it a brutal

<timemark seconds="5647" />

look at this is a woman who had a really brutal take on this Lee and I was on Jordan Peterson's Twitter page if you go to Jordan Peterson's Twitter page there's a woman who is I don't know what she does but she talks about how this woman who is accusing Brett Kavanaugh goes to this predominantly or she teaches at is predominantly women's college with 79% of the students are women and social justice is the number one thing that they promote the school right ahead of Education of everything when you look at the school so I can list of like what it it aims to accomplish and how to educate the students like promoting social justice is one of the primary thinks it's the first one above everything else and the ideas at why would this woman risk everything and what This Woman's take is who's criticizing this is it she's not risking anything

<timemark seconds="5707" />

warden from this culture this is a big deal and she's very cynical about this she's like this woman has no recollection does remember how she got home that's remember where the party was but does remember that someone may have tried to do something to her you know I'm not a big fan of criticizing people who come out and say someone did something to them or try to do something that you don't know you don't know you're on the outside looking in and you're you're you're trying to pick holes in their story I don't even know they know cuz I don't I don't hear it is yeah you can hear some of what this woman says like click on it and play some with this one says that we don't have to

<timemark seconds="5751" />

we buy the lifelong friend who supposedly a company blasi Ford and presumably might have noticed and remember Shannon sounds like Jordan Peterson okay but the phone is at like there's only two people I know what really happened and they don't even know what really happened was you talking about some years ago I mean if he if she said 35 years ago this guy raped me okay that's a different story this is not what she saying right what is she saying my from what I understood and by the way I distance myself from cuz I was just it was so overwhelming I wasn't that he held her down while the other dude was in the room and that he kind of helped him hell told her down and he had his penis on her we talked about this the other day like you

<timemark seconds="5811" />

supporting him anyway but that's the thing is like when you talk about it what do you say what are you in favor of his cycler

conversation about what's going on otherwise I should be informed I disagree with that because I just happened to be privy to this conversation because I'm not pretending I'm some sort of an expert or that I have some sort of information that you don't. If you have those misconceptions let me clear those up right now I'm a fucking moron talking to another moron next to another no matter what anybody it's kind of like what got in trouble for Norm you know when Norma got trouble no matter what I think you're suffering in a bad bad way it was sure the most explosion surreal confirmation hearing since Clarence Thomas Anita Hill in 1991 nominee for the Supreme Court was asked if he was a gang rapist and a blackout drunk while defending himself

<timemark seconds="5882" />

by describing how long he preserved his virginity his accuser described him grinding into NCAA covering her mouth and fearing that he was accidentally going to tell me okay well that's pretty fucking serious so if he was if he was covering her mouth because she was protesting and he was grinding into her write that down a little bit keep scrolling down please in California treated gingerly and then continue Republican to feared okay this is blah blah blah blah blah but but but that will be she became a very human being telling a terrible story about Judge Kevin on compelling terms that brought many women to tears transformed the battle for the Supreme Court okay we'll see that's all I needed to hear see that the kind of person now look I don't know if he did this but if you did do this the kind of person that covers a woman's mouth yeah it's crazy shit

<timemark seconds="5942" />

that's an extra level of Darkness if he really did that true that's what that is that's him trying to hold her back from something so Donald Trump said this you know this famous quote that it's a tough time for boys you know a girl made a song that I heard that song it's a good song and fucking mad at me her name is on Twitter it's Mercedes l y n z she has a beautiful voice and the song is

<timemark seconds="5992" />

it's a scary time for do scary time for dudes yet I listen to it a few times it's really good play a little bit of a billion views so anyway her Twitter page you going to hear this you go all your support in this fucking male bashing shit

<timemark seconds="6034" />

look it's she's just going on about how difficult it is to be a girl and when you're not a girl it's not something you consider and so all these guys of the lights on the first floor very very true she's got to listen to the whole thing that I think we're talking about you're allowed to see to see truth on all sides of all of these issues I don't think you ever have to be so staunch about anything I disagree with people that are so snobby about this is the end of discussion you're only this way or not it's like oh man I don't know all the stories I don't know all the truths of of the cabin all bullshit I don't know all the truth of anything that woman coming forward I tend to believe a woman that's going to go out of her way I don't think she's looking for fame I think I need two girls that came out for Louie were looking for fame attention one wants attention than their name Google to come up with this for the rest of their life so

<timemark seconds="6094" />

why wouldn't say that I see I don't know I didn't say no one I think most people don't want that kind of the Donald Trump what's the name of the fucking for me. I think she all she wanted was attention I'm sorry I like well I think I can send chili and all she did was make fun of his penis like she wants money she's making money from it and she's like in her forties and she still stripping and sad it's it's not because I'm just going to stand there of what happened and I believe that I don't know what it is but I believe there's something fucked up that went down and unfortunately we are in the middle of this what can be done who knows how do we say there's no physical evidence of rape

<timemark seconds="6154" />

she tried to ask me you know what happened when you and this girl making out in the backseat of a car 35 years ago looks good luck few moments I remember remember like very few sexual encounters from high school but I remember with my girlfriend was consensual so hard my ears ring and it's never happened since never happened since I peeked when I was 16 years old.

another one to see people with no hell no helmet law Texas I think we allowed to have in Nevada I mean I've seen that one but I can't tell you who what cop and pull you over in Vegas what do they do the last thing on their fucking mind I don't give a fuck it's Square states where stay perfectly square mile in 19 states that require Illinois Iowa New Hampshire this is currently 19 States and in DC have laws requiring all Riders that's a tall Riders Riders but three states have no laws Illinois but what but some states

<timemark seconds="7084" />

women it's only three states we can wear no helmet

<timemark seconds="7089" />

it's Illinois Iowa and New Hampshire Colorado

<timemark seconds="7095" />

maybe it's maybe it's maybe the longest yeah just Google helmet laws in Colorado motorcycle ride motorcycles in Colorado with no helmet

<timemark seconds="7108" />

although how much are proven to save lives in the Colorado however if the motorcycle operator passengers are under 18 they must wear helmet passengers who does under 18 so there is no helmet law if your if your 18 if your 16 laws so what you're saying is three states have no helmet laws that means under 18 / 8 on the matter but won't stay on for that they don't know how is it okay to ride a motorcycle ever and I have to have a seatbelt on a tomato cage

<timemark seconds="7168" />

I should say I love birds so much I love everybody in the competition I just don't like the fact the bird is on these medications that could all his health problems could be completely resolved so much like to take medication so that you can drink that's not good you know I mean I had this conversation a long time ago with Anthony Bourdain who's on statins and he decided to take statins because he like to eat I don't know what that is it's that high blood pressure high cholesterol what it stands for

<timemark seconds="7399" />

obviously he was drinking constantly and he was traveling constantly and he was an exercising cholesterol had some health issues and so they put them on these statins and he start doing Brazilian jiu-jitsu we start doing Brazilian jiu-jitsu he lost a shitload of weight change his diet radically cut back on his drinking and got off of statins and race but statins have like significant health risks attached to them it's not as simple as they just lower your cholesterol they also do a lot of wonky shit do your whole system to your mental I don't know about mental but I know crazy right well he trained with henzo Gracie in New York City right now I know I'm jumping backwards but you mentioned something that now click in my head with the mediator show that your friend us yes do you pronounce I think it was a show I think of the clip I just saw online of him using rendering bear facts

<timemark seconds="7459" />

you should watch that I thought that was fucking amazing cuz he was like I mean I've never I never heard that before that you can you can boil down the bear fat to use oil to cook the rest of the meat yeah cuz he said he was so rich that it was almost like you could fry meat in it he did for me today haven't been using bear fat for ages for lard to cook pies and Tarts to talk about on a podcast recently that he has great podcast as well called mediator same name and on the podcast they were discussing how fat was used during this bear fat this is a particular interesting I'm so because this was all about bears who eat blueberries so all that fat had a purple tone to it a purple shoe to it because the Bears have been there been subsisting on blueberries so they tasted like blueberries

<timemark seconds="7519" />

<timemark seconds="8245" />

why are they so big because this is what they I guess the idea is that the kind of people that are going to buy these are the kind of people that are either addicted to porn or anime porn I would say it's because they don't get anything ever so they have they have any of them any of them and then click on the likes 14 likes Gonzalo they're calling you outside dude why you liking photos of a fake doll that's good job good job is going to get things moving this is what I want to see I want to see that they're just lying there I'm thinking that there's an inanimate

<timemark seconds="8414" />

Steakhouse in this guy of Chicago Blackhawk who I'm a huge fan of comes up to Joe and he's like Joe Rogan Joe Rogan music cool no I mean you're super nice but I was like that's so funny like those guys

<timemark seconds="8445" />

how we treated you was how people treat him do you know what I mean it was wild to watch how people treat athletes when they're like this guy was like he became a kid again who is this restaurant that I fucking love to go to it was it was cool to be on the outside of that the watch that happen cuz I'm such a Chicago Blackhawk like I'm such a sports fan so it's just so weird to watch an athlete kinda act like people acted that do you know I mean it was fucking was just beautiful to watch this podcast Just For Men the podcast is for whoever the fuck likes it but men don't get a whole lot of examples of men that are allowed to just be themselves like that song that girl's sang I really like it and I think she's got really good points and that's saying it so that someone likes me more I'm not I mean I'm saying like maybe as men especially

<timemark seconds="8505" />

is a guy with three daughters you should I should consider and we should all consider what it's like to be a girl you don't have to talk to girls have been drugged of talk to girls have had guys creep on them and do crayfish it to them girls live been sexually assaulted I like that I like that song I Like it not that I like sexual so I meant I like that song

<timemark seconds="8525" />

I like I like this woman expressing herself in an artistic way that represents the real threat that women face and it's also a catchy song she's got a beautiful voice and I'm still a man or doesn't mean that you're you're a loser or that you are you we all know when someone's faking something when they giving in total air pressure and pretending like actress use the word wonderful describe a woman's performance we were talking about why wonder if you know fake shit we know fake shit he has been too much more interesting things come out of this podcast is because

<timemark seconds="8573" />

I don't have it a person telling me what to do and I can just be myself right the people like guys go this is like hanging out this is like what it would be if we were just hanging the people are listening right normal things you don't get to just hang out because when people are listening then he got two tone the language that you can't say things don't don't say that word misconstrued nonsense cuz people allowed to take any opinion that you have you cuz I don't know you're full of pinion in a piece of what you think rip that out and throw that in the fucking space it's recreational outrage a nice little juicy Target like oh let's go after it and it'll be whatever the fuck it is with whoever's next with Ruth Chris Hardwick or whoever whoever gets called out for something and someone whether they're guilty or not it gives a shit let's pile on to that mother fucker and and ruin their life for a couple weeks and this is what's going on this world

<timemark seconds="8633" />

it's it's not good for anybody so I got for men so I could for women there's only one good piece of it at all if you are a piece of shit like Harvey Weinstein if your a fucking turd in your rape women then you're going to get gas and it's good that you got God but even him and you seen the new article that he has a lot of woman who is accusing him of sexual assault there the DEA is talking about throwing it out of out of court because they found the computer log the girls who was accusing Harvey Weinstein one of them of actual sexual so I'll send it to you Jamie so that you can use on the New York Post page six it was on page six yesterday they decided to dismiss it because this woman had a sheet they got a hold of her computer because of her former employer or former employee

<timemark seconds="8693" />

who said look this is not how this girl describe this how I want if I watch the video I don't think so this is a different one this is a girl who gave Harvey Weinstein a blowjob and she said look I'm going to send you the actual thing that I got here Jamie I want to see her former employee was like this is not what she said this is not what she said to me right and they were there were saying that it was in danger of being thrown out and now it is thrown out so she lied about what it was

<timemark seconds="8736" />

so the judge was like fuck that shit they essentially said that this is just she look there are actual sexual assault victims sure and then there are people there's also people I think that are crazy but then I think they don't have a real accurate memory of things that have happened and so they can paint themselves as a victim and be deceptive about it involuntarily I think that's entirely possible I think there's a certain amount of people that are just delusional and they just don't see things accurately did you get that text that I sent you

<timemark seconds="8772" />

but I also still know that Harvey Weinstein is this is a fucking sexual assault dishes too many women that are saying that he forced himself on them that he did things you heard of him with that girl you heard I heard of it I didn't listen to choose Weinstein of forcing her to perform oral sex but a prior employee of Evans turned over personal writing she'd left in the company's computer which appeared to contradict the grand jury testimony while the writing's indicate it was consensual friendly A source told the post it has caused a split them and had to Manhattan District Attorney's Office humbly the charge should be dropped and there's a problem with this complaint and then it was. It was dropped listen it's the whole thing it's hot it's hard man because it's like you don't want to say all these girls are all lying because they're not but one of them could be like

<timemark seconds="8832" />

sure yeah and when one of them is lying they've got to do what they did and throw that case out but then

<timemark seconds="8842" />

well there's people that will be opportunist in the face of a scandal so there's a scandal with someone is actually legitimately done awful things and someone is going to stand up and say he did awful things to me when really they just fuck the guy cuz he wanted Advance if you're right I would I would always argue the majority of people that get involved in this thing probably aren't full of shit there is always going to be people that want to capitalize mental problem but I think there's all that power in that louder the other guy she lied about it up bullets were flying by her and people like kind of no no no

<timemark seconds="8902" />

situation looking people the the exaggerated they make things up and some people are just full of shit and then there's people that are delusional and they have a problem with reality and they might legitimately believe it's something awful happen to them there at there are people that do things like that but she keeps it's not all deceptive just people that have legitimate mental issues and they have paranoid schizophrenia to whatever extent you know whether it's mild or a horrible but they have a delusional perception of the world around them I think people are out to get them out early and then those people get caught up in the middle of selective memory right there's also manipulation of selective memory there's there's there's a lot of study about people that have convinced himself that something happened yet really didn't happen they really believe that is literally what their brain has kind of categorizing formulated was that thing did happen they told himself that enough words than convincing there on mine

<timemark seconds="8962" />

did happen AJ they were saying that OJ is live so many times about what happened that night that he might in his own mind if you didn't do it with a human memory like Neil deGrasse Tyson was trying to explain this to me that when you when you were taught when you're talking about memory you are literally talk about the worst form of evidence that we know of your memory is first of all your memory really is your memory of your memory it's not even your mother it's a member of Yuri counting what you used to remember and then sort of reestablishing it in your Narrative of the past it's a recounting of a thing you tried to recount I'm pretty sure that girl blew me when I was 16 I did have my ears ringing cuz I remember how that's crazy and it's never happened

<timemark seconds="9022" />

she was my note she didn't rape me shim punch you in the face and hit me over the head with a frying pan as far as you know to my ears ring my head went to the shape of a frying pan like those cartoons and then I had to go

<timemark seconds="9049" />

I don't know man it's high time up the Mystic this is what I think about it mean when people talk about the Divide between men and women I don't see it that much in real life and being there with the person talking to the parade so you don't know if things are reasonable you don't know if the people are angry you don't know what the hell that utilize it and is no legitimate station to the internet anymore because it can come from everyone anywhere at anytime and the problem I have with this with with these growth movements I get like crazy as you're like are they talking to anybody else besides their little internal group like are you talking to anybody other than the people that you know because if you're not you're not getting any sort of outside opinion or so you just listening to people that agree with you is so annoying to me at all

<timemark seconds="9109" />

are you are you actually trying to see what the other side is saying I think there are some people that do a good job I don't mention names of likes but there are some people that follow online that like great job of like trying to have good discourse of right and left in

<timemark seconds="9129" />

there are some people that I like online that like to have a good day too fucking balance it out because you don't stick to one way what's here's what it was interesting Bible try I try to be very very balanced but Eileen way more left than way more accused of being someone who favors the right by left people then I do being someone who favors a left by right people would lie espoused left-wing ideas yes like Universal basic income gay rights gay marriage women's rights go down the line welfare food stamps but I get accused way more being a right-wing person by people on the left because to even of being a left-wing person people on the right when I say this because

<timemark seconds="9189" />

you don't you don't complete the problem I have with this but that's my biggest issue with our stretching side of the political party when you don't comply they fucking get mad but get mad but it is a form of fascism there are trying to get you to figure out what they want you to behave like how they want you to talk right they want you to comply with that stick to the script sitting this box Joe or you're not one of us to stick to the groove bitch because we don't do that you don't do that also because I know you fucked turn on each other no one is ever Progressive enough when they run out of targets that if it's a whole world was Progressive they would find people who are less Progressive they were fine people who are not willing to suck that Muslim queer gender

<timemark seconds="9249" />

non-binary I rather sexual whatever whatever that guy's dick is because he's he has a penis or some sort of a homophobe the reason the reason for him for them I can't yeah why the labels just be your your own because people like to be tribal rites but but all that does is that categorizes you and then they get mad a category subjecting yourself I didn't do that you told me you're that.... I don't tell you Joe I'm a white straight male who is Irish and Italian who loves feet and doggy style and that and I'm also kind of Catholic but you know my mom got a divorce so I can't be all the way don't think that applies to a British Iraqi gay non-binary and also identifies as much

<timemark seconds="9309" />

one person I think you're out of your line Lancaster irish-italian straight white male from Chicago to be whoever you fucking want to be and I support the fuck out of who you are always do your shit what's almost always people that don't have a lot of other things going for them identified as a British is identified as a dead right now when he was alive brilliant British physicist / heterosexual atheist who by the way was the Riddler riddle with infidelity I've never met a guy so not capable of cheating and found a way to cheat on his wife still get it up apparently even though his body didn't move is he still could feel things that was used to go to

<timemark seconds="9369" />

wait what he's like yeah he used to go to strip clubs and there's like videos of him like rolling into a strip club in the wheelchair like he would got that was his thing with infidelity that you cheat on his wife all time the whole reason that the whole reason I fell in love with somebody else but he was washing my balls Google if you Google Stephen Hawking he was a feeling that he was always fucking around

<timemark seconds="9406" />

yeah that's a list of the strip clubs

<timemark seconds="9415" />

you know what also is that we like to do you want to leave me why would you only fuck me I'm barely hear his eyes in his fucking in his mouth at some point click he would he would look at something to look at

<timemark seconds="9458" />

can you sit on my face face face don't kill me though now I have to figure out the universe are black holes real or is it just a brown star I don't want to drown in your pussy I'm still on the subject of dark matter I'm trying to figure out the universe before I nut in my pants that's what it that's one of the strippers at even looked up with his called Dark Matter long nails for Bush a pencil because she lives

<timemark seconds="9505" />

<timemark seconds="9803" />

it's weird how things like that happen like top 40 DJ voice very similar to see more of always but that but that's a weird thing to get how did broadcast will cuz when was broadcast journalism College in a teacher that the teacher broadcast voice while I am wkqx 95 9 it's the Moose on the radio this morning Joe Rogan traffic at 9 from Lisa guys today and it's the same Rhythm they all have the exact same cuz it was learned and then they hear other people do it and it just such a monkey here monkey do the Comfort level and imitating it because it's teacher about the rhythm of The Voice

<timemark seconds="9863" />

that's where it all went down they teach you about Riddick ways to lead into the next knees they say it's because the Teachers Pay Teachers The Listener or The Watcher to get to be prepared for the next thing it's almost like a dark matter so far they're not. My chest bullshit give me what you really got to hear people go and then there's a bunch of parody Dark Matter What is this a thing that people do like Jamie was on the phone once getting some tech information from this lady sounds I put her on speaker phone and

<timemark seconds="9923" />

she had the most annoying you know that thing that people do is called Upptalk Upptalk is so annoying Tech talk yes there's a way that they talk they are in Psych a very left-wing technologically savvy way of talking becomes an accent like if it was from Georgia or something like that would be a recognizable accent find Sigler salt pieces Baltimore very recognizable Parsons got that fucking recognizable way of talking to let you know that I'm going to agree with a
