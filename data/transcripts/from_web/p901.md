<timemark seconds="530" />

The Joe Rogan Experience

<timemark seconds="535" />

all day

<timemark seconds="538" />

dr. Rhonda Patrick hello hello back and you got a big fat book of notes over there

<timemark seconds="550" />

it's something I use like before I'm giving a talk or something like that where I like to something about writing handwriting things like helps me remember that I do that before shows if you look at my notebook and you think if you ever thought that I like actually wrote in my notebook you think I'm a crazy person cuz I'm running the same thing over and over again like all work no play makes Jack a Dull Boy it's I just like before asset what I do is I just write out the key things that I wanted to work on and I'll write him out over and over again so I can have a hundred page notebook inside a hundred pages of like half of it the same stop sign over again I'll write out things like that are in more detail and then like you said I like righteous just like a q u know when you're giving a talk at least like in Academia like a PowerPoint talk you have a slide in the slides Q's like a couple of minutes of talk so you've you've got like it helps you remember what you're going to talk about

<timemark seconds="610" />

comedy good idea of a slideshow and I like that would actually be a really good idea I feel like particular points where you could show that you weren't lying like like this is a real thing right where I have to I have to reassure people that I'm not making this up cuz it's so ridiculous you know and like one of them was this woman who proposed as a high-school student she was a 25 year old police officer super attractive and she posed as a high-school student and convinced a young boy to sell her marijuana and then the rest of them

<timemark seconds="651" />

so it wasn't just an experiment was a sting operation wow he was a regular kid he was an honor roll Kid and now he's a felon that is a crazy guy falls in love with undercover cop in marijuana sting gets arrested says one of them I would love to be able to put that up and go see I'm not cuz you could I guess you just make stuff up if you wanted to let you know how do chameleons do they make stuff I mean yeah I guess you're right people like comedians usually make up personal stories sometimes they say it's true and I'm like it's so outrageous is really true like I don't know because it's just so funny you know some of the story is it that some of these comedians tell when I'm sick how can this be true they said it was true but it's like

<timemark seconds="711" />

he's a true story was hey how about you just make something up it's funny and I liked it doesn't have to be true buddy right I bet you're likely hope so that helps me like so this this helps in a writing it down helps me but also there's the running

<timemark seconds="744" />

running like helps so actually this was very interesting cuz the study just came out not long ago showing that if you so if you run before you're going to learn something and you want to like let's say you want to like you know do something short-term recall so you're going to go up on stage and say something and if they ask it whatever and if you run right before that it improves the short-term like memory so your short-term recall if you run right before whatever it is you're quickly read over something and then you don't remember it but if you are learning something and then you run after you learn it and then like the next day you want to remember it so tomorrow longer-term is that so it's like whether or not you're running before after you learn it affects the short-term versus long-term memory Bazaar it wasn't like they were catching for that I just found out through cuz they were just doing running before after they're probably looking at just to see how it affects short and long-term memory recall and their works

<timemark seconds="804" />

price to find out this is a study that was done I can't remember where it was done and I tweeted about it not long ago cuz it was like within this last month that it came out so you know it's like if you want to if you want to feel like while I'm you know learning new material throughout the day and then I go for a run in the evening and then the next day I'll be able to recall it better to radically now I'm subject to the placebo effect I know about this I'm like a ride that's a problem yeah I don't run normally but I did a 5k on Monday like I don't run at all but a buddy of mine had a 5K race in Vegas so I flew in for him and my friend Cameron Hanes and I ran it and it was surprisingly hard it was like with all the working out I do about 23 miles hope it's like 3.1 or something it's not easy yeah I know it's so do you do any like aerobic yes

<timemark seconds="864" />

successful at getting there I got there last week 3 times a week but I don't run so I figured I'll be fine food in train at all you just kind of like on the Fly just did this 5K and I saw I saw you post something about this and isn't doesn't Cameron is any like some kind of like crazy Runner Lordsburg he's preparing right now for the Moab race which is 235 or 20 34 miles something crazy like that Jamie that's incredible I mean he did 205 last year did the Bigfoot 200 which is 205 miles plus it has something insane like 55,000 feet of elevation change over the course of the entire race cuz you're constantly going up and down and up and down

<timemark seconds="918" />

and it's some point in the race it's so Steep and the treatments an outdoor race over Mount Saint Helens saying sometimes the terrain is so brutal that the top speed is 2 miles an hour he's going to be like one of those like amazing super agers like like like that just very mentally sharp when he's in when he's older either that or not going to be part of being a super Ager like being physically fit your mentally sharp and mentally sharp is this really the key thing you know cuz we start losing 20 and by the time if you can actually make it to a hundred years old you lose like 20% of your brain that so low they found that one of the keys to like maintaining your brain mass is pushed past. Comfortable Zone physically so but you know exercise wise and also mentally just you know obviously like

<timemark seconds="978" />

yourself so you know so when you're working out you don't do this kind of like you know how fast things and that seems to be key for becoming a Super Ager those crazy that it works with your brain while I exercise I mean exercise has profound effects on your brain I mean specifically for looking at you know Robuck aerobic exercise it's hard as a as you said doing a 5k running 3 miles I mean you do you do a lot of training and yet that was still hard for you you know because that type of aerobic exercise is difficult Studies have shown that even just like 20 or 30 minutes of aerobic exercise can healthy young man increase serum bdnf brain-derived neurotrophic Factor this is a growth factor that is involved in growing a new brain cells and in allowing the existing brain cells to survive so you know talking about combating brain after for your

<timemark seconds="1038" />

about commenting that the fact that your brain is not referring starting at the age of 20 that's the way to do it and it's really frightening 20 you started your new pussycat 20 it was so stupid at 20 I'm so much smarter than I was when I was 20 I agree I agree I mean it's not necessarily brain mass and intelligence I mean I don't know if you know that it's like when you start losing mass in your hippocampus and that's part of the brain but there's just so many studies showing that exercise exercise and also you know it doesn't have to be right back you can do resistance training that sort of stuff also affects the brain as well for me like I've been a run or since

<timemark seconds="1088" />

high school track I guess long a long time and for me and I've done like a few races I've been a marathon and I don't feel like marathons are my thing like I felt like that was just really rough I mean I'll run 3 miles and and I will spill challenge like if I mean to push myself I can do that. I feel like doing that a couple times three times a week is plenty for me but when I run you know for me it's my I entered this like state of of light daydreaming sort of I get creative you know what I'm going on like a 3-mile run I'm just I start thinking about things if I have an important decision to make or something that's causing me some sort of anxiety I go for a run and I feel like I can address that issue better and what's interesting is that there have been studies that have shown that going for a run and specifically aerobic exercise it activates the

<timemark seconds="1148" />

your brain bought an executive function which helps you make decisions you know it's it's kind of like that overarching part of your brain that like helps with all the planning long-term planning all that so I always I do I feel like if I go for runs and it's bothering me from chest and I always feel better 100% of the time like there's not a single time that I go for a run and I'm like damn I feel worse than I do that crap on doing it this is why I feel like the human mind I mean this is all just theoretical in my own theories I think the human mind is designed to confront serious things like like Predators you know the dangerous enemies in and we don't really get much of that in this life so when a person is dealing with stress I think the mind is preparing for some things that don't exist so even if you could work things out logically there Still Remains effective reward systems that are kind of in place of a time we really did have

<timemark seconds="1208" />

have all those that those reactions in place to deal with you no dangerous Invaders or being all the horrible natural conditions know whatever they would be that we hardly ever experienced any more so like when I workout if I have anything is bothering me or troubling me I just think I get like a distorted perception of the danger of it or the physical react like it could be something real simple like I have an issue at work that I have to deal with like maybe I have to make a decision or maybe you know I'm stressed about something and I feel this no matter how much I Work It Out logically I still feel this physical like residual issue and that issue only seems to be resolved for me cuz I don't run with hitting the bag like for me it's a punching bag like it's which is really hard to do like when you when you do rounds like kickboxing rounds in a bag I have a timer and I can set it for 3 to 5 minutes

<timemark seconds="1268" />

actually it'll all the way down to one and then it has like intervals so it gives me like 30 seconds every 30 seconds to go off and has two lights one light is yellow and one light is blue and so the yellow light I kind of a go at like 60 70% and then the blue light is Sprint so it's like Sprint try to catch your breath Sprint try to catch bats and I do that for seven or eight rounds and when I do that I don't give a fuck about anything after it's open mic who cares it's amazing what it does cuz like my mind still has all the same data I still understand all whatever it is like a work-related nonsense I still understand all the issues about it and they're all there's no new information but now the information is coming in my brain and it's going to all this isn't a foreign Invader Vikings that are coming over in a swinging swords this is just some nonsense whatever it is you know

<timemark seconds="1328" />

urgent issue or manager issue tax issue or whatever the fuck it is that seems so physically daunting before the exercise then afterwards when that aspect of the problem is alleviated that that's stress it's almost like Mike our bodies are just like confused as to what these problems actually are like I love I love your your interpretation this cuz it's exactly the way that I would like to talk about why we need this type of stress I actually just like you said I actually think that from an evolutionary like evolutionary perspective that we were meant to be stressed we were meant we were meant to be outside either hunting tilling the land for food you know to prepare food out by UVB radiation which is stressful we were designed to you no have stress and what I mean by designed was we have genetic switches which are supposed to be

<timemark seconds="1388" />

turn on these genetic switches that are activated by stress are supposed to be turned on and just like you said we're in the building novel time now where we don't have to go outside we don't have to till the land we don't have to hunt for our food which incident we can sit on the couch on a butt all day and order delivery or go to the grocery store and we don't have to eat foods with polyphenols are flavonoids are things that are also slightly stressful so this is kind of that concept of hormesis but it's it's I like the way you explained it because I really agree with you I think that humans were meant to be stressed exercise is a form of that stress and there's different various different types of that stress and I and I think that we were supposed to switch on those those genetic switches those jeans that are helping us deal with stress or like you know like you said you have a problem and I I'm the same way with my run I'll have some something that's bothering me I have to deal with whatever it is and I mean

<timemark seconds="1448" />

mind blow it up it may not even be that big of a deal but I go for a run

<timemark seconds="1454" />

with no new information with nothing new you know like I feel better and I think that's partly because I'm switching on all these you note stress response pathway is it help me deal with the stress better is anti inflammatory Pathways just all this for a really good genetic switches that are being switched on so when it's only make sense I think this new time that we live in I just don't necessarily understand that body understands where the stress is coming from I think your body is a physical organism and nature is an absolutely brutal thing and it has been for us as well for all these other animals forever but now for us it's not anymore and so all these mechanisms are in place to protect you and they don't get served and for me martial arts is always been like the best one to deal with it is good to like a good Kettlebell workout does it too but like the big ones for me are Jiu-Jitsu and kickboxing because jiu jitsu

<timemark seconds="1514" />

is really really hard to do and it's also you are solving problems so I think Jiu-Jitsu serve two purposes it's incredibly grueling as far as like the sparring process of just rolling and you know I'm competing with each other even in a friendly roll like with a guy that I really like and we're laughing and we slap hands you know every time someone gets tapped out or whatever it's so difficult like your your your body is taxed so hard and your mind is taxed because you're dealing with countering you're dealing with setting up move you're dealing with your stinking several steps ahead and then you're you're adjusting those thoughts based on whatever this person that you're sparring with his doing too so people get addicted to for all the right reasons and want to think that I found is that Jiu-Jitsu people like for the most part our way more mellow than most people would expect like way more chill about stuff like whale

<timemark seconds="1574" />

most likely to respond to something in a Dom or an imbalance way because they whatever your body whatever these requirements are that we're addressing your body has all that in Jiu-Jitsu but without the real real violence you know I mean like don't try to kill you that they're just trying to do this thing to you and you're trying to do that thing to them and those things mimic actual combat actual real life and death struggle in a friendly and it also its has this camaraderie built into it too because you kind of understand that you're going through this incredibly intense thing together and you also understand that it takes a unique person to go through that and and get past all these psychological hurdles all these physiological hurdles and then you also are aware that this person understands like really clearly the kinship that you all share in having this experience together

<timemark seconds="1633" />

find a relay I mean not to the same degree like what you're what you're describing is on a whole other level but I experienced something similar when I'm when I'm out surfing you know it's I'm getting the physical exercise but I'm also like a tackling these fears of these big waves and getting pulled under and drowning and getting tangled with my cord and every time I do it I always have that fear paddling out there but I get out there this group of surfers and we're all sitting out there and there is a sort of friendship that we develop out there cuz we all love surfing and we've all Lake we know we know it's like oh here comes the way where you know helping each other like look there's one on the outside had allowed you know so it's kind of like completely like a different level from what you're describing with that Jiu-Jitsu but still I kind of can relate a little bit you know I don't know if it is a different level two people surf as well I think there's like a similar tracks into it

<timemark seconds="1693" />

also you're a monster Dodger like you're out there in the Monster Soup that's what that is it's crazy that I still have many years that I would get over that fear but my friend Shane Dorian Surfer and he's been on a podcast for and he's a big-time bowhunter too and we talk all the time about this and you know I'm the way he describes it is just it's so attractive like I want to try it but there's not enough hours in the day for me there's not I get to addicted to things and I have a fucking real fear of sharks it's real sharks are scary scary but they're real they're out about Jesus what is this Jamie

<timemark seconds="1753" />

totally he's a legit Maniac wow like that is what is how high would you say that wave is it's got to be 50 feet right hell yeah oh my God look at the size of that is so insane I had so insane what is a my God so insane that's more than 50 feet right I would say a very pink of it what it comes down on you is it that if that if you got smushed like if you fell and that came down on you when you hear you're probably fucked right that's the fear yeah I mean when the biggest wave ever surfed is like

<timemark seconds="1805" />

overhead you know it's like over time and a half overheads are not even double overhead so and that was like I had a couple of scary moments where I was just tumbling during donuts and I couldn't find which way was up or down I was surfing now in this place called Sunset Cliffs and it's really hard to jump out window unit for the wave breaks and then paddle out and is always kelp beds and I was surfing at is one time this was back when I was really dumb and didn't wear a leash because I was like wishes you know I like to dance on my board and they get in my way and so I didn't really but I so it was like to have this moment when you panic and that's really bad like panicking when you're like in the water cause Panic takes like your energy and and I panicked

<timemark seconds="1865" />

I was cuz I thought it was going to die so I'll probably moments that you never traumatizing in the way how long does it take to get out of help I don't remember because it was just I think the panics would have I just lost track it seems like forever to me like I don't know how long it actually took and of course I lost my board and women and I got caught up on the reef actually stick to a beach breaks now but I don't like you said I don't even get to Surf that much anymore because I just don't you just can't wipe out if you wipe out you're going to go right into all that jaggesh it depends on where the reef is like like I was

<timemark seconds="1925" />

as you can it's it's dangerous 3rd beginner should not ever go out on a reef and I've seen many beginners out there but it's yeah it's Jeff to hit your head pretty pretty brutal but the only sharks I've actually actually I shouldn't say that's not that's not actually accurate I don't have any scary shark encounters I served for a long time in La Jolla and there's a breeding ground there for leopard sharks which are not to be confused with tiger sharks leopard sharks are the ones that have like the spots on them and they're really harmless they're kind of like nurse sharks and they're really cool look at but I've never had I've never actually known anyone that serves in Southern California that is enough with all the Surfers that I've known that has had an encounter in Southern California with a

<timemark seconds="1985" />

do you know people that have encountered them in the Bay Area are the sharks the bad neighborhood somewhere I guess it's just in my convince myself that video of a drone flying over Malibu where some guy takes a drone and he's flying over the Malibu Surf and he's like the Drone is like maybe a few hundred yards away from some Surfers and you see a big fucking great white just swimming along just swimming along show me this video and

<timemark seconds="2045" />

on further and further out you see this fucking Whopper shark that's not far away from these people own nothing just Melvin just a shark right there before what the fuck did you know you're a smart woman you understand the Monster Soup I try not to think about the shark Surfer and two sharks no big deal yeah that's pretty scary it supposed to be scary just apparently Catalina that whole area outside of Catalina is a crazy shark fishing Mecca where I have a friend of mine from taxes and he traveled to Catalina Island and he said it is the most Savage stretch of water and all North America he said

<timemark seconds="2105" />

infested with mako sharks and they got there to catch mako sharks with a delicious mako sharks are really really good to eat too they taste like swordfish that taste amazing thing about sharks now it's because people are so silly because of the awareness of shark fin soup you know because shark fin soup is that the practice of acquiring shark fins is really brutal and not sustainable at all it's really horrific and a lot of Asian Fisheries engage in these unsustainable practices were they scooped up thousands and thousands of sharks cut their fins off and then throw them right back in the water so they waste most of the shark in order to get the fins for shark fin soup and some because they're trying to raise awareness of this now people are getting really upset at anyone who catches sharks even if they catch sharks legally for food because sharks are not in danger

<timemark seconds="2165" />

and is what is anymore in any more sense than tuna is in danger because tuna are in vastly diminished numbers than they were just a few decades ago if you talk to anyone who's a commercial fisherman or even a sport fishing like these guys that run these charter boats they'll tell you like to use to catch way more tuna a used to be way more prevalent is that the commercial fishing is just brutalizing the tune of money but yet everybody still eat tuna twice about it because this campaign against the shark fin soup is made people are really upset at people that catch sharks to eat even people that eat meat it's like we're so simplistic and like are protesting and like people just have it in their head that I heard that you're not supposed to eat sharks anymore I can you catch and sharks you fucking asshole like like that is the one thing that you know I mean if you really want to talk about like fish that don't do no harm to human beings like sharks aren't on that list

<timemark seconds="2225" />

the scary goddamn animals you can eat. Kudos kudos to you don't they have higher mercury levels like swordfish like I would not eat swordfish really hell no no yea there is like wish I could remember the amount it's something like a hundred 50 micrograms per like 4 oz or something so compare that to Wild Atlantic salmon which has like four micrograms yeah swordfish so the ones that are really safe to eat that I know of the wild link of salmon wild Alaskan

white tuna is okay but the albacore tuna has a little bit more Mercury I think it's like you know twice as much or something but I'm old I'm a little thinking that Vino shark would be high on the Mercury level does interesting by let's find that out cuz I know that people have had issues that eat a tremendous amount of sushi people that eat sushi like every day I know they have had issues with Mercury in the past we had an arsenic issue with sardines cuz sardines are bottom dwellers and I used to eat sardines all the time I have like I love sorry yeah I love starting to can sardines too much I got some blood work done and the doctor was like you have some significant amounts of arsenic in your system I'm like my being poisoned he's like no not not that because it's not like someone's trying to kill you but it is like a dietary issue and they asked me what I ate and I said you know went through all my food is like nothing else I got he was worried about Seafood

<timemark seconds="2333" />

Seafood a lot of sardines you like that's it I'm late arsenic right side makes sense so I backed off I didn't eat sardines at all for three months came back the issues completely resolved you know what you sweat out a lot of these heavy metals like Mercury arsenic garlic some of the beta mercaptans and garlic has a key lately Barn chelate Mercury and help Pull It in like excreted out of your body through urine so like when I whenever I make salmon or fish which I actually do need a lot of stamina probably need it like two or three times a week I always have fresh garlic with it that's amazing is outstanding too because it's so hot for you exactly yeah it's really high in omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA so and it's got a modest amount of vitamin D cloves of garlic I'll just break it down two points

<timemark seconds="2393" />

makes me feel horrible I'll have like a big glass of Kombucha and I'll take like a lump of garlic and I'll break off like 4-5 close and I'll just take off the skin and chew those bitches down and chug it with kombucha it's off like sometimes it fits painful like because he's like my system is like what in the fuck is this like I could feel it inside my body burning love it I've done the same thing previously I mean I don't do that anymore but compounds in it so that makes perfect sense to take a knee

<timemark seconds="2436" />

yeah like I didn't actually go down it but what I did was I put both my arms on the counter and I went down

<timemark seconds="2446" />

cuz it was just burning going down I just was like wow this is probably not even working I'm just being retarded and getting back to some of those like pungent compounds that are in these plants I mean that kind of gets back to what we were talking about a minute ago with switching on those genetic switches that are meant to be switched on their men were supposed to eat these kinds of foods garlic you know broccoli cauliflower kale these things that have that pungent mustard you know that that pungent taste these things are various different polyphenols in compounds and one in particular I become obsessed with lately is sulforaphane and that's present in most of the cruciferous family like kale broccoli cabbage brussel sprouts Wasabi vegetables

<timemark seconds="2506" />

that is it's actually sulforaphane to not in the plant that gets formed once you break the plant tissue once it's like chewed or crushed or Blended or whatever chop somehow because it's stored as a precursor and then once the tissue get spino chapter or whatever then it forms sulforaphane and that's part of its need for medic response its plant response to try to ward off an insect's or whatever thing so that's that's why it forms but it actually when we ingest it it's really really really good for us you know so the sulforaphane in particular which is actually really really high and broccoli Sprouts have you ever had broccoli Sprouts contain like a hundred times more of it than mature broccoli probably the best source of sulforaphane dietary source of sulforaphane out there that I saw your Instagram

<timemark seconds="2566" />

do you make shakes with that right I do yeah I feel sort of convinced that it's a very powerful anti-aging and also powerful

<timemark seconds="2579" />

nootropic in a way I guess I could say and I can elaborate but you know so I've been doing these shakes where you can you can Sprout you can get a spot your own Sprouts at home for a relatively cheap you just buy some Organics are you believe it or not though if you freeze them so I was actually I'm freezer supposed bags are going in the freezer when you freeze them because when you freeze the plant that issue also gets like broken in actually doubles in some cases you can up to double the amount of sulforaphane because it like has a longer time to form this so you can sell more concentrated with wood Hardware, just because it's so powerful that if you make a shake with it and you're doing like At first I was doing fresh shakes and then we start freezing

<timemark seconds="2639" />

and I was making shakes hour from previously frozen sprouts and it's like I needed like half the dose you not to feel to feel the same thing or a tragedy

<timemark seconds="2650" />

okay so I guess I should probably you know it's kind of just like

<timemark seconds="2656" />

like when you drink coffee you know how you kind of just to feel a little happy and good and you feel a little more alert for like that and it's it's it's been shown so there have been clinical studies in humans and this is very interesting because it's been shown like if you give it you give you know even just a small and I think it was like between 7 to 30 mg of sulforaphane a day to two young adults with autism

<timemark seconds="2689" />

the improved their autistic scores by like 34% and artistic scores they liked it there's a range of different you know test that are done till like measure different various brain functions would improve this and then she autistic you know you have cystic individuals by like 34% the same was done in a pilot study for people with schizophrenia wear it like improve their there's something so they're just functions better yeah so and this is like pretty the results were so powerful that this was done at Johns Hopkins the said he's not being repeated we not because it's like this is what is going on here like how is affecting the brain and I think you know if you look a lot of the animal studies there's a lots and lots of animal studies that have been done which are enough people aren't quite as can cuz it's like well how much of this relates to humans but it's been shown to be as effective as the antidepressant Prozac in the leading depression in mice and they do all these battery of

<timemark seconds="2749" />

that's what they like stressing myself and make them depressed and social defeat in like the hanging by their tail it's actually just kind of gnarly but and then a bunch of tests they do to see if they're depressed and you give them you know your your Placebo you give him Prozac or give him the the broccoli sprout extract and it performed just as well I'm so it helps depression has been shown to help with neurogenic diseases all sorts of things but the point is I think that the reason it's actually affecting all these brain functions and why even you know someone like me May notice a small effect from from eating them is because it has very profound effect on inflammation and that is because as I mentioned it's it switches on one of those switches that was meant to be switched on that's why I called and talked to in our body that controls over 200 jeans and sulforaphane is the most potent naturally occurring compound that we've discovered yet that activates this pathway so it's no

<timemark seconds="2809" />

air plant compound other naturally occurring plant compound can I activate this pathway as potent as sulfur friend and enter of to be involved in delaying aging and a lot of that happens through flooring tons of different genes activating anti-inflammatory lowering oxidative stress all the enzymes that helps with detoxifying compounds that were exposed to on a daily basis like carcinogens and things so I think that we're having a low level of this like inflammation stuff that we're constantly you know so if you're if you get a dose of this you may notice a small effect now it's someone that has autism or schizophrenia inflammation and oxidative stress have been shown in previous studies I'm all previous studies to play a role in in the etiology of those diseases so I think that's how it may be affecting the brain but it's not just affecting the brain probably one of the most well-known

<timemark seconds="2871" />

functions of sulfur Fame is that it's like a very powerful not a cancer preventive compound so it's you know it's been shown to prevent cancer. For example if you had prostate cancer when they were given 60 mg of sulforaphane a day for think it was like a month I don't exactly how long but it lowered its load the doubling rate of a biomarker called prostate specific antigen PSA which is what is usually measured when men have prostate cancer you imagine the progression of it cuz it has a doubling rate it doubles every so often but it's load that doubling rate by 86% which is pretty pretty profound courses lots and lots of associative Studies have shown cruciferous vegetables you know she eat more of them you have lower risk of bladder ovarian prostate kidneys all sorts of cancers but there's the clinical trials I think her what's really telling because they're you know you're giving someone this compound and

<timemark seconds="2931" />

flooring a tumor progression marker by 86% this another study which is really interesting also and this is kind of like really got me interested in other people are interested in it you know we're exposed to tube compounds from like air pollution so I can living in Los Angeles for example is probably definitely one of the places that you're going to be more exposed to that system is Airborne a carcinogen so benzene's one of them acrolein these things are in the air we're breathing a man we're getting to some degree we having a Benzene in our system and it is a carcinogen it's been shown to cause cancer specifically linked to leukemia is smokers get a ton of it because it's in it's in cigarettes since cigarette smokers are like really loaded up with venting but there was a study where people were given like 40 mg of this sulforaphane in the form of a broccoli sprout drink a day

<timemark seconds="2991" />

for like a week and starting on day one of drinking this drink they excreted 61% of the Benzene like on day one 61% of benzene which is coming out of their urine like as you measure and tablets and I was like wow that is amazing like getting rid of some of that stuff you know I know cuz I'm definitely want to get rid of the Banting and all that stuff that I'm being exposed to so that really got my attention to because it was just so significant and a profound of a fact just after one day so that that was another sort of thing that got me really into it and then the Aging stuff where you know it's been shown some inflammation has been identified as a teenager of Aging taking sulfur Fang has been shown to lower inflammatory markers in people by like 20% C-reactive protein other inflammatory markers course she's like dozens of studies and animals that have been done but I swear I think the human studies are more interesting to talk about so deathly more relevant

<timemark seconds="3050" />

and then also it's been shown to affect cardiovascular health because of the inflammation I think so type 2 diabetics that were given some some days I think it was something around 45 sulforaphane they were given this daily and for a month for 4 weeks and it lowered their triglycerides by 20% it lower their atherogenic index which is like measuring you know that the dangerous type of LDL small dense LDL triglycerides looking at all these things that lower that by 50% and prove their blood sugar by like almost 20% so that's like I'm getting my mom she she definitely has got like high triglycerides you know that's just shown at it like delays aging so I'm convinced that I think it's one of those things like you get it in kale and I think that I've been getting a good dose of it

<timemark seconds="3106" />

I've been drinking kale smoothies pretty regularly since probably like 2010

<timemark seconds="3114" />

yeah. 6 7 years and I do feel like it's like help page like help me age like a little better I mean it could be completely in my mind but just as healthy but I think that I found something to take it to another level where I think that I'm pretty convinced that if I continue taking the sulforaphane I think it will absolutely affect the way I ate and I think my brain I mean it's been shown that recent animal said he has to affect brain traumatic brain injury and 50% you just all sorts of Nines It just like I could go on I have a video ideas like a 45-minute video where I'm literally just talking about for 45 minutes and then I went on yeah and I I did this this research took many months and it's like a 16-page article I wrote I hope to get published I think I'm going to submit it for publication because it's just a bit

<timemark seconds="3174" />

a lot of work and I haven't seen anything in a literature as comprehensive covering every base like I just I tried to cover everything that was like a good study you know that was important and so and then I flew out to Johns Hopkins on recently I was invited to give a talk there and I met just so happens to a guy who discovered that first of all the guy who discovered sulforaphane is there but he's much older I didn't meet with I'm at with someone who trained with him who discovered that broccoli Sprouts are the best source of sulfur and so he made that Discovery back in the 90s and I interviewed him and she just went on and on and on and talked about so far refrained like in addition to like what I had already talked about on this one the videos I did and he actually had some really interesting stuff to talk about in terms of like you know you so in order to get to sulforaphane you have to the plant has to be crushed or chopped and that's because it has an enzyme in it called myrosinase and myrosinase is

<timemark seconds="3234" />

heat-sensitive so when you when you when you steam your broccoli when you boil your kale when you saw that stuff unfortunately you're in activating myrosinase and so you're not getting as much sulforaphane you're getting dramatically less dramatic almost almost non-existent the precursor glucoraphanin is still in that plant so you're getting a precursor and we do have some bacteria some types of bifidobacterium forgot that contain myrosinase enzyme highly variable from Individual to individual but so you can convert some of that to sulforaphane but was interesting that he mentioned is you can actually sprinkle mustard powder like mustard powder and You by after you saute your tail or after you steam your vegetables or what if you cook if you apply heat to any of your cruciferous vegetables afterwards you put the muscle Padawan mustard powder it has active

<timemark seconds="3294" />

pretty the Moroccan is in the mustard seed is more heat stable so so you could you can actually convert your you know precursor into the sulforaphane by take that is a really great cuz I do cook a lot of the time so is there any people are there any compounds in KL that or broccoli more bioavailable minerals and stuff in it like magnesium to calcium those things are those things become more bioavailable when you cook them and you said you would get that benefit plus if you just cooked it right at the mustard to write when the Mustard Seed powder you have to make sure it's like what I like to do is sprinkle a little bit of my hand and lick lick it like it's got to give that have to have that bite if it doesn't have the buy it's like it's been to

<timemark seconds="3354" />

turn on the shelf for too long it's been an Amazon shelves for two on whatever you know so yeah you have to have that light mustard bite to it Mustard Seed The Mustard Seed yeah so that so that was a very useful because the sulforaphane it's really good job I really am I'm trying to like get people to I think the more people that get to Sulphur Fanta Wi-Fi thing going to be healthier and then get can help prevent cancer lower inflammation I'm just so many different good thing so smokers for God sake of your smoker are they should be taking sulfur if it should be drinking those shakes after drinking drinking like someone get broccoli Sprouts where where would you get that well so the thing is is that you can brought you can buy broccoli Sprouts already sprouted at like Whole Food

<timemark seconds="3414" />

Twitter Sprouts or whatever your local you know grocery store is most most of grocery stores can I have broccoli sprouts and broccoli Sprouts is there at Whole Foods are at Sprouts but the problem here's the problem with Vine Sprouts they're very prone to to Brett real contamination the Cookie Co light like the longer they sit on the Shelf a lot of times when you go into these grocery stores they're sitting on the shelf and so they're probably likely little more contaminated with e-coli than if you were to sprout them yourself and get them fresh so you can buy them but I think and they also charge like this like five bucks for like a little like package of it you know it's like

<timemark seconds="3472" />

and so how do you grow it has lots of different methods you can you can use hemp like so previously we used to do these hemp hemp bags were we just put the seas in the back and you add some water basically just keep adding water to them about it and they sprout with in like 4 days then we start doing this jar method we're now we have mason jars with a lid on top that has like little holes that are big enough for water to come out obviously but not for the seeds to come out and so you know you get these jars and you add water let it sit for like 6 hours and then dump it out and then just after that you continually just add water and dump it out now the water to put out an Intel leave it tilted so that the water isn't just like you don't want the water just sitting in there so that it's like growing bacteria and stuff so you know till the water she just wanted what is that what you really just takes like 4 days and it and then you have sprouts

<timemark seconds="3532" />

all the dishware using sturdy and then you're probably going to contaminate them so you have to like be a little too serious about the way you sprout these things you know but I think once you're aware of that then it's okay the other thing is I'm in this is something that I'm going to talk to to the expert his name is a dr. Jed Fahey I recently interviewed for my podcast he mentioned something to me that I caught my interest he said the seed itself the broccoli seed itself has the enzyme that has the precursor to sulforaphane and if you break her crush the seed or to the Sea then you're actually getting sulforaphane so you can actually crush up the seed in like a coffee grinder or something and like to take a shot of it but the thing is is there has been no research doing that to all these studies that I just talked about in humans those were all done from like broccoli sprout powder extract from the Sprouts powder extract

<timemark seconds="3590" />

great question on so well the power extracts were mostly made by researchers in fact Jed Jed is supplied a lot of a lot of different universities with the with the extract himself but the Arts supplement wise that's the other thing that he really sort of illuminated for me because because he's actually been measuring this certain supplements that are on the market and like if they actually have what they say they have and so because Marcin is is so unstable it is hard to make a supplement sulforaphane there is one supplement only one that I know of that actually has sulforaphane the actual Act of compound and that's called prostafine and that's only available in France by the way I have no affiliation with any of these like supplement companies at all I'm just coming information it's only available in France it's only available in France and so and that's so he actually tested that one and people that were given prostafine the bioavailability

<timemark seconds="3650" />

note to self Roofing the 70% so 70% of it ended up liking their bloodstream there's another supplement called avmacol avmacol has glucoraphanin + myrosin is so doesn't have the sulfur if it has the two compounds that can form so for a fan but hasn't together that has been tested and that was about 40% by a5th about 40% of it was that you're actually getting sulforaphane 40% of the time and that was also tested there's another supplement and that is available in the US does another supplement by Thorne Call. Kucera I think and Coursera only has the precursor no enzyme so you're totally relying on your gut bacteria and some people it's very variable so that only has like a 10% bioavailability other than that meant that he really could you just published recently that he got behind I asked

<timemark seconds="3710" />

cuz I'd actually been taking us another one called broccoli Max by jarrow and he kind of is like asking about it he was kind of like some of what it says in there but not all in the problem is is that these supplements I mean there's a lot of a lot of the time like he was telling me like jeez like 7 out of 10 x e supplements had like Clover Leaf in them when they're supposed to have like the cruciferous Nino precursor glucoraphanin so it's just like it's kind of disgusting how supplement company possibly have supplement companies are you know totally just putting all this Cloverleaf and whatever and there was a study that came out a couple years ago on this like like 75% of all these like herbal echinacea like all these you know compounds that are Amino Amino marketed for whatever. Actually may contain echinacea or whatever they say they contain it's really it's really kind of bad

<timemark seconds="3770" />

you are a company that sells that stuff A lot of times you're not even you're not even getting it now they're buying it from companies that Supply to them and a lot of times these companies are in China and places where there regulations are not that strict where we would get stuff tested we get batches tested in the batches of different individual ingredients without stuff in it that they weren't supposed to have in it just because they're mixing it all up in the same bins that's true that

<timemark seconds="3807" />

yeah I mean there's just you got to find a reliable brand I think you know Soren Soren seems to be a pretty reliable one that I've seen in multiple multiple different times were scientist or like yeah we tested at it it's more expensive but they seem to be pretty reliable and seems like very cost-effective to correctly it's cost-effective you don't you don't have to have extra cash to buy all these expensive supplements cuz all the ones I just mentioned that actually are effective and have what they say they're not cheap so that you had in that Instagram photo is that all Sprouts you'd made yourself

<timemark seconds="3855" />

I mean they get really dense to fill up inside the jar jar is but I'm thinking I might just do a quick spreading like a five or six minute like I'm already going in my head about how I'm going to start sprouting awesome but they're good on salads I mean you know you sprinkle them on anything when we got home that have holes already in them we're at the old lights we were using which is better lives that have even smaller holes because some of the seeds were getting out of this but this came as a kit a sprouting kit you can buy on Amazon that has like a little wooden

<timemark seconds="3915" />

I think it's at the mason jars and so they're like tilted and you can like drinking a drink the water out they came with those ways but then we did some experimentation and found other lives that are superior to those how much maintenance is involved in making a noise like how often do you have to tend to these things so it's like it's like twice a day dump water on them about 5 days I think for five days so I'm home for a stretch so I was just trying to like a maximized I want more but you can actually you could have Harvest Harvest it was probably like early like 3 days 3 and 1/2 days and actually the longer you wait the more you have to be

<timemark seconds="3975" />

what contamination to so it's like it's better probably even to Harbison sooner freeze them so they're like you know no bacteria or safe storage bags vacuum seal things and freeze him know I should not do that with me to do now that's that's really intense stop the other question I wanted to have to talk to you about was when you were saying schizophrenia and how Sophie rafain can prevent or somehow I mitigate the fat of the effects of schizophrenia do you think that there is a possible correlation between a lot of these mental health diseases and a lack of proper nutrition oh absolutely I think that I lack of proper nutrition is a huge component of a lot of mental diseases and psychological diseases in general in fact

<timemark seconds="4035" />

inflammation is now it's really been identified as

<timemark seconds="4041" />

I causing a cause a role in depression not something that you know so it with the depression thing It's Kind of a Funny Story and it's not that funny it's actually kind of eye-opening but back in the use of the CDC has like estimated that about 11% of Americans are on it some sort of antidepressant 11% Salat so here's the story behind that it is and I know several people that are on the motor have taken them you know you know whatever but the story behind that is kind of interesting because you back in like the early 70s a lot of these clinical trials are being done on antidepressants with people that had depression and at that time people that had depression that were involved in these trials were people that were severely depressed and hospitalized so they were so depressed that they had been Hospital

<timemark seconds="4100" />

depression I don't know many people that nowadays but so they were hospitalized for depression and then they were given either a placebo or a depressant and a multiple trials you know FDA have reviewed these trials 70% of the time the antidepressants are the antidepressant worked in 70% of the patients compared to 30% of the patients purple Steve or right 70% pretty good if you're comparing that to 30% Placebo was like well that's applications that seems to work right

<timemark seconds="4132" />

what then happened after those trials were done starting in the 70s in like 80s is that the clinical diagnostic manual to call the DSM at that time it was the DSM to they changed all their their diagnosis you know markers and and symptoms for depression and they expanded it a great great deal and then called depression major depressive disorder so it became the sort of like broader you know disease quote on quote where it was like it's not trust these people that are severely hospitalized it's people that are feeling depressed and anxious and sad what unit is basically you're you're getting a bigger group of people which is probably a great opportunity for for a pharmaceutical company then when clinical trials were repeated on this new population of people so these These are clinical trials that we're done from like the 80s

<timemark seconds="4192" />

all the way up until like the 2000 year 2000 reviewed by the FDA what was found was quite shocking and that was that only 40% of people are not responding to light and depressants ssris other man norepinephrine reuptake Inhibitors also whatever the standard of care is compared to 30% Placebo so now you're talkin about only 10 performing a 10% better than Placebo it's like okay something is so clearly it's not that the antidepressants don't ever work it's just that we are now over prescribing them to people that you know I have this major depressive disorder and they're not working on people that weren't that the initial group of people that were like severely depressed and hospitalized you know so it's like

<timemark seconds="4242" />

okay that's that's a big problem because they're I mean they're prescribed like I mean I just

<timemark seconds="4251" />

like I can't even believe it you know I just have so many personal stories people I know you know that have gone you know what they're going through some crisis and personal whatever giving you some crazy and they change the personality the person and I'm just like please get off of this like you know it's not like I'm ever work it's just that you know I think once the clinical diagnostic procedure for diagnosing depression became major depressive order disorder all of a sudden you're getting people that are not like having just you know whatever stressful event in their life that's making them a little depressed the time which everyone's probably experience are now being you know given this antidepressant when they don't really need it and there are effects that are not good with taking somebody's you know a depressant so there was a big effect on libido libido

<timemark seconds="4311" />

is actually a gene that numb a gene polymorphism variation in a gene that that is linked to that so people that have it have it even more severe effect where they really don't they really have like sexual dysfunction in response to yeah yeah it doesn't happen to everyone quite as much but there there's a percentage of people that are really really affects and there's lots of other things I'm changing your brain chemistry is not exact it's not an exact science had gone to several doctors and they prescribed a bunch of different things to him and he was severely depressed and eventually they gave up and he had to find a much better doctor that his care is whatever his insurance package would not pay for and once you found that doctor then the doctor was just more knowledgeable about what would you know potential

<timemark seconds="4367" />

different ones now know how many different ones are are but they got him on something that actually worked he's off at now took him a while and then you know eventually got happy and then I'll be enough

<timemark seconds="4379" />

which is an interesting thing to accept people always want to connect depression they want to say depression is a disease and they want to say it almost like oh you got herpes like you know what I mean it's like what you've got depression all you need medicine and for him one of the big factors in fixing everything was his own success his own personal success and then he became more happy and then his the medication helped he became more successful and then as he became eventually really successful he started to experience like a better quality of life he was happier he was more confident and then he slowly wean himself off and now he has no need for them to me that is so fascinating because so we're not talking about necessarily a disease like he does not have cancer it's not that they cured him of a disease it's it was a blanket that was keeping him warm you know it was something that was was allowing him to bridge the gap between an unhealthy mental state

<timemark seconds="4439" />

and a healthy mental state but a lot of that Health had to do with his own life he still eats like shitt I mean he's not like the healthiest God he thought fucking candy but he's really healthy now as far as like his mind is very happy he's not lying you know he's not faking it so to me it's always I mean when you know I've talked to friends that have had a really good results with antidepressant so I think there are some dark moments in people's lives where that can kind of get them out of that but then part of me doesn't buy that that's the way to go cuz part of me is like okay did you exercise know did you take like really healthy foods know did you clean your life up know did you eat what happened here and one of the things that a lot of these antidepressants do not feel bad about stuff like about anything like I had a friend was on Zoloft and she said like she took it for a year and she's like I lost a year

<timemark seconds="4499" />

why it's like I didn't give a fuck about anything during that year I like anything can happen but not giving a bad you also you don't feel great either you don't feel like you don't feel like God is a good time to be alive but skinny I'm healthy I can move all those thoughts don't sort of coming to to play It's like a doll's everything it dulls the highs and adult the lows and keep the pain away interesting because believe it or not that's actually a symptom of depression I think it's called like for Downey or something. Like really respond to anything it's like you can't like you just can't like or like make them super anxious I that is kind of like you know so that's actually kind of interesting that she was experiencing that while on an antidepressant will the results very pretty wives totally yeah I mean with the same drugs

<timemark seconds="4559" />

diversity like what what's causing that that you like you could take something and you would have a totally different reaction and I could take something and you know it would just be perfect I don't think we actually know really why that is but what we do know is that there are a mean there are different we are different people and I've got different genes that are regulating how much serotonin and I'm making how much dopamine I'm making how much I metabolism how quickly I metabolizing it then you and other people and so when you like and Pippin end this is this absolutely does affect how some of these drugs are you know when they're taken how how they're with their biological effect is now you know why why I don't know you know I'm so it's if there's definitely like it a genetic variation that that affect where are neurotransmitters are being fired away in the way they're being metabolized and so if you're if you're adding a drug that's changing the way something's being metabolized already then

<timemark seconds="4619" />

yes can affect people differently I think I know that's one reason but honestly I don't know who knows just maybe like other you know life situations as well as other territory situations all these things probably Play Your Role you know what the inflammation I was talking about actual playing a cause a role I mean they're bad actually been studies wear normal healthy people are injected with either a placebo which is say water in saltwater or they're injected with something that are gut produce is called an endotoxin or gut produces it when are immune cells in our gut attack the bacteria in your gut because endotoxin is actually a component of the bacterial cell membrane and that is released upon information so when you're eating a terrible diet lots of refined sugar that's been shown really standard toxin causes inflammatory response so when people are injected with endotoxin or they're injected with pro-inflammatory cytokines like interferon-gamma which we also making our body when were inflamed

<timemark seconds="4679" />

people start to it normal healthy people start to experience feelings of depression they start to feel depressed anxious social withdrawal people with Placebo did not experience. I'm also they had elevated levels of other inflammatory biomarkers in their blood so it really like and this is just misses causal and we're talking about injecting its completion information office and they're experiencing he's like depressive symptoms he was actually on people that were then given one of the omega-3 fatty acids EPA there the next day of pretty high dose of it I think we're supposed to like two grand for Something Completely alleviated any of those symptoms of inflammatory cytokine or the endotoxin EPA did not experience the symptoms of inflammation you know driven these symptoms that were not experienced in the placebo so that's kind of understand multiple studies showing this is multiple studies

<timemark seconds="4739" />

multiple studies again this is kind of like a new method people are using to explore how inflammation affects depression it also has been shown the same sort of scenario where there's a placebo and they're injecting an inflammatory cytokine dopamine levels lower in the brains of people that were injected with the the pro-inflammatory cytokine but not the same water and also the reward pathway in the brain is also decreased like I was mentioning you're not you're not that excitable you don't you know it's kind of like and that and that was not that's not happen in the Pacific group so this was not just an effect of being shot up with something you know so I have look at some some of the mechanisms and explored how is it that inflammation is affecting dopamine in the brain how is it that it's in affecting people's mood it's thought now there's a variety of mechanisms one is that you know these inflammatory cytokines they actually cross the blood-brain barrier to get into the brain and they disrupt dopamine release they disrupt

<timemark seconds="4799" />

norepinephrine releasing another disrupting these neurotransmitters being released on the other way connected to the brain to the meninges that was like cut off the brain was protected from the lymphatic system but it turns out we were wrong and everything they're going to text books for years and years in our science classes was not accurate actually we are lymphatic system is Captain what that means is that are immune system the chemicals that are inflammatory cytokines were producing you know from our immune cells are getting into the brain and disrupting you know neurotransmitter release and other things so there's obviously a really strong connection to inflammation depression is shown to be causal but when you think about it it's like well what causes inflammation I can we can talk about the sugar sub because that's that's been shown eating a terrible diet does but other thing that causes it and it

<timemark seconds="4859" />

what you be mentioned that is a stressful event in someone's life an emotional event you know a break up a tragedy work-related stress social anxiety whatever it is anything that causes you to release cortisol stress hormones believe it or not those things actually affect inflammation in your gut so it's like a two-way street here I think that previously you and I have talked about and other podcasts like how gut microbiome bacteria you know you can take microbiome bacteria from anxious Mouse and transplanted into a non anxious Mouse and getting dressed and vice-versa right so there's like some sort of gut-brain axis through with something called the vagal nerve will it goes both ways you can go from the brain down to the gut so it's been shown that like cortical releasing hormone which is the stress hormone do you know when you release it goes and it activates immune cells which then activate

<timemark seconds="4919" />

proteins in the guy that shoe up to call Pro Diaz's that you have the gut barrier and then you start to release more influence which then like get in contact with bacteria more inflammation in the back it's like this feedback loop so I think that's how stress also part of the mechanism a stressful event to break up or tragedy of things also cause inflammation they cause inflammation in fact is a totally up topic but that's one reason why people should never go in like get like blood work done like like a day or two after some kind of like traumatic event cuz it'll be good fire don't get your blood or whatever cuz they will like it will skew everything everything that's that's so amazing and Gwen discuss this and when you lay all these facts out it makes it seem so irresponsible to 10% of the people are on business

<timemark seconds="4979" />

11% scuse me or on this drug or ass it was Cena whatever up a category of these drugs instead of dealing with it I mean it seems like

<timemark seconds="4990" />

it's it's weird a weird place when it comes to the holistic treatment of the human body are very weird place where we have all this information now but it doesn't seem like it's being applied when it comes to the average person who is suffering the average person who is dealing with a disease or depression which I guess you could call it disease

<timemark seconds="5012" />

and it just seems so insane that with all we know that we're treating it only with his chemical pathway we're only treated with a pilled Pharmacy you know this farmer logical solution to this which de seems so limited you know I think the problem is multi-fold do you know one is that you have seen a psychiatrist and and they're trained to certain way and people when their patients come in they expect that they're going to come because they want a pill they do they come in because they don't want to deal with it and they want a pill and so you know it's that's kind of a problem because they need enough people need to understand that these pills are not the Magic Bullet and I just told you only 40% of people are responding to these antidepressants or standard of care compared to 30% a respond to Placebo a sugar pill like that is ridiculous

<timemark seconds="5072" />

I think I would love if there was some way to get a deposition of usually go psychiatrist people go to for these sorts of problems to like push someone to say you have to go run you know you're going to run 6 miles a week you're going to run you're going to do that that is going to help you like you know it's in fact it's been shown it's been set aside exercise helps improve depression in one of the ways a does it very interesting ly is that aerobic exercise specifically has been shown that whole serotonin pathway were talking about inflammation inhibiting release of Serotonin will guess what an inflammation affect serotonin and another way the precursor to serotonin and tryptophan when you have inflammation so like I said emotional event causes inflammation doesn't have to be your sugar diet okay without you know inflammation can be caused by your cortisol released when you have inflammation in your body

<timemark seconds="5132" />

it's a fight off something but that's what it thinks it's like okay this I'm sick I've got four Invader I need to kill it and so the tryptophan which usually is being transported into brain to make serotonin which plays a role in how you feel it plays a role in lots of brain functions then gets diverted into another pathway because your body is converted into this whole other pathway called can urinating which helps with immune cells need it to ourselves needed to make different types of immune cells so your body is like okay if I need more but the problem is that the kind of learning and gets converted into so now what you have is right there that's the first thing so if you're not sick if your chronic inflammation chronically stressed Chronicle eating a terrible diet then you are going to constantly be diverting the serotonin you know the tryptophan is other pathway you going to be to clean your brain and serotonin

<timemark seconds="5192" />

right so that's one thing but this is a two-fold problem then that whole kind you're anything gets converted into something called quinolinic acid which actually crosses over the blood-brain barrier becomes a neurotoxin and also has been shown to cause depression that's not supposed to be there and exercise has been shown specifically aerobic exercise causes for muscle to soak up the conjuring actual another precursor to it but can't form Clinic acid so doesn't form the the neurotoxin Park part but you know exercise also cost you to make to make strip and go into your brain you know at Levy add some of the competition with branched chain amino acids like losing a nice it was in so that's another way it's doing a million things we talked about the beginning the podcast that also plays a role in depression helping prevent depression yes owner of Genesis all that stuff that helps your brain cells making new connections helps helps you deal with stress

<timemark seconds="5252" />

that's why you make it when you stress your body it seems like there could be some sort of a Halo holistic approach like a clinic that looks at all of these factors looks at all these factors and prescribes instead of just prescribed pill prescribed a very specific diet and exercise routine and maybe even meditation maybe even something that the practices are or enhances mindfulness for promotes mindfulness something that allows you to manage the way you are viewing and taking in scenarios and end scenes and an event in your life and then processing them in a more healthy manner it seems like all these things would be as effective or maybe more effective than just a pill I agree with you and I'm hopeful for the future I think that the more there's a lot of scientist is better studying this now I mean it's becoming very common to to look in the scientific literature and and see you know scientists researching inflammation and the role of inflammation depression

<timemark seconds="5312" />

and the role of exercise in helping treated and the role of other you know dietary myself actors and causing in treating depression so I think that you know I really am hopeful that in the near future that like you said it's going to be a multi-pronged approach where it's not just a magic pill and I'm not saying that's not also going to be included in something you know I'm just saying you know it's I think I think the diet lifestyle meditation exercise if we could just get that into like you know that the clinical world and if people were motivated enough to realize this will really help them like it really well

<timemark seconds="5352" />

people be so much happier I really do I really think so so I'm people just don't want to fucking exercise it's weird they would so much rather go to a doctor and get a pill it's it's so strange it's a whole lot of people well it's this fear of discomfort people have this extreme feeling in their mind when it comes to their associations with exercise they want to avoid discomfort they feel like any type of exercise is just like something to be avoided that's not for me fuck that I don't want to sweat I don't want to strain and a lot of times this Association that they have is about the beginnings of getting in shape it's not about once you're actually fit because once you're actually fit exercises something you look forward to its and alleviate that stress it's it feels great like if I can't get a workout in all I look at my schedule and gouache it on time for work out which means I'm not going to get that good feeling and so instead of looking at it like oh I've got to go Grunt and sweat

<timemark seconds="5410" />

I'm thinking I'm not going to feel good I'm not going to feel relaxed I'm not going to feel carefree and I'm not going to feel even appreciative like my appreciation of things and it gets enhance greatly after exercise I just feel better I feel like I can take things in for what they are rather than you know what whatever the weather over sensor data that I'm getting from any event is just one more distraction that gets in my way and in all that that's a lot of times how I look at things if I'm over stressed or from working too much because that's exactly what I thought you said that exercise does what you're talkin about is that executive function you're talkin about feeling good without that sensory stuff which is the amygdala to emotional Center that's been shown to be decreased in an activity after exercise where is the executive function is increased so it's it's it's just it done is exactly the right direction right you sell your think about this

<timemark seconds="5470" />

sensory response that like gut feel is much that that part of your brains actually quieter after exercise meditation does a similar thing but if there was just a way to get this knowledge to eat for people to understand people that are averse to exercising you know if there was just some way and I'm really trying to find a way because there are many people that I care about in my life that are that way and that feel depressed and or on some sort of you know and depressing which doesn't really work for them still and so I'm trying to find the way I look like I can tell them I'm having this conversation with you and you get it because you experience it you exercise you do you know you you eat healthy you experienced these things but for someone that's never experienced that communicated to be so hard for people to start anything new it's it's it's hard for people to start a pottery class that's not going to you know it's not going to be

<timemark seconds="5530" />

any physical pain or any stress or exhaustion there's not there's not that feeling that you get when you're really tired you know or the feeling that you got for me it's particularly difficult doing boring stuff like an elliptical machine like elliptical machine to me it's a great workout it's awesome if I'm at a gym cuz if I go to a gym like at a hotel and you know they have some bullshit weights and but they have an elliptical machine I go okay if this thing has a high setting I can get a real work out in this but those times when you're tired and you don't want to do it there so fucking beur it just you have to listen to something you have to watch something like other stimuli has to come in in order to get you pumped up but I know this cuz I've done it a thousand times for someone who hasn't done it a thousand times you did get to that point like Fuck this I'm out of here all my God let me get a donut and I'll give me a call if I don't go outside and smoke a cigarette I feel better

<timemark seconds="5590" />

you know and it's so hard to get past that because we have all these Connections in our mind when it comes to comfort comfort and stress Comfort Inn like our bodies for whatever reason most people there so see a shins are to avoid anything that's uncomfortable but it's so illogical because when you look at comfort and you look at success in progress and eventual the feelings of accomplishment and getting past certain hurdles and interns like how you feel about life a lot of those are connected to discomfort like discomfort is your friend it really is like discomfort and not being happy and content with certain situations in life are certain feelings in life there are massive massive motivators and they're amazing at episode hitting change and yet our instinct is to avoid tolls and just sit on the couch

<timemark seconds="5650" />

and watch some fucking reality show about due to make moonshine with our job open let it sit with bizarre it's too much too much of that likes ya get that sensory information the need to act like you need to actually go out there and act as is so strong it's such as it such an important thing but yet we resisted many people I know you don't I don't but so many people do I but I feel the thing you know I don't I don't allow it to work but I feel that fuck this I want to workout before I workout I did have at least an inclination to blow it off I don't ever embrace it but it's there to there with everybody like no one is like completely 100% healthy and without any resistance being a super Ager I wonder if there is some Association there were looking at we're looking at

<timemark seconds="5710" />

it's important to push bass pass that uncomfortableness weather is physical or mental and that's linked to being a super Ager but what if it's just like the ability to make yourself do that is important to write it's not just the act that you're doing as much as the strenuous exercise which it is obviously good we know that it's good from science but what if it's just being able to like push yourself like maybe some people don't have that ability for whatever reason or they just haven't tapped into it enough because I'm really experienced I think it's a good thing you know because if I take time off like I got sick recently and I couldn't work out for like a week or mail six days or so and the act of getting back into the gym I think a lot of ways we rely on momentum we rely on the momentum of past experiences where you're just conditioned to do that it's one of the things that you do and for me at least when I get to it when I get like

<timemark seconds="5770" />

really disciplined and really consistent with my workouts one of things that I feel I almost feel momentum I feel like there's like a push behind me like all right we're waiting on you after I get out of the gym I have a really good work out of my check and now I'm doing it I'm doing it all the time now and I'm looking forward to the next time and it makes that resistance much weaker and it makes my motivation in my discipline much stronger I think a lot of it is based on just the consistency and that's one of things I talked about Ricci on the podcast I said you know like blowing something off it's not just not good like blowing off an exercise that you planned is not just bad for you physically it's also bad mentally because then that option is now available the option to fuck off is available and you did it before and you probably going to do it again and you'll get mediocre results not just in that aspect of your life but maybe in all aspects of your life cuz I think that

<timemark seconds="5830" />

option to fuck off when you embrace it that is a pathway that you might choose when it comes to dealing with conflict in your personal life dealing with business decisions dealing with career decisions like an uncomfortable decision that you might be faced with or maybe you need to make a change as far as like what your pathway is in life but you don't do it instead you fuck off and that the inclination to fuck off I think that gathers momentum is well the inclination to be disciplined that comes with momentum too and I think both things like you did you take a path the path of the healthy person are the path of the fuck off like both of them are available and whichever path you Embrace totally totally I mean I think that's the same thing goes for like line to I mean I think it's very bad to lie like even if it's something that is really benign like what they call it a little tiny white look great.

<timemark seconds="5890" />

directions in your brain and and you start to like it used to doing it like you were saying and and I think that it just kind of dawned on me as you were saying this that with the motivation in the momentum you're talking about I think that's the same way I think you're like building these neural Pathways he's motivation Pathways and and that's really important for that momentum but do it again and again you know there's been there was some Studies have been done work you can take a person and do that direct transcranial stimulation which I don't know much about it but I remember these studies and like stimulate a certain part of the brain that involve the motivation you can motivate them to go to the gym so you motivate them to actually go work out so that's a specific area of the outside of your head and then there is like a little 9 volt battery is attached to it and it just zaps you a little bit specifically with this study I was talking about it actually is a couple of them were and

<timemark seconds="5950" />

the motivation and that's probably with you and I we already have those Pathways activated because we're constantly forcing our self to go I mean I feel the same way there are times I'm like I don't want to go for a run once you do a goddamn you feel great great and you know what you've accomplished something so it's not only like you're feeling great from all the neural mechanisms are being activate and all the biochemistry that's going on but you've accomplished something you did you pushed past me you didn't want to do when you feel good about doing that after magnetic stimulation therapy Wilmington woman finds motivation and energy yeah there's a Radiolab about this Radiolab podcast called 9 volt Nirvana and it's a pretty good stores amazing because it deals with this woman who went to this like sniper training simulation video video of thing that they do it where they they put you in

<timemark seconds="6010" />

I want to give you a fake gun and they put you in front of a video screen and a scenario plays out and in the scenario there's like a terrorist attack you have to take out the bad guys and they did it with her and she was schitt's 20 minutes long and she was terrible so she fucked it all up is just like a disaster like she didn't respond correctly then they put these electrodes would you exactly call them one of those things that I can select rows so they put these on her brain and is on the outside of her head in very specific areas and stimulated it and then recreated it and in the re-creation she was 100% effective she killed all the bad guys and she went through this 20 minute thing and when it was over when they told her that it was over she thought they were fucking with her cuz she thought it was only 2 minutes like two yeah like everything is incredible. Amazing describes it is amazing it's amazing it's a little scary

<timemark seconds="6068" />

just because of me so I can do like program someone to do something there's another study that was that was upheld which like 2 years ago same thing transcranial direct stimulation and I would like I'm surrounded around me that's why I just remember this study because it was trying to investigate what part of the brain is Fault in Consciousness right and so she is so that the study was designed in such a way where she was reading a book anime zap turn a certain part of the brain and she stopped reading the book this woman and like just look at them like a zombie like no nothing no talk no enemies after again and she started right she picked up right where she left off have no recollection at all so anyways I was a little scared that is a real concern right because one of the things about this transcranial direct stimulation Radiolab podcast

<timemark seconds="6128" />

was that they talked about how many people are out there to fucking experimenting where there is a whole Community online where people are talking about like experimenting with the voltages experimenting with the placement and one guy did something is lost his sense of taste like the bus consequences of a world where anyone with $20 and access to Radio Shack and make their own brain zapper yeah that is that from Radiolab from there because apparently this gigantic community of it like the last couple years itd tdcs transdirect cranial stimulation has been all over these researchers claim that juicing the brain with just to milliamps 9 volt think 9 volt battery battery can help with everything from learning languages to quitting smoking to overcome

<timemark seconds="6188" />

depression and so are they brought in a neuroscientist Michael weissend at Wright State research institute in the studio tell them how it works really interesting in terms of like treating depression or helping people get motivated to go to the gym it may really have relevance to blow the fuck an engine on a thing you know what's going on I'm thinking about going to radio shop Radio Shack right after I get out of here not really but sort of I mean it's just interesting it's it's it's amazing that we are really some sort of a system and you can choose that system like a little electricity here a little there a little

<timemark seconds="6248" />

things about people is how variable we are depending upon what we put inside of us and we don't think of it that way most of time we think of ourselves as ourselves you know I'm sure you think of yourself as Rhonda Patrick but Rhonda Patrick realizing a bunch of fucking chemicals to be Rhonda Patrick Ryan I mean there's a lot of stuff going on in there it's not just it's not this one like this is all laptop you know I'm a shit this thing like this is everything in place and electricity plugs in the back it's not really variable you know what that the human body so fucking variable and pliable and malleable there's so many different things that you can do to make yourself better I got his conversation with a friend of mine who is not a physical fitness guy and he's kind of a nihilist in nihilistic I never say that word is read it

<timemark seconds="6308" />

little bit of a curmudgeon and he's like yeah what's the point you know it's really what it what it what is the point you're always doing all this martial arts and exercise I get if I could give you a pill and that pill would turn you essentially into a super person like you can do share that you can't do now you could lift weights you can't what lifts you could beat people up you could do physical fitness fits Feats that you know what you right now are totally insurmountable and outside the realm of possibility would you take that pill so salt so simple and he goes no I wouldn't I go you wouldn't okay if I could give you a pill that would prevent you from being a decaying old man and you can stay in the state you are right now would you take that he's like yeah I probably would take that I go with that's how it feels like to me motherfuker like that's how it feels like to be a single man he's not much I think he's a year older than me but he looks like he's 50 years old

<timemark seconds="6368" />

doesn't have any muscle tone and I'm like dude all that is just physical fitness like you're not broken like there's nothing wrong with you but if you got on like a steady yoga routine and started doing some resistance training and a completely different body my whole life so that I can do to stop that you don't think is possible and to me it's like two times a week 3 times a week I do that stuff like this is not your body is like a race car that you can juice up yourself you can add the fat tires you can add the improve suspension you can beef up the horsepower in the engine could do all that yourself or you can just choose to have this shity body that's always falling apart right I mean you and I are both choosing to do as you know we're both kind of obsessed with the nutrition and aging and you know as as optimal as we can

<timemark seconds="6428" />

house but ultimately what we are doing is delaying the aging process by switching on all the switches and liking of exercise and getting all the micronutrients and avoiding the refined sugar which is causing inflammation and all that stuff and it's really because that stuff is part of the aging process and it accelerates the aging process you know where I don't think people that don't do this stuff realize that it's like it's not just about looking good about aging it's about like being older and being fit and being mentally sharp and not being mean a degenerate into rapid and how I mean how awful would that be to be like 60 which is young men 60 is still young and to be like you know. Yeah broken it's super, specially for sedentary people most people are people that also choose to eat terrible diet looks like they're also eating crappy food and

<timemark seconds="6488" />

getting all the nutrients Mega explosion Dynamite bad I think he connects vanity with those things and he thinks vanities for fools and I-80 thinks it's a it's a it's a trait that he finds reprehensible he just doesn't like it and I sees people that are you know whatever maybe it's flashy clothes maybe it's you know the way they wear their hair whatever it is he thinks it's Preposterous he connects that with physical fitness like man but it's your vehicle it's like how you get through this life and it's it's how you think it's it's it's so many different things that are all connected into one superorganism which is the life that you're living it's you know I wouldn't I think everybody knows now I mean it's not something we grew up knowing but everybody knows now about your gut biome sza

<timemark seconds="6548" />

huge factor in how you exist as an organism or as it mean even even an organism is the wrong word cuz we're essentially ecosystems you know when we're we're in charge this weird Consciousness that has all this resistance and has all this inclination towards comfort and fucking off and blowing things off is what is in charge of making all these things happen that keep is ecosystem healthy it's almost like if Earth itself had like a shity manager you know if like there was a manager of her a natural manager of Earth that was like a god who cares if it rains ohgod do you know like let's let you know I'm going to stop growing things I don't give a shit anymore it's all stupid anyway I mean it's literally like that just blow it up fuck it was just kill all the lights on only last seven billion years and see that

<timemark seconds="6608" />

it's like well you're going to die you're going to age can't stop aging and it's like yes you're right but that's not the point the point is to age better like that's the point the point is to increase your help span you know and that is we know is possible like that can there's something there somebody's like centenarians and supercentenarians I've seen that are like over a hundred years old and I like riding bikes in racing and it's like they're all these other people that don't exercise feel they physically feel their own body diminishing and they just feel it's inevitable it's just what it is what it is you're wasting your time you're out there running around but we're not because this experience right now it's not like no one's under the illusion you're going to live forever but you are enhancing the experience of your currently involved in right now and you are alive you are alive you do experience is life

<timemark seconds="6668" />

do you experience life optimally is it is it as enjoyable as it can be and we all know there's a spectrum for that enjoyability like we've all had times in our life works not been so great and then X analyze everything came together like what a fucking great day will make more of those but you can make more of those and then the whole things better and I think when that whole thing is better it affects everybody everybody it's around you everybody come in contact with and that in turn made it sound so grandiose but in an intern can affect the entire race of human beings and I love the way you put it about like the feeling good it's not just about you know stating all cancer you know it's not just about what's going to happen 20 30 years from now it's about now it's about not being depressed we know that you know it's about feeling better it's about being smart about having more executive function having more long-term planning less emotional amygdala

<timemark seconds="6728" />

right here right now that is happening that is so you know it's not just long-term effects but you also are you know also affecting which is very good so it's like a win-win you're not just affecting the future you're fighting right now how you feel how you perform you know it's yeah it's an important concept that I continue to try to get you know across to people and it also will optimize everything else you do creative Pursuits whether it's relationships that you get into a lot of those things are predicated on what how you feel as you enter them how you feel when you participate in them and you can enhance that you can enhance that and there's a weird thing that people do what they want to pretend they're not trying to do better you know I'm fine everything's great like it's not that's not true you putting out effort it's a matter of you you have a mindset or you have a connection in your brain with putting out more effort and connecting that to discomfort

<timemark seconds="6786" />

and that connecting things to discomfort if you ever Steven pressfield has a book called The War of art brought up in this podcast a million times have a copy of it I'll give it to you afterwards cuz I become I bought like 50 copies of it I hand it right handed out to people's great and he's been on this podcast before and hits a book is essentially mostly about the creative Pursuit and it's about resistance that people feel when you know you should write or you know you should paint or whatever you said sculpt whatever these things are that you you pursue and that there's this thing that comes up that tries to keep you from doing that this resistance and he's like this is a battle that you will fight for the rest of your life but the key is to fight it not to give in don't give in to that resistance to fight just to fight that resistance and in doing so every day you do so you have won the battle for that day and you will continue to fight that battle and if you continue the fight that battle that same mindset you will win and this the guy that like up until the time he was 40 years old

<timemark seconds="6846" />

is basically a loser he wasn't doing well he's like a failed writer and then he kind of just figured it out and got a shit together and then wrote books about it now he's like a really accomplished author and it's a it's an amazing story he's a really cool guy to I had it on for a podcast and you know it in his enthusiasm and the way he approaches it in this book is like it's a very pragmatic like you can see the steps and he lays it all out in a way that's very easy to digest awesome yeah I'd love to read it mean I think that's something that's very important part of of of The Human Experience is pushing past that resistance to want to do it you get better at it next time 2 minutes till they're about you you do get better next time there's also a problem I think that what it comes up when you and I are doing is podcast with her so much data there is so much

<timemark seconds="6906" />

taken I mean we have done how many podcast now it's six or seven and every one of them is 3 hours of like what in a fuck how does she know all this and just notebooks like that when I put it up on Twitter you know that you're going to be here every response in the comments I like to learn about things that can make me better things that can make out of people better mentally physically healthy aging and all that is so I'll share that with with people I have you heard of this we're talking about an aging pill and it kind of came into my mind we were talking about giving your friend that if you could take a pill the way the way you age or make you live you no longer better have you heard of like nicotinamide riboside or nicotinamide mononucleotide not at all not at all

<timemark seconds="6966" />

maybe it's not made its way into the popular music video as much as I thought but it's definitely blown up in the science so there's a nucleotides are there like precursor forms to vitamin B3 and in the body they get converted into something called and a D & N D is something that you absolutely have to your mitochondria which make energy have to have to make energy like you can't oxidized fat fatty acids you can talk space glucose you can't make energy from any of the food you eat without a needy because your mitochondria and need to make the energy so it's very important for your mitochondria function to make energy but also it's very important it's like the levels of NAD always rise like when your fasting between meals so between breakfast and lunch or breakfast and dinner or whatever your energy levels go up like slowly after a meal and during the fasting State and also when you exercise

<timemark seconds="7026" />

but these are precursors to NAD go back to this for me n e d n e d is something that decreases with age it's something that you know it's just it's very important for aging anytime your inflamed all the energy gets sucked because your energy to be no energy requires energy to like have your immune cells be activated in fighting off whatever they think they're fighting off whether or not it's refined sugar or actual infection but which sucks it up so it's like it's basically a limiting factor in a lot of ways so this been all these studies over the past

<timemark seconds="7072" />

I don't know I'd say like 6 years probably now five or six years where various scientists are have been feeding mice my driver side or nicotinamide mononucleotide and they're finding that you know for example if you feed them nicotinamide mononucleotide delays Aging in their liver in their bones in their eyes their muscle there so it's basically like their tissues or aging better they are they have enhanced endurance they have a better mitochondrial function and these are doses like human equivalent dose to like 24 ml mg per kilogram body weight per day which could be a lot if you weigh a lot but showing a function and nicotinamide riboside which gets converted into nicotinamide mononucleotide it's kind of confusing and it just lots of studies on that showing that it like if you give it to my said have some sort of mitochondrial defect in their muscles all atropine completely

<timemark seconds="7132" />

verses that their muscles are like they're making lots of mitochondria and their improves muscle function and enhance performance anyway it's like you get the idea I like lots and lots of animal studies recently there's been a human clinical trial done with nicotinamide riboside and not just to show that safe and that it actually does increase NAD levels in in human blood which it does even even as well as a hundred milligram dose a day that's found in like broccoli broccoli cucumbers are really high and it cabbage is fine in edamame but I decide which gets converted into that which eventually makes its way to NAD is it is a supplement so a few scientists actually some big-name scientist in the Aging field at Lennox warranty and a couple of others have started a supplement company called Alicia

<timemark seconds="7192" />

give me that pad I forgot to put a pad over here I got to write that down thank u e l y s i u m i don't have any I think it's a company called the company called leasing where's the supplement at the supplement called Elysium but how do you spell the actual nicotinamide how do you say nickel-o t i n a m i d

<timemark seconds="7235" />

right beside riboside yeah so it's also there's another company I think Thorn makes makes one with it and its thorn thorn the thing that's interesting about the Elysium though that I found because I started looking into this like I've met Lennox warranty he's a guy who who Who's pathway that was very relaxed onto discovered that an act so empty switch is on this whole like genetic pathway that's like anti aging and it just changes all these epigenetic factors okay I'm getting into all the details in like boring people to death it's like it actor it it's basically NAD levels rise attacks of the switch this Rises NAD levels so this is a supplement that's Rising energy level what's interesting about the elyssium is that it has something in it called pterostilbene pterostilbene is found in blueberries blue-berries

<timemark seconds="7293" />

but what I so interesting I was trying to figure out Mike why are they putting try to figure out why they're putting pterostilbene with nicotinamide riboside because nicotinamide riboside is affecting nadu's affecting mitochondrial biogenesis which has been shown to increase mitochondrial biogenesis like I said these mice mice you never were were performing like 42% better at different endurance activities after being supplemented with us so yeah it's like the 32-24-32 mg per kilogram body weight would be the human equivalent oh so you know that's a lot that's probably like four grams a day or something like that right for like a hundred and sixty or 80 lb person something like that I don't know anyways the pterostilbene is interesting because well in itself is interesting because it's actually it's chemically similar to Resveratrol

<timemark seconds="7346" />

and but it's four times more bioavailable than the spiritual and it actually has been compared side-by-side in Mouse studies to like two different house that is edible that cognitive function and it's better at improving cognitive function in animals been research all is largely because it's four times more bioavailable so anyways I don't know if that's why they're doing it because it's not affecting the same pathway but then I came across something really interesting in that is pterostilbene actually has been shown again this is an animal study to increase a type of bacteria in the gut that causes the conversion of certain compounds Elijah tannins which are found in berries and some nights but really high ladder tannins get converted into something call Terrell still I mean called an a by your gut bacteria which is what pterostilbene is increasing that gut bacteria to pterostilbene

<timemark seconds="7406" />

increasing the production of your lip and a from berries they're having set of compound you're living a with that does is this is been shown also in other cities its causes my Taffy mitophagy for my top Ajit which is the clearing away of damaged mitochondria so you're basically clearing away damaged mitochondria like to eat themselves Sophie would be eating soft kind of like autophagy or etapa G is called which is a cell sword of a damaged soul that gets cleared away eats itself that happens a lot during a fasting state will this mitophagy is doing it specifically for mitochondria and this the reason why this is so cool

<timemark seconds="7446" />

but I'm going to try to like not bore you can go on and the reason this is so cool is because so you know mitochondria are very important for the way the age it's not just muscle function brain function to Fred and energy for everything. Like your mother finds a DK DK that's the way it is like. So there mitochondria as you were damaged and all this stuff will they have this hole repair system where you where you have lots of mitochondria and that one's self listen to have one damaged mitochondria one healthy but they do is they fuse together exchange all content and Fizz back apart so they're kind of like repair each other's you have a healthy want a damaged one healthy one kind of mixes with the unhealthy one and we have two healthy-ish one's right so this happening constantly inside every cell if you are what you looking at mitochondria it's never like you never see the mitochondria by themselves are always like like a network like they look like vermicelli spaghetti because they're constantly doing this well if you

<timemark seconds="7506" />

clear away the damaged ones and you increase mitochondrial biogenesis with a nicotine my right beside it's not only are you getting rid of damaged pool you're now creating new ones that are like brand new healthy young like you had when you were a young person so now you're good in and of itself because you're making me mitochondria but having damaged one still around cancel dilute the pull-out you know it's can still with that would clear ones and you're making new ones it's kind of like you're going to get like young new to call Andrea so

<timemark seconds="7546" />

I think that possibly is another reason why they combine those I mean it's completely speculation I'm just but anyways you learned some cool shit about tariffs explained exercise to some degree can increase it fasting does and you try to do to conserve some of your energy and the way you do that is by eating different organelles eating eating the cell itself which can then provide energy for other cells so you so usually what happens is fasting will selectively get rid of some of those damaged cells are damaged mitochondria so that that happens during during a fasting State doesn't make sense for the damaged ones before he has lots of like molecular mechanisms of membrane potentials like

<timemark seconds="7606" />

it's just it's all this complicated stuff but it's like it all works out perfectly where it's like these these these enzymes that like targeted too hot to might you note to basically become undergo mitosis AG it's like they recognize a certain one with it but slower membrane potential which happens to be more of a damaged mitochondria and it's just kind of like it's kind of beautiful houses all works out that way was I going to say I completely like was going to say I lost my train of thought there but yeah it's so anyways that the fact that you can like have new mitochondria is like pretty I mean that's kind of like the big thing with with aging has been not for a long time is like young new mitochondria I know you're probably aware of the study but they injected old mice with the blood of young mice and they found that the old my started behaving more lively and then they did the reverse they injected the young mice with the blood of old mice in the them I struggled and

<timemark seconds="7666" />

and deteriorated and now there's some crazy new start up where for was like eight grand they fill you up with a blood of young people recent the Trump arms it's fascinating so fascinated said anything about whether it's doing anyting I think he's just younger Snapchat filter on you cuz I find it very interesting for multiple reasons one it's like I could be applicable right easily but

<timemark seconds="7724" />

he wants inject himself with young people's blood or is doing it Trump delegate and Gawker bankrupt are all yeah he's a guy who he he financed Hulk Hogan's attack on Gawker because Gawker outed him as being do they allowed him as gay or they attacked him and they dig out really shity with him and you know he's a fucking billionaire so he went off and thank you for turning off your ad blocker enjoy the Forbes add light experience fuck off Nick Denton files for personal bankruptcy yeah he he went after that guy because of it go back to the other article so what he's doing given feels obsession with warding off dab it comes as no surprise to Silicon Valley billionaire is interested in at least one radical way of doing it injecting himself with the young person's blood

<timemark seconds="7782" />

wow Inc magazine published part of a year old interview with DeLand which the venture capitalist explains if he's interested in parabiosis which includes the practice of getting transfusions of blood from a younger person as a means of improving health and potentially reversing aging said I'm looking into the stuff I think it's really interesting for 48 year old entrepreneur is currently receiving reports that a fuel Capital employee actually the personal health director has a personal health director personal health director to Peter Thiel that's hilarious that's what you do when you're all going to get a personal health director interesting so this is actually happening so steel spends $40,000 per quarter per quarter

<timemark seconds="7838" />

to get an infusion of blood from an eighteen-year-old based on Research conducted at Stanford on extending the lives of mice so he's got one fucking 18 year old that is vampire rank one kid is giving them beads and broccoli sprouts and making them run up hills

<timemark seconds="7857" />

that's correct but you don't have to hope that kids not doing meth she don't like he's got his eighteen-year-old kid and all these young people and wow that is so crazy he's given six million dollars to biomedical Jen gerontologist dermatologist crazy fucker I had him on my podcast that's what I was saying when I was hanging out with them he's basing all of these putting all of his eggs in the basket of science he thinks the science of things like with Peter seals doing is going to be able to mitigate all this stuff that he's doing

<timemark seconds="7915" />

you're stuck at like now a kitty cat make you like 18 but we can stop you from dying but you know if that's possible she's going to be stuck perplexing I really enjoy talking to him and it but I found him to be quite perplexing because of the booze and because of the lack of exercise is big fucking crazy Gandalf beard there's a lot going on here a lot of damage here you know 4.8 million from as many as six hundred participants mounts to a scam

<timemark seconds="7957" />

what's certain is it's based on some intriguing if inconclusive science carmazi in a 32 year-old Princeton graduate and competitive roller said he was inspired by studies on my cell research with sewn together with their veins conjoined in a procedure called parabiosis okay that's what we're talking about that study about mice so what did you guys disagree with him think it was a big role is not working out ignore all the science on the the positive benefits of exercise and nutrition studies showing that that died on myself you know I have a huge impact on on aging and I mean just one more thing about this kind of people were thinking that it was there was something in the Youngblood that was present that you didn't notice it on the screen that was actually kind of

<timemark seconds="8017" />

what was responsible for rejuvenating tissues and growing your brain cells because that's what happened when you gave it to the older mice but then other studies her to come out also out of Stanford I'm showing that in fact it may not be so mean that's in the Youngblood but something that's in the old blood that's actually causing the Aging something called vcam-1 that starts do you start to make it as you're getting older and it like causes inflammation in the brain in like starts messing up things so there was a recent study that just came out and show that if you like make an antibody against that became law and prevent it from like doing its action it's like you can stop that from happening so anyways there's a lot to be figured out take goddamn solution Angel that's going to be weird old people become young it's not good people don't get any older

<timemark seconds="8077" />

if I ran into you like 20 years now I'm like damn freak me out of Arnold Schwarzenegger start looking like he was when he was 20 again would freak me out like we start seeing the change in the process we start seeing things reverse not just halt or mode

<timemark seconds="8102" />

you know some people kind of defy aging least to a certain extent like Tom Cruise is a perfect example of what they're feeling that dude up with Keanu Reeves I feel like the guys look the same for like a long time yes yeah that's that's just show you he's got some kind of like genetics there are there definitely are Tom Cruise 1983 2014 injecting him with some kind of young fluid and I mean look he's got fucking ungodly sums of money and that's part of part of the issue

<timemark seconds="8149" />

you know I mean they've

<timemark seconds="8152" />

date that you can definitely do things with money that look younger like figure out what they think is what is that picture up above what's that one with the shirt off one up there is that him working out up there see that shows aging so one of the right like he's got substantially less tone to his muscles but that could just be he's been busy

<timemark seconds="8181" />

does the Maverick Days Are Over go back what is that saying is it from 1986 to write on the set yesterday so that's also that there's not that much of a variability there could easily be just isn't working out as hard and mean when your on a movie set your work in 15 16 hours a day sometimes especially these gigantic big budget budget Blockbusters where your you know involved in these crazy stunts and all that stuff so interesting street on I mean it's it's so it's so weird that someone that's he's familiar with aging literature wood would disagree with with some of the signs out there like there's been studies looking out for example people that have like one 12 oz can of white sugar water sugar soda and kind of like sugary drink a day they have if you look at them there.

<timemark seconds="8241" />

are white blood cells raging when you look at their to Interlink there are two mirrors are shorter compared to people that don't have that soda everyday and that corresponds to like 4.6 years of biological aging and that's like someone at the same exact ages you but has a telomere that looks you know either five years older you know if I spoke to her yeah it's all based off of like this refined sugar soda personal life maybe that's why he's decided to put up these blinders and ignore the same well I think I'll see if he's interested in extending life span to like a massive Point sugary soft drinks may be linked to accelerated DNA aging study so he's doing all this bags in the basket of science it's kind of interesting that he is doing that though because he will concentrate like very heavy

<timemark seconds="8301" />

beyond that and again when we were talking about all this nutrition and exercise the benefits of it like. There's so much to study there's so much that it may be his maybe his desire to shoot out and go straight to the science of it only and talk about genetic manipulation and all these other different variables like maybe maybe there's something to that maybe you really can't spend enough time in both Fields totally makes sense and stem cell therapies that will help to keep yourself eventually and that will make a big difference in how I talk to you about my stem cell experiment now I got them for an injured shoulder I had a shoulder that I had a rotator cuff tear bicep tendon tear and labrum tear in my shoulder and it was most likely been dislocated before and I didn't know

<timemark seconds="8360" />

which is just a side effects of years of doing difficult stuff with your body especially Jiu-Jitsu cuz but you get to is all about joint manipulations and Joint locks and chokes and grappling and there's a lot of us a lot of damage that your body goes for everybody to know that does to get to a certain point time either have to get some for that form of surgery or has some pretty significant injuries if they have to work around so I he went to the doctor there was like well you probably have to get surgery like this is going to that if it if not now some sometime really soon because every time I workout if we get really sore and not have to ice it afterwards I get these shots and they're doing them from they their extracting the stem cells from woman's placenta and they take the stem cells and then shoot him into the area where you have the injury and the results are fucking freakish you heal like Wolverine and it's really bizarre and now this same shoulder that I have

<timemark seconds="8420" />

you know it like a real problem with where I was worried about needing surgery I do 90 lb presses with kettlebells with one shoulder and does not have no pain no pain no discomfort not bothering me at all and it's it's unbelievable how much strength and function that the shoulder has now or like kind of like a gold mine because they possess a type of stem-cell called multipotent stem cell which is able to form multiple different types of ear cartilage cells that uniform cartilage cells that form bone cells that form neurons are able to form lots of different types of cells and usually play Smite are just like thrown away so it's kind of cool companies that are freezing them down and finding you know donors that match

<timemark seconds="8480" />

the company is just give me a sec I'll scroll to my Instagram I'll find him cuz it wasn't that long ago that I was there but I posted something about on Instagram but I'm a giant believer in it and I've had some friends my friend John Dudley who's in Archer was experiencing tendonitis in one of his elbows for a long time I mean he had it and it was you know something that had been working through for quite a few years and he had one stem cell shot and then within two weeks the pain was completely gone yeah it's it's freaky what they're able to do I'm finding some cell therapies and then that's something that I'm extremely excited about for the future but have you ever tried a hydrolyzed collagen powder or like bone broth

<timemark seconds="8540" />

yeah so. That's another thing like cuz I I've been getting into the bone broth but I was doing how do I add hydrolyzed collagen powder to like my coffee in the morning and also my smoothies I do wall sits just like it's got a lot of the same things as bone broth broth probably actually even better cuz it has more stuff but it's been shown like an animal studies if you take the hydrolyzed collagen powder and like radio label it so you can follow where it goes in an animal it goes right to like the cartilage and the joints and ligaments I use it like his help me heal like injured wrist you know obviously like my injuries are like way way way way like less magnitude and something that you're experiencing your shoulder Total Sports Medicine in Vegas that's the name of the company that sell injections or what about the company that you applied biologics it's called the flograft amniotic fluid therapy that's what they're calling it but it's Total Sports Medicine in Las Vegas

<timemark seconds="8600" />

quiet Valley biologics is the company that you applied biologics flograft amniotic fluid therapy and my friend Rodney McGee dr. Roddy McGee is at Total Sports Medicine in Vegas he's awesome he's any such a knowledgeable guy to if you ever want to talk to him and get you in contact with him and explain all the details he talks like you you took a fucking teeth out together and confuse the shit out of anybody standing next to you actually there you can make stem cells from skin cells now she had bladder cancer and they created a completely new bladder from her skin cells are in a you know a lot of Tori environment and then replaced her her damaged bladder that's amazing I don't know about the clinical say that what they did with all I saw was more like the woman with someone was passing for a blindness and they're able to use skin cells from growing skin

<timemark seconds="8660" />

water is really cool too I mean lots and lots of animal studies but every once in a while there's like a new clinical study where they're just kind of piloting you know doing this and seeing the safety and in humans and and that is where I'm like I can't wait like you know it's crazy injections for my brain was very bizarre when we get past a healthy human State that's what I'm really not just concerned not concerned about rather but curious about like it's sure it's not even a strong enough word but I feel like within our lifetimes maybe it's 50 years whatever is going to be there going to be able to engineer a human body to perform and I'm sure you eat you know you were aware of myostatin Inhibitors and benefits shown that The Accidental ones they've done with like whippets and cows but then they started to do it on purpose for mice and there are the mice are living longer they're super mice there

<timemark seconds="8720" />

like way more muscular I think they like two to three times more muscular than the average miles they look freakish when they kill them when they killed him and they skinned them and they show the body of the Maus compared to with the muscle structure in comparison to body the natural Mouse it's like what in the fuck are you doing here like this is this is like the Hulk it's like you're making a a tiny thing you know and you're you're putting all this extra muscle on it and for whatever reason for living longer yeah that is that's the interesting part is that it's a living longer trying to figure that out like what cuz you're up there some sort of trade-off for you like see if we can find that Jamie the same the myostatin inhibitor studies they did on my because their physical performance was extraordinary like they could do things that the other mice just could not do but now on top of that they actually little bit longer

<timemark seconds="8780" />

yeah it's all it's all very interesting cuz if done with animals that you use I mean they're they're thinking that you could do it with animals that we use for food and they would just they would provide more meat that way which is kind of interesting but what's so I don't know OK is muscle mass and muscle fiber in age mice but does not Decay increase bone density or bone strength from snap

<timemark seconds="8811" />

is it that's an old study. Huh I saw it but it did that the sum of those images click on those images Jamie because some of those images you could see they had the bike go down there with the mice carcasses right there you see the difference in the size and honest on it and it's not necessarily yet I think it's actually the one where you made was that

<timemark seconds="8843" />

spider look out but yeah there it is you can see like the difference in the muscle size from the average Mouse which is on the left vs the myostatin Mouse miles. Knockout Mouse but look over there they're standing there that one Mouse just looks like a giant ass powerlifter Mouse

<timemark seconds="8863" />

these are strange times and it comes to the science really Charlie arms

<timemark seconds="8875" />

cool good Lord

<timemark seconds="8878" />

too credible I mean there you've got like two levels of it you've got level level a unlevel be who got the natural Mouse which is on the left what is this image what is this image titled okay bodybuilding and myostatin and there's an image of 3-1 is a control which is the average miles the other ones has dominant negative how does that work go at tribtoo eyes and the other one is follistatin and in the fall Staten one it is just the fucking Lee Haney of mice and it's a giant ass Mouse it's ridiculous

<timemark seconds="8915" />

it's like double the size of the middle Mouse which is double the size of the other Pathways to like do an injection and like all the sudden you're gaining lean muscle mass without like doing anything that would I don't know that's one of misconceptions about steroids you know people think that like you do steroids just get bigger and muscular and I have to work out what this is a guy this is bullshit what is bullshit you don't even click on that you take that fucking off that's allies that these goddamn supplement companies that do that that's really gross want two things they do is they pay someone to get in really great shape so someone gets in really great shape like they'll give him steroids a pump a mop and then they pay him to get fat so they pay him to stop working out they get fat and then they changed the way the lighting is like one of the things

<timemark seconds="8975" />

say when you dealing with fraudulent companies is the shirt off pics before and after a transformation is like in the the good picture there tan and the lighting is really good for accentuating muscle you know the shape of the muscles in the shadows and everything they look ripped and then the other one they like pasty and white and they pay these guys to get fat a friend of mine they paid him to do it yeah this thing right here that guy on the right the after is the fucking before and the guy on the left the before is they pay that guy to stop working out and give her people live with themselves like doing that like I just don't it seems like you want it

<timemark seconds="9023" />

oh why did somebody Photoshop they do that they do that too for sure they definitely do that too and our friend Chris Bell and Mark Bell who are in bigger stronger faster than you know they had they know a lot more about that than we do then there's a picture of him right above that that if you haven't seen a documentary a highly recommend it bigger stronger faster which talks about the supplement industry and uses steroids and all these different things but that's one of those weird practices they do like if you look at any of those before and after pictures it's mostly what you're saying me and less like a really a single company and they hired someone to take their product and continue to work out but even then it's like when you show up before and after what was the guy doing before what was a guy doing after how much is that a diet how much that is exercise like how do you know and I know it did you get a blood test on this guy's you on steroids like what what's what's Happening Here Yeah I think we should just focus on ways I can actually yeah

<timemark seconds="9083" />

obviously you know weightlifting and me to beat up on Aubrey de grey but when you when you brought up the science of nutrition in the factors you know the positive benefits of it what was his reaction and what episode does podcast podcast that that I did say I can't remember what episode but it's it's been a year-and-a-half at least I would say I can't remember his exact reaction I mean you can tell if you listen to the part I talk I talk a lot about we talk a lot about you know crispr and stem cell on a lot of these possible in therapy that are being used that can potentially extend lifespan but there's a point in the podcast where nutrition comes up and you can tell if it's a little awkward between two of us because we can't have different viewpoints and I'm not trying to be rude because

<timemark seconds="9142" />

yeah he's a hot guy that beard is fucking awesome though god dammit magnificent beard you're not going to buy you know 40 at 50% with diet and that's what he wants to do and that's fair but the point that I think it's it's one thing to say that and then disregard nutritional together you know cuz that's the cuz that's just stupid nutrition plays a role in the way you ate can so I think that should be you know it shouldn't be something that people should completely just disregard and not not think about it. I'm not even not think about when they talk publicly talk it down like I don't like that like like that's fine if you want to focus on Technologies and and I agree with that I'm All About You know all these gene therapy Technologies in crisper and you know induced pluripotent stem cells and I'm a huge huge fan of all that but I don't think that being a fan of that and being excited about what

<timemark seconds="9202" />

science in and What new technologies are are going to be able to bring us should be no make us talk about like kind of people are nutrition also a big factor is the way you feel and a big factor to assume he just has Justin just want to extend a shity life right you want to extend a life where you feel wonderful right and well if your boozing all the time like he has not got booze is every day I talked to her like we were drunk as fuck in New York I wanted that what is it a 2045 conference there's a conference in New York where all of these nutty people who think you're going to be able to download your brain into a super computer and the year 2045 Lexus extended life conference and was run by this Russian billionaire that I talk to which is he was a very odd character he was building a robot that they are not satisfied with the results of this robot so they they never unearth it than ever

<timemark seconds="9262" />

nailed it rather but these all these people is 2045 conference in New York were all like this Gathering of like these supergeeks that are all in various ways trying to extend life in Aubrey de grey was there as well and I met him at the bar and we spell fucking hammered we're going to Hamburg and we're talkin I'm like these that we extend life you're causing massive information brain cells that this is terrible what are we doing but you know I mean it deals are to like very contrary ways of existing to what extent diminish the potential of the life you're currently experiencing enjoy talking to him but I don't talk bad about him but when I was very shocked when I walked into his office at literally like 11 in the morning and he is already down two beers news August 3rd

<timemark seconds="9321" />

I was just I didn't I wasn't expecting that I wasn't I mean was completely shocking to me. They're hammering it you know I know who knows yeah yeah but I guess there's a lot of different approaches and I think he said his approaches welcome it's interesting and send it says it's just as important you know that to have a guy like that that's kind of fucking up his body and still still after it like it's it's interesting right now that the major differences between focusing on nutrition and that's something that that I want to get the message across the throne I want shows you right now the awesome science coming out but until then lets you know let's keep it going

we were talking at the muscle mass I start thinking about this time restricted eating have you heard about this at all time restricted eating eating with an like a certain time. That correlates unicorn spawn still like the day it has really profound effects on muscle mass without any other factors that have an exercise or anything that's mean that's extremely interest interesting but dislike time restricted eating is it's very important for for health and Metabolism it's all also something I've been obsessed with since like probably early summer I've been doing it like just Willie fanatic we making sure that I'm eating within like a no more than 12 hour. I try to do like 10 hours so I can you wake up in the morning

<timemark seconds="9426" />

you have a cup of coffee or we know you can meet you in a cup of black coffee the first thing you put into your system that's not water starts all these metabolic enzymes start them in your liver working out your guy starts using these enzymes and those enzymes are on a clock because humans are diurnal creatures were where were meant to be awake and working and active and thinking during the day and we sleep at night which is different from nocturnal creatures like some rodents in other animals that are you no sleep during the day and after night so because we're meant we are active during the day or diurnal all these all our metabolism metabolism enzymes all these things are active during the day and things that activate them are light light exposure and also food intake and xenobiotic is also something so anything that gets metabolized like fire by your system by deliver whatever activates these enzymes and once they're activated there on this like 12 hour clock where it's like okay so you're metabolizing

<timemark seconds="9486" />

Cook-Out fatty acids all these things well with your eating within that 12 hour clock but when you go beyond that 12-hour that's when things start to go really wrong cuz your metabolism enzymes are not doing things properly so you're not like insulin response of you're not even fatty acids and things like that just metabolism in general isn't not working as well in after 12 hours and so that's kind of a big eye opener I know there was a lot of people think they eat at 12 our time. Like if you were to survey them but I don't eat more than 12 hours but there's actually a study done by a friend of mine who's an expert in this field and Panda very good scientist you know a lot of research on this topic and he did a human study where he had like this app where people lock their fidget pictures of the food that they ate and it like you know sent to some database they hadn't had time stamp on it

<timemark seconds="9546" />

nfcu in the clock when they won their first cup of coffee or whatever was in the morning and then when they were eating and it turned out most people are actually eating in a 15 hour clock so they were having a cup of coffee you know eight 7 in the morning and they were you know they're eating at like nine 9:10 so much later the thing is is that like when you do that you start to gain more more fat you start to become more insulin sensitive and you start to like your muscle chest to waist regardless of what you eat regardless of what you eat so it's okay take the back so you would you eat healthy is seaweed healthy so if you're eating a terrible diet during a terrible diet that's in this has been turned in my psyche that plus sugar those two together which is the actual of the bad, nobody brought that up and you let them eat whenever they want so they can

<timemark seconds="9606" />

they're nocturnal but I'm just going to call it a day and they're days actually night just know that that's true if they're eating during the day and night they gained like you know tons a way you can fat become like tying a type 2 diabetic fatty liver Master breaking down like like earlier than they should but if you eat normal so if you're eating like a healthy diet that's not high fat high sugar you don't necessarily you're not necessarily going to gain more fat you don't you don't become type 2 diabetic and all that if you're not eating all the crap so you probably just going to be okay but if you take that same Mount Healthy diet and you make it eat within a timer stricted window of at least 12 hours actually the best was a 9 to 10 they gain way more muscle mass normal diet is way more muscle mass and its pee within a 9 hour window they had like a really improve endurance that's something I've noticed in myself but you within a 9 hour window and I go for a run the next morning

<timemark seconds="9666" />

my insurance is like very noticeably improved to like extremely noticeably improved like how do you time yourself at the beginning of your like when you first eat and then yes so I typically it will make it so my friend Kevin Rose has an app that like it's called darn what if he just as well that people have that can affect the way they respond to that sort of diet most the time people can respond goodbye

<timemark seconds="9711" />

introducing zero a new app to help you fast cuz I'm just kind of crazy about it and I just like remember it that day so I'm like okay I had my first cup of coffee at 8 a.m. but his app actually is really cool because it really helps you keep dragging it send you reminders so like helps you and it's a free app so anyways it's really cool because you can just like little these mice were gaining more muscle mass just now by doing anyting but eating with him this time restricted window and the thing that was also very interesting about this was that

<timemark seconds="9750" />

you can shoot a couple of days a week so they could like like let's say weekends when you have like special events in your leg out drinking or whatever you can you can cheat two nights and still have the same benefits that at least in my Speedo know if it's the same for him in such as doing trying to aggravate some data with humans he actually has an ongoing trial that anyone can sign up for it's called My circadian clock and it can also an app on his phone the phone that you just basically all you do is like sign a consent form take pictures of your food and and like allow certain data if you know different different Fitness data collection and said they're doing this clinical study with some humans from David azerrad hurricanes going to call her right now I think it's like the Circadian option which is the one I'm talking about heaven is like people that are doing intermittent fasting

<timemark seconds="9810" />

circadian clock you're on so that's what it's this 24-hour cycle day and night cycle so eating within at least a 12-hour window is 212 an hour is the most if you get up at 8 in the morning that's when you have your first cup of coffee that's when it starts not with food starts with first cup of coffee cuz that's interesting cuz a lot of people don't think that they think that they're still fasting they have a cup of coffee then they go run that's the thing I'm excited because coffee with black so people think if they have black coffee there fasting and they go run but black coffee is caffeine is a xenobiotic is something that has to be metabolized by liver enzymes you've got process of it so anything that Edison water like the same the same thing even herbal tea herbal teas all herb stuff in it so

<timemark seconds="9870" />

not it's not water write something that's kind of a question that is well it's a fasting or eating within like 9 hour window 10 hour window optimal 9 hours is really what I found to be optimal for endurance in terms of the animal studies like 10 hours also with a meeting there healthy diet within 10 hours they still had increaser lean muscle mass do anything else just because what was happening is they were there are basically a mitochondria working better and they're also getting rid of fat easier so you know so it increase or lean muscle mass that's incredible because I late at night all the time you're comedian in the morning paid out after show me news healthy food I like kefir and pistachio nuts I buy those

<timemark seconds="9930" />

big jugs of shelled pistachios so the shells Roots I just like piles of pistachios can I feel like I'm not even if that's good for you but this knowledge now knowing this I'm going to I'm going to cut that out now please let me know how that goes to start right now yeah that's awesome I mean like I said you can see there was cheating at least in mice twice twice a week was okay two times a week is a good cheap because it's like a weekend in the morning all the way up and so you can do it later I do a lot of work out fasted now the one things that I like to do is I get up in the morning without having anything and then I work out but I've been having coffee so I thought I was fasting and this is kind of what I was talking with Sachin about is that it's if your fasting itself asking itself is having a positive effect on all these enzymes

<timemark seconds="9990" />

so maybe there's some sort of cancelization out it's not empirical data on saying okay well you know not something that talks would like to look at humans because it's like a big question what if you are just fasting and Siri it's not your starting all those clocks the clocks clocks that sound like I said Fast Metabolism in a way to the makes it better so maybe it's not quite as the bad I like that that's perfect so shoot for 9 hours best especially for endurance like enhancements like really so in your at you know if you're up at 8 in the morning or 7 in the morning whatever it is you almost have to eat dinner

<timemark seconds="10046" />

like at 5 yeah that's the problem you have to gather fast in the morning we have to eat early which is before you go to work unless you're not right that's kind of the problem for people that are going you know some people that were talking about you they just take their breakfast to work and then wait so I'll wait till like 10 to eat or something like that because also there's people that like to go to the gym after work into this more time clock I got to eat douchiness oh really if you can start the clock later if that's possible for people that are working like that they don't have flexible hours then then it'd be better to start the clock later and there's a lot of human date on this like just looking at like the associations between people that eat within you know a 10:11 hour. And fast for 13 hours for example of women that do that that have already had

<timemark seconds="10106" />

best cancer they reduce their breast cancer risk of recurrence by like 40% it cost insulin sensitivity it lowers like igf-1 levels I mean it's just like it lowers all these like hormones and things that are known to promote cancer growth it's really a powerful thing and improves metabolism really improves metabolism and that's something that a couple of scientists that I talk to you that are easiest you are looking at and actively seeing that is just it seems to be really important obviously people doing shift work like nurses are kind of I mean that's the problem late shift stuff and they are there if they have twice cancer incidence like they're all so much more like you're eating like when you're at night. You know that your metabolism tall is Allscripts not only are you like when you're eating after the 12 hour clock are you not as insulin sensitive until you're blue

<timemark seconds="10166" />

glucose levels are higher so you're confusing your clock so kind of like it says okay I'm restarting now because it's late and getting my first signal in its after been it's been after 12 hours and it confused it so that when you go to sleep at 2 in the morning and go to sleep when you wake up the next morning and you have your meal it's already going to have started that clock a while ago so you won't be as insulin sensitive because the earlier in the day or the more insulin sensitive you are so you know what I mean so you're kind of like confusing the clock it's like this every complicated but I think important

<timemark seconds="10201" />

mechanism in system for people to understand and timer circuits time restricted eating like I've really implemented that because I think that's something that also will affect the aging process I've talked to people like a conference is giving a talk at that have come up to me afterwards and they're they're talking about how they've been on a ketogenic diet for 2 years and how it another reverse or type 2 diabetes been great but still there fasting blood glucose levels were still in the high-end even though they're no longer type 2 diabetic I mean which is really good and they started doing the time restricted eating with are we eating with a 9 hour window and it can only be resolved it completely resolved that accept multiple people tell me that answer saying is in the amazing thing is the increasing muscle the muscle is really the increase that I'm interesting part I would like to like talk to Sasha more about that have him do more experiments as possible because we didn't dive as much into that on the podcast we chatted but he is such a phenomenal scientist

<timemark seconds="10261" />

he's very proactive in into health and Agostino preventive medicine and he's just a great great person the Salk Institute in La Jolla very prestigious place to buy a lot of really good scientist are your podcast with him through Skype or did you know when I interviewed them so I have noticed on Skype ones and they're just like there's a disconnect come to your studio so right now I'm going around to institutes in with you know if I might like a place from giving a talk and I'm like this great scientist there I'm going to ask people to enter sat

<timemark seconds="10312" />

i c h i n satchin Panda but he's he's a really good person to talk to you to like he is very he noticed he speaks eloquently explain things when he's a little bit of an Indian accent but you know it's just it's kind of like cute but his scientist changed my life like a my circadian knowledge I've been following him for a few years like I've really looked up to him for a fact if I told him that I was like interested in doing a postdoc with him certain point like after I finish my Ph.D cuz I thought he was he was back back in 2012 when I graduated he was making these discoveries about late-night eating and how it like how it makes you more so you basically more insulin resistant how it's like screwing up brain function to

<timemark seconds="10372" />

all these things that I've even talked about an answer I got really interested in it because I know a lot of people that eat late at night and people that are having trouble losing weight and all that are eating late at night so that's amazing News podcast with you and your podcast check that out that's all that sounds awesome

<timemark seconds="10392" />

so the saturated fat sugar is what you want to do because you actually sent me an article about that which I found was really fascinating and although saturated fat is important it's how would you describe it as a precursor to hormones hormones so saturated fat increases LDL cholesterol LDL lipoprotein proteins which carry cholesterol and fatty acids always call it cholesterol to type of Transporter of cholesterol but it also transports fatty acids and other things but the thing is is you know the LDL is very very important because every time you make a new cell in your body which is happening constantly you're always making you immune cells or making new kidney cells are making you ever sells I mean it's happening all the time anytime you make a new cell you need LDL there to transport cholesterol and fatty acids because cell membrane the cell itself

<timemark seconds="10452" />

the membrane is made of it it has fatty acids in cholesterol and phospholipids and other things but so you need that cholesterol when you damage a cell you know and you're repairing that damage cholesterol needs to be there so I mean you really really need cholesterol LDL cholesterol is very important for that for that reason and without it you're kind of screwed right I mean you can't like repair damages well you're not going to make as many new cells so all these people that are avoiding saturated fats and cholesterol in their diet they're doing their literal doing literally doing their cell regeneration the service make the proxemics I don't know what else there in maybe they're getting other types of fatty acids that also help but yes people that are like on stands for example which is a very Broadway of inhibiting like cholesterol synthesis brought like. That's why a lot of those people are people on statins one of the major major side effects is muscle atrophy muscle wasting

<timemark seconds="10512" />

because your muscles one of the cells are constantly repairing damaged and making Russell and it's a big big problem huge problem with us. And it also so a colleague of mine Ron Krause he's at the twins Hospital in Oakland he has been studying statins and their effect on mitochondria and he was telling me that it's like toxic to mitochondria and he's trying to figure out why is it's like maybe that's partly why it's also causing muscle wasting so if people don't consume saturated fats or they lower their radically lower the saturated fat in their diet how does their body produce new cell membranes are all you know in your body and you're making it from there getting fatty acids they're getting it from plants and plant sterols are getting them from from other sources you know but I think the problem with the with the saturated fat

<timemark seconds="10572" />

it's not so much that cuz people still get it some degree I mean it's like berries and depending on what else they're eating but you know that I think the problem was that saturated fat was demonized demonized in a very corrupt way which is the reason New York Times article that was released which is a mind-blower which detailed how the sugar industry had bribed scientists to release dateh blaming saturated fat for heart disease and obesity and all these issues when I was in fact sugar that was causing all that so they were literally rigging the system and paying scientist knows a horrible article because that propaganda in these lies that they spread I believe it was in the 50s hairdos how the sugar industry shifted the blame to fat and it's if you get a chance and you want to feel sick at what

<timemark seconds="10632" />

can be done with money watch or read that because it's just it's awful it is really awful and it was an internal sugar industry document that was discovered by a researcher at the University of California San Francisco and was published it said Monday when this is out of believe it was a couple of months ago but it was amazing it suggested that five Decades of research into the role of nutrition heart disease including many of today's dietary recommendations may have been largely shaped by the sugar industry and propaganda and money they spent money to literally bribe scientist to release false data

<timemark seconds="10670" />

Horeb it's really nasty but I mean the thing isn't that much money either you're so cool go back to it they paid 3 Harvard scientist equivalent of $50,000 in today's dollars to publish 1967 review of research on sugar fat and heart disease is studies using the review were handpicked by the sugar group in the article which is published in the prestigious new New England Journal of Medicine minimize the link between sugar and heart health and cast aspirations on the role of saturated fat even though the influence peddling reveal the documents dates back to nearly 50 years more research reports show that the food industry has continued to influence nutrition science had such a Negative like there was such a negative consequences from this from the from the demonization of saturated fat because people then obviously started getting more refined like places for breakfast in the morning and said having eggs you're having like cereal but the real problem was the train

<timemark seconds="10730" />

that's because trans fats can can have similar for hydroponic hydrogenated fats which you know you take like a amount of saturated fat in hiding it and you can have similar properties properties and saturated fat like butter how it's solid and then being a melted at a higher temperature but he's trans fats I mean I remember my mom had a big tub of margarine margarine on are mashed potatoes healthy and it was literally that's what causes heart disease because the TransPass like I said you take these fats happened to your new cells right because that's part of what you know fatty acids in cholesterol that's part of what you're doing with him in your body the TransPass get taken up in the whole structure of it's screwed up so when it happens in the end of the illegal cells lining of blood vessels that makes the most are real stiff in like I mean it's just like screws it up to transfer out there like we have known about that like the fact that trans fats are playing a cause of World heart disease

<timemark seconds="10790" />

for like decades and the FDA finally in 2015 2015 okay finally banned them from the us and gave

<timemark seconds="10799" />

companies that are still putting them in their processed foods and a lot of fast food companies use like Crisco cuz it's cheaper three years to get it off the market so we have until 2018 Jesus Christ 3 years to get rid of that. You're already ate like Decades of knowing it's like you know that this is like it's like so bad so so bad for you anyways that's a that's a whole that's one of the major repercussions then I'll be sleeping in the people became scared of saturated fat and you know the thing at the same with the sugar and this is kind of what you were initially you know painting at is that a lot there were there happen a lot of studies that have linked you know that weren't corrupt you know by the sure that these were the early said he put there have been studies a howling saturated fat intake to heart disease and a lot of the study also because people were eating in addition to saturated fat didn't correct for like refined sugar intake which is really what the problem is and that has now been shown in multiple studies Sol

<timemark seconds="10859" />

this came down to actually being able to have new technology available that was able to then you know LDL is not there's not just one LDL cholesterol in the body comes in all sizes and the type the type that we're talking about the good type is a large buoyant typing that's what saturated fat increases there's also it gets processed into smaller parts that are small dense LDL and that's what it's basically it can't get recycled back to liver so it stays around the bloodstream it undergoes inflammatory Transformations and sticks in the blood vessel causes all this problem right that's what refined sugar and increases so like the healthy young man that were given 20 oz of soda a day for three weeks totally healthy young man increased this increase their a small dense LDL particles like massively increase or small dense LDL particles and also increase their inflammatory markers C-reactive protein but like almost 100% which is like crazy so

<timemark seconds="10918" />

we're talking about like another refined sugar is what can make saturated fat dangerous is it when you combine the two because the LDL gets processed into the small dense refined sugar that does that sound so small dense LDL vs. LDL all the particle sizes it's like we've known about this for at least a decade now like so Ron Krause he is he's a guy who actually Pioneer this assay and figured out how to measure them the small dense LDL to call the ion Mobility I say no Quest Labs does it but you can also ask your physician you can ask your position to measure the particle size but the thing is is that because it's not something that standard of care when you go in to measure your LDL cholesterol and it's above a certain number of positions are like freaking out and statins but the reality is that you need to look at the small dense LDL that's what's actually going to put you at risk for heart disease and that's just not standard of Carrie with the likes

<timemark seconds="10978" />

ask for it and so crazy such a vast difference in the consequences for your health but yet it's not tested even though the knowledge that I was talking to my like 88 year old Mentor who sings and I remember back in the eighties that we stayed away from that never gave margarine my children are a scientist like my mom wasn't like 5 station of it but I mean

<timemark seconds="11017" />

I don't know what. Much of a liar but it takes to know maybe these writers were committees make this probably a lot more than I know that goes into like figuring out like how you make these regulations it's only financially motivated that's what's disgusting about it they're giving these companies three years to get poison out of food that is what really upsets me I'm like okay you finally finally abandoned in the US three years for people to profit off of poisoning killing people and not letting you know I mean you should have a fucking cancer recommendation or it while warning the same way you have on cigarettes go to the supermarket and we'll say no trans fats on their food and all that but when they go to fast food or they go to some like restaurant where they using Crisco
