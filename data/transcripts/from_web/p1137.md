<timemark seconds="528" />

The Joe Rogan Experience

<timemark seconds="536" />

Duncan the ways of 11 dos laptop max keyboards can go fuck themselves there's a terrible keyboards they're not designed for comfort and writing this how I did get it thinner man Getting Thinner if it's a piece of paper and it magically unfolded expanse the right so it's sick how come they can do it why come you guys can't do it why you how come you only offer one shitty ass fucking keyboard find out if your MacBook qualified for Apple's keyboard repair program I don't want you repair the same shity keyboard I want you to make a real keyboard where you have like it's got like a little bit of a u shape to it will you finger that goes into the center was that called how they describe that and the keys have like a little a little bit of a dip to them and then in the middle you feed it or they are they are they have travel so your fingers know what's going on

<timemark seconds="596" />

you get tactile feedback more tactile feedback than this little cookie click things which might as well be you might as well be doing it on a iPad you know you have an iPad keyboard and it kind of works but it kind of doesn't cuz your fingers are all feeling the same thing every time want individual button to give you individual feedback so you don't have to think about what's happening he was just think about the words it feels like this they hired an alien at Apple that forgot that humans like to push buttons we like it it feels good it feels good there are ignoring like the basic human Drake which is like have you seen as dumb cubes nervous people get they've got like buttons and shit you spend all that extra energy in you put in your in your stress ball you see if people like to punch and press and click and switch and that's what Apple forgot it's like when I'm typing man

<timemark seconds="656" />

I like that I like like in The Shining when you hear that means I'm typing I like the sound the flutter of the keys is your writing that fucking Apple keyboard man when I went in I was so ready to buy a brand new Macbook Pro so excited really excited like 5 months from like 2014 or 2015 I mean an apple Fanboy but I will say that when it when I went in there with it

<timemark seconds="689" />

instead of trying to sell me the new Macbook she looked at it and was like what are you doing on the ground and she was like no I don't even need a new one outside of the fact that it's new whoever you are young lady

<timemark seconds="706" />

Odin blesses you and blesses you and bless you for your your your Truth for your wisdom computing power I was stunned mad cuz I like I've never intend that that moment is kind of made me perpetually love app cuz they're training their employees not to like like pressure cell shit but just to actually help your father out of stock

<timemark seconds="738" />

she's she's sick of her job going to her she's ready to quit for a while he's an asshole show Mike Mark's got a creepy wink what can you do now look if you like hey Susie make sure you have that copy done to Personnel by 2

<timemark seconds="785" />

nope unless you're doing it to everybody. I'm meeting you can go Peppa Peppa got any more of the finger guns gone he can't do you know I'm cool jobs do till like I have to imagine that that's gone like you know my house at finger guns Nerf guns that guy shoot my dogs every day in front of my wife I like looking at her Cavaliers and being like Bam Bam dead now what

<timemark seconds="819" />

can't even play around. It's like there's no room for new ones because there are crazy people to do shoot people you can't pretend to shoot people anymore this is exactly the fucking problem of being interconnected by technology is that we are paying for the sins of the of the small percentile absolute dumbass is on the planet and because of that there you know you know any time I look at a sign any sign its got like an obvious thing in it don't don't shut in the hot tub on the roller coaster when I look at that I think

<timemark seconds="862" />

that's because of dumb dumb dumb because there might be a person use in the roller coasters like I will be more fun didn't do it mean to do a Southern accent by the way I'm from the south I don't think they're all done this is too many people talking is too many people talking in this world didn't used to be like that this is a new thing for the last 10 years people started talking the average person did never voiced 20 years ago there's great things to anyone having a voice crate great great thing yeah but we're going to have to relearn human communication right we can't use the old rules for today it just can't work you can't work it is and it's too easy to be an asshole

<timemark seconds="913" />

people got to stop seeking that out like the lashing out at people for no reason since it's so crazy how many people do it you'll see someone post something and someone be like fuck you you dumb piece of shit don't you realize that this is why this and then that's why that he's doing this new psychedelic study psychedelics and flows dates so I retweeted tweet cuz he's like they're doing research right now leaving out just like God cool yeah I think so I get out it's probably like to find out for sure but we've been like 6 comments it's still up there if you all want to look some dude wrote to me something on the lines of like you're hurting people and don't even know it that's 6 down it's like hurting people I can't remember what

<timemark seconds="973" />

language you use but it's like what the fuck you think is a survey dude like what are you talking about like you're hurting people by demystifying and D stigmatizing psychedelics

<timemark seconds="992" />

little do you know you're finding cruelty cruelty when someone says something like that it's so terribly absolutely and possibly wrong from my reality tunnel that it's like I want to get married out Eternal in here cuz that guy really bad that he believes it well or is it roll it could be he's a troll it could be that he's had terrible experiences with psychedelics that's you know maybe he's one of those guys that had a real you don't look when people get really into something they want everybody to get into it I'm a terrible example that I'm telling everybody got to do yoga you got to do yoga this happens with with everything and people that get sober like people that have a real problem they have it like we all know someone has gone off the deep end with drugs right when they come out of that some folks turn into

<timemark seconds="1052" />

Vangelis for sobriety it's super annoying all positive experiences that were with the same substance is there negative experience in their fucking crazy head they decided because they had a bad trip every trip is bad the millions of people tripping all over the world taking mushrooms finding God and love and companionship in harmony with the universe and and acceptance of their mortality all that doesn't count cuz Billy couldn't keep a shit together at the Pink Floyd concert is this such an ass he decided to eat the entire bag of mushrooms and he tripped his balls off of a screaming they had to take her to the hospital for 4 hours and her boyfriend a new boyfriend want to beat him up okay there's a lot of people out there all lot of them a whole lot of them

<timemark seconds="1112" />

and these people that just aren't geared for psychedelics for whatever reason you know there's people that are really close to losing their shit with regular reality for sure for them it's not a good idea it's not a good idea absolutely that's definitely something that like in my old age I want to put in like italics and underlining that's what you just said because when I was younger than you are in that Evangelical part of your psychedelic life you can become like if you're not careful ridiculous and irresponsible and you start throwing out their dislike

<timemark seconds="1150" />

idea that is only fundamentally wrong it's fundamentally wrong in everything Which is far as I'm concerned which is not really at one she wore to your troubles so you know what I mean so but with psychedelics people think this is the answer this is the answer this is it this is what we need it's like wow it's part of what some people need but if you've got manic depression for example if you've got bipolar you know dude I had this moment where the some parents came up to me and work to tell you about this but they came in to talk to me it is showing they were like talking about other kids like my podcast and it was really sad because he had been in one of my podcast and I think he'd come on stage ask a question or something or are they were looking for a recording of the live show cuz they thought maybe they could hear him talk or get some like as in is laughter

<timemark seconds="1210" />

something but anyway what happened was he I think he had some kind of bipolar I'm not sure what but he is one of my friends Raven he's like his term gyro gyro is off a little bit you know something was off a little bit but anyway the kid went and did Ayahuasca in Peru he did at 8 at night or when you know how they're doing these like I don't know how they do every night or every other night eight night Retreat drinking the medicine every night and then after that went to some kind of like other Shaman or some woman I don't know who it was and I'm not sure the Deets but then he came home and he jumped off a waterfall and killed himself

<timemark seconds="1258" />

cuz cuz what it happened is he Mannix you was in a manic state it triggered a manic State and he killed himself and an RN

<timemark seconds="1272" />

that was not a waska you know that's like the Madison right and in so

<timemark seconds="1278" />

it just for some reason I think some people are D emphasizing what it means to be healed by the Psychedelic or to be worked on by psychedelic her to enter into that state because it's becoming thank God D stigmatized much more so I was 20 years ago Dude it was you couldn't even talk about it couldn't talk about it couldn't mention it it was you it was bad bad bad drugs with Heroin it was on the same level as like you if you're taking LSD that was like heroin math people to look at you like you're crazy and then there's also you know there's real problems people have with being tested at work a lot of people get tested at work and people worried about losing their jobs so drugs don't just become a thing where you could fuc up and you know and get addicted to them but now they've come to Phoenix for your livelihood to put the state of paranoia

<timemark seconds="1338" />

it's just imagine that feeling you're working for some office you're probably don't dig the gig anyway why you don't even like it may have to check your piss every now and then why you know when can I see you for a moment and put it into this cop and give me a little sample of your body fluids okay that didn't work anymore what does it figured a way around it so they had to collect your shit I need to see you shit I see your ass hole open and I need to see that to come out into the stopper where container yeah I'm going to be there but I bet every asshole has a thumbprint like you know everybody has a different thumbprint I bet like if you took asshole prints every human would also have like an a different asshole print and like

<timemark seconds="1398" />

imagine that was true it's like you could see foot fit in fingerprints like I'll look it gives you the ingredients this guy's like 60% asshole it says it it we just didn't look at this asshole like if you take a person's asshole and put like in your like a fucking asshole

<timemark seconds="1421" />

is the brown eye retina scan everyone wow sure probably the asshole at the thumbprint it's just like for sure you took psychedelics and it changed a little bit in the past but also if you really think about the fact that we are in a world where people have to go

<timemark seconds="1453" />

to work to do a job that by the way man it's there is a dude you need to get on this podcast and is a book that you would love David graeber wrote this book called bullshit jobs this guy is a fucking genius man in this book bullshit jobs breaks down the phenomena of how many many people are working in jobs that don't do anything for the world or the company they're working for and it's not like this judgemental thing where he's like yeah that's a bullshit job qualifications for your job to be a bullshit job is you know that it's really kind of a worthless job it's not really doing anything in my companies have gotten so fucking big that they end up having like departments are people running department or extra employees that don't really need to be there at all and they have to pretend

<timemark seconds="1513" />

to be to work that's what he writes about his he writes it if you really want to torture a person not only give them like the job of like you know pouring a glass of water in an empty glass and pouring it back but didn't add to it that they have to deceive their boss into thinking that they're like doing an important job or they lose their job so he's like scanning your pets to see if you're taking a substance that is allowing you to connect with home what you actually are they are also demanding that you spend many hours a day lying to them that you're doing work that you're not doing if you're fucking efficient you know and this is another thing I pray you're right about forgive me David graeber fan anyway I misconstrue this I read your writings stoned but the

<timemark seconds="1573" />

but the other fucking element to it that is absolutely atrocious and fucking horrible is that these substances are connecting is to home they don't want us to be in those States and they're asking us to fucking while day and you know what psychedelic means the etymology of psychedelic it means mind-manifesting or Soul manifesting right so a psychedelic and Nexus potentially with the truth what we are identity right and these companies they're asking us to fly to be the opposite of our identities to wear weird a suitors are some kind of dress code and is sitting at a square because you're efficient you get your job done in 45 minutes and for the next 6 hours you got to sit in

<timemark seconds="1630" />

type and pretend that you're working knowing it you're a person and knowing that this is like unethical your but if you if you like go and tell your boss hey man I don't really have much to do

<timemark seconds="1644" />

you might get fired the boss might like in the book he cites one person cuz he did like a survey and he cites one person he went to her boss and she's okay I can finish my job in 2 hours I need can I have other stuff to do when your boss is like don't talk about that stay quiet about that yeah man that's the fucking world where there's less to do computers are making shit fat give me exact same how many people right now are doing just that why the listening to this a lot less now that I really supposed to be doing some bullshit job and they're kind of sitting in front of the keyboard with earbuds on just barely pay attention try not to get caught looking at porn

<timemark seconds="1704" />

all over the planet over a million / a million in the workforce probably when do you think companies had to put in rules that you can't look at porn at work like that wasn't a thing in the 70s who wasn't it playing in the 80s it wasn't a thing and then all the sudden you could just find porn online and people would ever work computer is hooked up to the Internet like when did companies start going oh yeah we didn't know about that yeah you can't look at that when they have Penthouse like Penthouse Maggie like me and fucking like you know that for sure you could you can bring your looking at something online it's so much easier than going to the store and getting a hustler like the access is universal here be instantaneous everyone has the ability to just go and download

<timemark seconds="1764" />

you know if we're going to like ask questions that are impossible to answers like how many people right now do you think listening to the podcaster in their bullshit job jerking off the porn while they listed at least one dude that's what do do we could find a way to jerk off somewhere 5 minutes in this bathroom jerk off just think about this stupid if you scream like one knows when I come ice cream that's sexual assault now man fucked up you work with some guy and he's like 300 lb and you're like a hundred 50 lb

<timemark seconds="1821" />

I know I came and I need to figure out how to fix this computer we're going to have to unplug everything for what it was okay cool I want to go in the bathroom and I'm going to jerk off when I come ice cream

<timemark seconds="1833" />

dude I don't know why you even have to add the scream to it it's like I'm a dude it's a terrible Prospect I think it's interesting to cuz when you consider like the act of shiting versus active jerking off is like far more like repulsive your ear expelling like foul smelling toxins from your body into the toilet and if you say to your friend got to go take a shit man hit your friends probably going to be like no you didn't need to tell me that like okay I don't eat but your friends not going to be like really if you think about it it's like you're giving yourself a hand massage the inside like a little spray of like cream coming up its riffic no no don't do it at the office my God Jon

<timemark seconds="1889" />

don't do it here John Thomas picture John just with an itchy trigger finger just ready to reach in his pants John it's a gross relationship that the worker has now with the corporation and it's an unnatural relationship and it's a relationship that seems to have like dehumanized people to the point of being automatic guns that don't have a sex drive that don't deserve to be able to explore your Consciousness this is a real problem in 12 hours a day when he was a young man he told me where in one of the ancient texts where it was talking about battling a dragon and he said he's

<timemark seconds="1949" />

is this doesn't make sense cuz everything in here is supposed to be a story that actually happen like what is his Dragon of the Dragon is a metaphor for masturbation they tell him

<timemark seconds="1961" />

so the dragon it takes away young boys this is it is it is a metaphor for masturbation already knows about as much as anyone you're ever going to meet about Orthodox Jewish traditions and the study that shit every day 12 hours a day for years and Israel right yeah yeah so when he tells you about it and you know he got the trim he got the actual translation of the metaphor from a guy who's a scholar yeah dude yeah that's a matter for that's like if I wanted for whatever reason to this way people from jerking off I could come up with a better like things in the dragon the rappers in it you know that

<timemark seconds="2018" />

what would be like the creature version of a roll. Ball of dried, that you throw next to your bed and someone walks into your bedroom and sees the role of dried come clean asking if she's going to like that's gross you didn't clean up your cam Kleenex Ghostbuster villains right yeah what do you think about the anti fat movement anti-fat movement fat F A P oh no no jerking off and I felt sad if there's good and bad the good thing is sex will be way more pleasurable the bat is it'll be way more desirable so liked it to mitigate your sexual urges so you don't do stupid things and hang out stupid people and have sex with people you don't really like what you think you're hot cuz you're horny yeah and they're willing which is a lot of people

<timemark seconds="2078" />

Japanese relationships guys and gals and they're not really in love with

<timemark seconds="2091" />

you know what you like what do you think about it

<timemark seconds="2094" />

well what I think that they're you know what I said something I always think back on his when you were sponsored by flashlight and is when we're doing the podcast from your house and I need to come to do to your podcast I need walk away with a flashlight

<timemark seconds="2110" />

so I ended up with like

<timemark seconds="2113" />

three or four flashlights in like it first I just wanted like you had different types it first I just went for like the one that looks like a pussy right but then like you know it's like I got that one but then you act like one that was like I don't know man like some kind of like garlic and no it was really not it was really weird anyway in MN when I think back to the first time the second time or the third time I did it it wasn't getting the same effect words when I have sex

<timemark seconds="2152" />

weather human it's a completely different it feels like it's a completely different series of chemicals that must be being released in my mind you're uniting with someone you're bonding with someone you certainly get that oxytocin from orgasming together in my life I'm jerking off a lot it's like usually like there's something that imbalanced in there like I don't mean to apply likes ass into it at all I'm just saying like personally it feels a little dissipative when you're doing it a lot I don't know that all I completely agree that's the balance but the balance is also like you don't want to just be horny all the time cuz when you're horny you make City decisions so you like date someone just for sex

<timemark seconds="2205" />

yeah we need to act like I mean I think that there is something to be sad for figuring out how to deal with like that kind of energy like if that's in it that's an energetic State like if suddenly you get being horny is an energetic State horny and you sit in like watch the the feeling itself it's electrical I can feel it moving around in your body at 8 like it counts Mickey Twitchy a little bit like it's like a very potent energetic state so theoretically instead of trying to get the question would be rather is there a way to release that energy

<timemark seconds="2249" />

that isn't through the tip of my dick in the form of DNA is there a way for me to release that energy and other wazers the only way the only valve on that to come. The question what do you think I think there's when this natural build-up happens it makes people more easily aroused that makes people more concentrating on sex and I think that it that can put you out of balance to be put out of bounds Balls by too much masturbation that you definitely put out of balance by too much desire for sex cuz you just horny show you just take care of it yourself if you'd be relieved and then you can think clear you know I think the body needs a balance right that's why I'm a big proponent of exercise I'm a big proponent of meditation and mindfulness and just tryna that's all bills are toxic words right now meditation and mindfulness like there's something

<timemark seconds="2309" />

about it that's like all that's kind of a bull shity word you kind of just how about mindfulness like this yesterday one of these like boutique stores somebody made a sarcastic kids book called the grown-ups guide to mindfulness definitely has an obnoxious friend is into mindfulness cuz the rest of the book is just like at first but I think the guy that doesn't seem to really understand what it is in the book like it's a little confused about the nature of it but and I remember looking at that mean like oh I guess people are getting annoyed with the word mindfulness now like a pendulum swinging that way yeah yeah it's one of those words that people love to say it sounds good and it makes you seem like like a spiritual person so yeah went to work it's moved around and use too much like something happens to where it gets icky

<timemark seconds="2369" />

yeah it's like it becomes popular and then people start using it and then you see like a bunch of phony Guru type dude that seminars using and what's important here in mind for my at typically unique behaviors you know what I mean yeah especially when it comes to like people are full of shit is like a typical uniqueness like there's a just a thing that a lot of people adopt and it sounds like everyone else and it's just I hope you understand like what are you doing why you doing that you're adopting this weird funky thing you know I think it's really important that we practice mindfulness and falls into that falls into that even though it's an excellent practice you know it's called and I just now had I took on so I can better word I'm working with a actual

<timemark seconds="2427" />

our teacher of the year in which is like choking trampas lineage of Buddhism and he's amazing and he's and he's teaching me mindfulness meditation practice but how does he deal with masturbation is if he asked him that question but I think that probably I don't I can't answer for him I think it would fall in line with what you're saying with balance you know which is that it's really like sort of the concept with it is

<timemark seconds="2468" />

the thing that's happening right now whatever it maybe you can just you know apply mindfulness to it you can apply like being in the moment and being with the thing that's happening right now and so that the the thing is teaching me I love it so much dude because it isn't we will we or like out there crazy it's literally this very simple way that you meditate what are the way that you sit which is easier to cushion you put your hands on your knees and I and you sit back and that heat the word they use in this card UNH for it is the warrior pose and what that means is that it's a kind of confidence it's the way like people who are like confident sit so you sit like that when you're meditating your legs across your signature if you want and you look straight at about 8 feet

<timemark seconds="2525" />

9 ft

<timemark seconds="2528" />

any watch your breath and when you're going to your thoughts which happens of course you go you think thinking and then you go back to your breath that's it you say thinking you don't say you think it think thinking just took cuz what it was all these so like what what you start realizing when you start this practice and full disclosure here man you know me Joe I have problems with discipline and I probably would like sticking to stuff over and over again and working with this guy's been incredible because it's actually getting me to do it right but still I have like I did it today I didn't do it yesterday I'm just I don't want to get out there and some nonsense that I'm like spending all day long meditating but what you start seeing is

<timemark seconds="2577" />

when you're doing it is you realize like oh there's a psycho happening in my Consciousness in my mind there's a cycle it's happening in my life which is that I kind of blink end of the moment following the breath and I blink out of the moment and of the thought round right we're like little fireflies we flicker into the moment we're here now we're here we're not last night I thought we're not thinking about the next thing we're going to say we're not think about the next thing we're going to do just here in this moment and then we're off you know off and running like thinking about the bills forget about the girl thinking about the thing thinking about that and then that we didn't know they found another thought next thing you know you've been thinking for 3 years straight you know what I mean or 3 minutes or 5 hours or whatever and then you come back and that's the cycle this is a cycle that happened to mindfulness is starting to pay attention and in in in to that cycle

<timemark seconds="2637" />

the breathing thing is kind of like a respiratory mnemonic device which is that some of what's been happening me now is I'll just be like walking down the street and I notice my brat

<timemark seconds="2652" />

oh shit I'm back oh I'm here I was totally up in my head oh I'm back that was thinking you know that's all it's very very very simple. You just teach me the basics it right now because I think it pretty interesting on my own thank you about my own life and observing other people's lives I've come up with this thing that I bring up all the time that the momentum of your past like you're you're like so many people as they're going down the street so many people as their interacting with people they're carrying the momentum of all the fucked-up things that are going on bills they have to pay and things they forgot to do and a career they never chase in a girl they never called back and the thing that they lied about a thing they stole and the reason why they got fired from work and maybe if I call my boss craziness you're bringing with you into everything and that is so hard to escape it's so hard for people to escape the momentum of the past in old people sort of they get into this thing of defy

<timemark seconds="2712" />

find themselves by failures by past failures and never just learning from them go on that fucking loser I was a real problem to be able to learn from something into just look at yourself and it's painful to look at yourself so everybody wants to pretend that they didn't do anything wrong right that everybody else is an ass-whole and then yeah and so you when you do what you're doing by doing that is your stunting your own yourself cuz you're protecting your ego you like you know I didn't do anything wrong fucking man but you know you could have avoided that you know you could have done better I like everybody has moments like that a new life in the more you avoid those and don't take credit for the ones you actually fucked up the more you actually hurt yourself in this ironic thing because it seems like you're protecting yourself know your mom exonerating myself from Gill this fuck it wasn't me I didn't do it but you know you did so in your head you're the guy who lies about making mistakes instead of you're the guy I met

<timemark seconds="2772" />

it's up to your mistakes and realizes it was a mistake and then vows to do better that's beautiful I'm sorry to be able to and you got to be able to look at yourself like all the time now you just when you fuck up as you can avoid some of those fuck up you just look at yourself critically along the way but we all have to understand that we are all involving process but I have this conversation with Dennis McCann it's a crazy conversation because it's a ridiculous thing to say he was talking about Donald Trump and I was saying isn't it possible that he could grow and learn why do we give up on people why does a guy get to a certain age and we say oh he's 60 he's set in his ways he 70 he'll never change I'll never even when you don't ever say that about a 20 year old to see some assholes at the one-year-old you say he just needs discipline and just needs love you find the right people in his life right person to love he'll be okay

<timemark seconds="2832" />

he's going to make sure and eventually is going to be a solid man get to certain age we just give up on you I just like you're still alive but you passed the cycle that I usually enjoy people to be ready till like sort of interactive valuable creative loving members of society pass that but you're still thinking about yourself only deep in your 60s this is stupid shit this is you supposed to do when your 17 by the time your 7D you're supposed to be going oh my God I don't have much time left on my God like what have I done while I'm here what it what is it important what do I feel the best about a feel the best about love and companionship and friendship and real warped an interaction between two people that you care about this money thing man this is not you can't keep chasing this I can't keep chasing power can't keep chasing money if you're going to reach a point where it's not going to matter cuz you're going to die so you really want to be that guy from the bumper sticker he who dies with the most toys wins is this is literally what you're working towards you working towards a joke

<timemark seconds="2892" />

can I buy one thing I would add to that is that so you're saying here and you're you're right man but did that one thing I think I disagree with you on his hit you're creating a situation where that's it you die and that's it the momentum smart it's like the momentum goes into a black hole it's gone like the momentum has been like is descended is vanishes that moment I'm right but we have been taught us that actually that momentum keeps going that momentum doesn't just stop cuz your body stops rights that momentum keeps going what's really beautiful is like this and it's good that you called momentum that's exactly what it is what it feels like with me it's a tendency we have a tendency towards a certain thing we have proclivities and tendencies and habituation if you just kind of like if you put you and me in a room and put a bunch of different objects on the floor right you're going to go towards something and I'm going to go towards something out

<timemark seconds="2952" />

that's right you know if there's fucking VR goggles and I'm in a God damn bad ass like some kind of like badass compound bow manufactured at fucking DARPA you know what I mean the next VR goggles manufactured by DARPA I don't know I'm going for the VR goggles going to go for the right you can understand what karma is right so that's the momentum that's the moment show that thing that you've got right now when you begin to really look at it and think about it you could ask yourself when is start this momentum right when did this these proclivities in in in Tendencies and things that I'm being like sort of push towards when did they start a lot of it is your parents taught you certain things but that's horrible cigarettes you you got cook buy that bug already got hooked by that bug Red Band still hooked

<timemark seconds="3012" />

Madea's kicked it you know that's it that's a really really really common one man it's hard to find people on that guy who smokes I'm going to walk in the store and even though I know these things cause cancer I'm going to buy a pizza I'ma go outside and I can't wait to light it up I'm just not thinking about that right now man I'm trying to relax because I think you take that drag and you feel that cancer-causing chemical rush and you like I'll take it I'm alright today no cancer there see who can you take a big deep breath and blow it out you look at the other fellow cancer Dodgers and they're just looking at you and it's a smoking together and everybody just did just really good at dodging cancer time you smoke a cigarette you can imagine that you have this field right in the field is your health and in that field anytime you like exercise or do something you know the side instead of eating the fucking ice cream

<timemark seconds="3072" />

need to see we chat apps are like any time you do that you could just imagine obviously is not the way it works exactly we could think I'm planning a seed in this field right so if I keep planning certain types of seeds any type of field and I called today those seeds they're going to grow into something right that's Karma so what when when you know for a person when the cancer comes when the muscles come when the failure comes when the success comes if you look at that moment you realize this is actually the flowering of a thing that's been growing for a very long time inside of me or in the world or in time so that's the idea people already have within them planted all of these seeds that haven't haven't been Express yet in the time because they're still inside of them like the dude with the like imagine a guy with the guy who like shot the guy cuz he had road rage you know that guy

<timemark seconds="3132" />

4 years had a really bad anger disorder and he knew it you know there he would look he would think at times in this very, this moment I sure get really angry all the time I don't know if this is normal right kids that's it dude yeah yeah yeah yeah, so yeah man that's like cigarette smoking any kind of behavior that like is risky or over time produces some kind of negative result it's just planning seats you know and so the momentum you're experiencing right now is the sum total of all those fucking seeds that you planted in that were planted inside of you over the course of your life that's what you're you are you're like a walking field of karma at varying stages of growth growing varying types of vegetation and Summer Good summer bad but it's like that's what

<timemark seconds="3192" />

you are right now and what's beautiful about that is that means that you can start cultivating that field you know you don't have to just like let it grow wild and of in pretend every time you smoke a cigarette or do some stupid shit you're like an unconscious farmer you know right

<timemark seconds="3213" />

can't believe I'm drinking and driving again but forgot to get home well could you keep fucking drinking and driving dude do I plant my God you can call the field you don't have to just let it just like have fucking weird random weed spring up Phil WETA Patcher to have some weeds cuz those are fun and spending that tobacco money and spending that money thinking about all I can sir spending all that money just buying a big castle doll that cancer money look at all you've got the freedom to buy whatever you want I mean it's a person's choice but to get back to what you were just saying how about this how many people

<timemark seconds="3273" />

backhoe owns stock in companies that make chemotherapy drugs

<timemark seconds="3279" />

there's a big question like how many does people in their portfolio that they barely know about that they're like well you know I got a really big investment these days is to keep gene therapy for cancer is cancer out of and these days really interesting the problem is cigarettes addictive

<timemark seconds="3302" />

what does the killa addictive like I've smoked a cigarette before and it gives you a headrush is a medicine and it has like some health benefits if used in the right way and also it's a nootropic so it's like not it's not just like it gives you a rush it's like it's it it's sometimes you're broke seeing you a little bit yeah that was one of the most difficult things when he quit smoking was not having one way right that's right the nature of addiction at 8 what it's like Kudzu does the trees it wraps around your favorite thing in life and tricks you into cousin cuz you is a plant that was introduced from Japan and I think from Japan into the South and it's just a growing vine when it's eight wraps around trees and it covers them up completely so the trees can get

<timemark seconds="3362" />

sign in the trees just died yeah it wasn't native to the United States so sometimes I don't know maybe they took care of kudzu but when I was a kid you would drive by these beautiful Forest at work with a trees were just covered in Stockton Kaiser like that that's crazy it's like they got eaten by other plant that's right it's a metaphor for addiction is a perfect metaphor oh my God look at looks like they're alive just too much to know there's too much cool shit shit out there that that one that is that's insane

<timemark seconds="3422" />

I'll give you her standing there and it was green and oh my God I said let those fuckers take over that you want to look at your boring ass fucking Graybar to bullshit leaves on the ground or Friday we just take sides all the trees Everything Green is fuck like Flo Green Man like vibrant Flo green will you if you smoke weed are you going to trip balls yeah look at that what is that a carpeted statues of golf statue

<timemark seconds="3482" />

alcoholics will get their alcoholism wound up and their social life or like their creativity the Creative Cycle so they will think like fuck man without the booze I don't think I'm going to go to ride as well or you know whatever it is like mostly it's just people who have this really smart way to avoid getting healthier or the learning curve associated with getting out there and it's a really intelligent trick to playing yourself which is due imagine that

<timemark seconds="3521" />

you know whatever it maybe that's currently out of balance in your life if you remove that you're not going to be able to be as good as person you know there's a lot of Alcoholics out there performers you think if I don't drink I got to have a beer on stage Manor early it's hardcore is when it's like actually fucking wrapped up in the art publicly like I don't know if you're aware of this rapper who died named Lil peep know about Lil peep I heard about him yeah and one of his videos and shows like the floor of his car the pill bottles scattered everywhere it right so like part of the identity he was projecting into the world involves like the secession of addiction to pharmaceutical medications right and said that's work it's real or like big comics when all their jokes are about being fat and if they

<timemark seconds="3581" />

so it's so that they don't only have to like

<timemark seconds="3585" />

worry about like you know being fat they have to worry about if I got healthy I don't know if my jokes are going to work anymore so you know what I mean it's like that yeah that's a good one that one does creep in actually heard Kevin James I heard someone say that to him you lose weight you're losing rolls Browns AR-15 sound if you want to get them I don't remember you said that too but it's like yeah it's like you know you eat your Eva come this like character or something like in the next thing you know you're fucking addiction is like just riding you around like a horse whispering in your ear without me you will know where to go and now you're on your comfort blanket when you're all alone when you're drinking alone in your hotel room

<timemark seconds="3645" />

but you're like don't stores yourself celebrating it you're pretending anytime you find yourself pretending you're fucking Hunter S Thompson to get a cigarette holder and it's kind of like Hunter S Thompson it's like dude you need to go to bed like stop you're like you're you're tricking yourself now you know that's Yourself by the way if you want to be a self-destructive alcoholic drug addict whatever it is be that thing but don't fool yourself into thinking that's not what you're doing is romantic yeah yeah don't like as your plummeting towards splattering all over the fucking ground pretended you're flying towards the Earth I'll maybe you could

<timemark seconds="3705" />

good way to think about it right before impact maybe that's the water tower guy did you see when you do 8 days of Ayahuasca who knows what you say that seems like 8 days of any potent psychedelic I've never done that I've never done more than one day in a row I've done one day in a row take a break maybe a little pot the next day and then Donald do anything for like months that's how I've always done it I've never done like Bratz big session followed by big session you know we can only speculate I don't know exactly what that would be like I'm not going to imagine couldn't imagine dude I had this crazy like idea of the idea I don't know if it's true or not but obviously it's part not true but I got this crazy idea that like

<timemark seconds="3760" />

elegant like this with you I could just say this and I don't have to practice it but since people is in your pockets have to preface it by saying I do not believe this I'm not going insane but this is a fun thing to think about you know it's okay to imagine shit in your mind it's okay like you can imagine it's tough but so I was thinking like inspiration as physical thing like JRR Tolkien when you read Lord of the Rings it's like that guy went over there that writing is so beautiful and so perfect and so like interdimensional extra Dimension old it's fucking and it's beautiful is right outflow from the DMT realm into this Dimension through the through the processor of his meat computer and this is like a kind of drip coming

<timemark seconds="3820" />

have a damn right the damn is something that's been constructed by power structures he want to keep that realm out of here right and so over there you get usually a kind of message right in the message is usually something along the lines of

<timemark seconds="3842" />

we need to love each other we could love each other here there's something more important than money that's to really be very productive about it but some version of that story that usually involves some kind of

<timemark seconds="3857" />

I desire to no longer harm people are to reduce suffering or to be a better person or however you want to put it right so there's a damn that's been built and the dam is built by the people who stay in your piss for LSD its people who have created and intentional legal obstruction between one round in the other which is the real McKenna called hyperspace in the round that we're currently existing in which is where there's a lot of scientific materialism where people only believe that there's only matter here there's only matter that's it there's nothing else no Spirit no soul right the zookeeper's The Gatekeepers Builders and what happens is from time to time a big crack in the dam opens up right that's when someone like fucking Martin Luther King appears in his

<timemark seconds="3917" />

standing in front of so many people telling them I think that we're all the same is what I think I think we're all the same and he's doing this very karizmatik beautiful wet right now that's a big fucking crack in the damn because over on this side of things they don't want us to be all the same they want us to be separated by a lot of different fucking things they don't want us to be all the same over here so the cracks in the dam open up and the big cracks

<timemark seconds="3952" />

the little cracks they're like the good art the good poetry the great movies The Good the inspiration and now it's happening cuz of the fucking internet is these fucking cracks in the damn door opening up they can't seal them up anymore it's like you can't see all the fucking damn anymore in the singularity that McKenna was talking about the apocalypse which actually means lifting of the veil what that is is when the damn reaches like a point where the structural Integrity has been permanently compromised in the DMT realm flows into this dimension in the form of some kind of technology that either unifies all of us are like ripped a hole literally into whatever that membrane separates us from the infinite and that is what for whatever reason over in this Dimension people been trying to stop so cuz it impedes progress in terms of like making money

<timemark seconds="4013" />

welding businesses you can't be building businesses if people are doing LSD on their breaks I don't think that's true I think you could run a wonderful business no no no they're going to come back and then I'm going to be concerned with productivity if we get a group of people together and start building something amazing not for money I don't know I'm just being facetious when they let me play the devil nice to meet you finally can I have my soul back damnit this whole thing of you exploring hyper dimensional space and all that stuff all that does is make you stupider and you show up at work and you you're less discipline and not interested in getting the job done okay this company is built on teamwork okay how do you spell. Everyone pulling their weight in hyperspace from Friday night to Sunday morning and you barely get 6 hours sleep over the weekend you show up Monday I'm going to test you piss

<timemark seconds="4073" />

and if I find Scylla syban and everything else fucking squirrely the dangers of the variety of drugs I I like I'm talking to the devil tarot do you mind if I show you this because do if you noticed on this chart that again published in the landsat is peer reviewed this is a very important study Professor David not of course it since I think been disbarred in somewhere and accrued some kind of horrible punishment for being an advocate for psychedelics but anyway sir forgive me but if you don't you'll notice on this chart Scylla syban it is considered the least harmful of mind-altering I'm not interested in harmful sir I'm interested in productivity I want this place to run fast in competition and we're losing jobs overseas do you know they're going to start to make Harley motherfuking Davidson motorcycles and tile and yes sir

<timemark seconds="4133" />

what kind of shit is that it's a goddamn American bike and then make it over and fucking Asia why because the people in the factory in Kick-Ass okay they're over in the fucking Park taking their magic mushrooms and tripping balls when they should be thinking about how they keep this company active this company feeds and houses as 250 families you have said a hundred are you happy now I forget I picked up your prescription for Oxycontin yeah you're on Adderall you on methamphetamines here's the problem sir you don't realize this but you're kind of a low-level priest in in a religion that is spread far and wide and in this religion

<timemark seconds="4193" />

it's not really that that the money that you're interested in as much as it is the power because you've become a servant of a being called the demiurge which is essentially attempting to create a sort of authoritarian hierarchy in this particular Dimension that's been separated from another place known as the galactic you can call whatever the fuck you want but it's the aliens it's a Galactic Civilization that is about to pour into this civilization and so it really doesn't matter what you do because within the next 20 or 30 years through technology in through the unification of people because of the fact that technology you're going to either come to our side or go completely insane okay the counter that of course is the only way you're going to get there you fucking lazy hippies is if we make you go to work and we get shit done and you buy things and you keep this fucking country

<timemark seconds="4253" />

economy healthy that way the technology innovate we make the hyperspace Gateway you lazy fucking hippie tripping balls on your lawn furniture at creating shit okay you show up for work on time you get the job done eventually get our portal I'm reading David Gray here is a great turn on time right so I took the problem is that like that the thing you're doing with time or being on time that's a relatively new imposition into society and it started with clock towers during the Industrial Revolution they put clock towers up to the people always knew what time it was so they wouldn't be late for going to work in a in a factory you see there was a time when people weren't like obsessed with their fucking watch because the idea that you could sell time here

<timemark seconds="4313" />

it is so you think you and I've entered into a contract where for some ridiculous reason I've agreed to sell you 8 hours of time my time per day it's essentially a form of slavery it's a kind of like slavery except I get to go free for a certain amount of hours per week into servitude yeah we can call a power I can leave anytime I want indentured servants I don't think they could cuz they were kind of Trapped because until they pay a certain certain job to contract will you could quit my job to me that's kind of the rationalization that people use is there like you can leave anytime you want bud you leave anytime you want the hard drives are those jobs where people work for salary and their time is just whatever the project takes like you ever talk somebody works on video games right now but it's like they don't work in the big companies that they put in before video game is released is insane

<timemark seconds="4373" />

a lot of them just sleep in the offices are working 16 hours a day just crowding they're all living on top of each other oh yeah brutal and end this is some job you're asking for someone's whole life that's right you're asking for the whole life away from me and go camping yeah he usually get away from me have a picnic with your family you wish I can get away but for many many buns I want you all the time I just want you there all the time and then rent in exchange I'll give you some money conceptually I don't think that this is like a terrible situation as long as the person is really into what they're doing right and then what we have is just like I kind of like I guess you could say what a capitalist communist or I don't know what you call it like a group of people commuting together it is seeking no I extract money from the universe but also like

<timemark seconds="4433" />

you know what comes to mind sorry anyone from blizzard is listening you like doesn't like your job there but I got to I went to on this type of blizzard and they fucking the best video games outside of white with it right now I'm in the God of War it's so fucking good but it looks pretty badass it is amazing dude it's not the first AAA game I've liked in so long with the AAA expensive but God of War incredible dude dude so good man like I'm stuck in it right so you put on the HTC Vive today the new one that we have because you didn't get into a game yet there's there's some games in it where you just like what I see where this is going I saw that from yours

<timemark seconds="4493" />

but yours was but I was over your place where we at 2 or 3 years ago probably 2 years ago look how good that dude it's really good and it's and it's a bitch ass fucking thing freezing up again here it goes so this is actually gameplay let's amazing incredible tomato she's so hot

<timemark seconds="4528" />

looks like the graphics are incredible or the fight mechanics Witcher also incredible but the fucking story is really good and the acting is really good in like the relationships between characters are really intense this game will make you like tear up man like it's like you just got smashed by a giant smashed he gets smashed a lot but he's Kratos the god doesn't give a fuck I was not give a fuck boy was I don't want anybody to see any of the characters or know what's happening cuz it's that good like it's such a good game most games the way I play video games as I try to rush through it for some reason which is really dumb

<timemark seconds="4588" />

when the state this one you want to hang out look around like see the the landscape and like you get really into it it's a glorious game but to get back to her talking about it blizzard one of the people working there told me we

<timemark seconds="4609" />

like building World of Warcraft because we like playing World of Warcraft we've created a dimension we want to be inside of like we enjoy it they love it like in and that's why the game is so good because it's being made by people who enjoy playing the game so I don't know how many hours they work at blizzard I imagine it's it can be a pretty brutal schedule but and in anything you do even things you are I know but come grueling but I think that example of a company versus a company where you're like either doing something that you don't even need to be there to do or your comparison massive hours a day but I bet you're having a great time a lot of the time and the actual results and that was friends with a lot of those guys from It software back in the Quake 2 days and I'll play Quake 3 I got to play Quake 3 before it ever calories

<timemark seconds="4669" />

no that's Cliffy B he's it's off with it it software is doom and Quake Cliffy B is unreal and we'll just both amazing but we yeah we got to see Unreal Tournament when they were putting that together and they were putting together this new engine that will not being used in a bunch of different games after work but it was fucking crazy we get to see the graphics like I said they're designing things and same thing with the Quake Studio but those got all we're crazy gamer and parties and sink played at the software we got to play death matches between everybody in the idea was awesome to play Quake with the guys who made Quake fucking cool funny shit ever fucking cool man and you know I mean what they did was

<timemark seconds="4720" />

if you've never played one of those games before that the three-dimensional games when you're running down you hear things over here behind you yeah and you like you you know you could turn around and sneak around corners people are chasing around the map and sometimes you can walk and it doesn't make any noise or you can run you can hear the footsteps fucking cool I'm so terrified for putting a land in here in the next couple weeks we can have some fun dude played in forever please and played in forever I'm probably terrible

<timemark seconds="4762" />

I'm in the woods I'm a rabbit can get away from the wonderful fucking game within its deep and it's got a lot of stress and I love playing it man I really do I am not good at anymore I went there. Being good haven't played in a while cuz I've been playing God of War but look at this it just looks like death what is happening what is happening here what's your cards cards basically like I'm not going to explain the rules of hearthstone on your show.

<timemark seconds="4863" />

this is killing me it's a great it's a great very fun very enjoyable game good game for 9 year old girls so it looks like

<timemark seconds="4874" />

get it for my kids and it's taking like I to do is save Starcraft or I Could Have Lied but I knew I had to tell you the truth I knew you were addicted the real problem for you and I marry each other in our video game addictive tendencies

<timemark seconds="4900" />

and you told me something I've never forgotten and it's from the book of five rings by Miyamoto Musashi can you mention something from that book which is that one thing and you will know I do a lot of other stuff right yeah so he would apparently he would um he was a Samurai and so he recommended for Samurai not just to learn the sword but to learn poetry or not paint or not do this epic is in the meta process of learning you weren't you like there's something in there that bike fits on the all forms of learning right you don't want to be too hard but you don't want to be too soft you want to be a balance in a balance you must be you have to be artistic and destructive you have to be loving and hating

<timemark seconds="4960" />

sweet as opponents like he didn't just fight nobly he was an asshole he would like show up hours late for duels and make the guy wait so you knew the guy would be freaking out he would show up sometimes with wooden swords instead of metal swords to fuck with their heads one time you widdle the sword out of an order of the boat that he rode over to the beach where we supposed to have the sword Fighter 2 hours late dude up with an or yeah he would play games with people I knew that there was psychological warfare in him showing up late you know right do you remember the first sentence of the book I do not remember the quote that you just were talking about cuz I say it all the time it's like the reason why I have this tattoo on my arm this is Masashi you know once you understand the way broadly or once you know the way broadly you see it in all things

<timemark seconds="5020" />

if I practice something for example like right now like I'm learning how to do modular synthesis like at modular since they're badass it's like for making music right I'm 44 I'm not like thinking to myself like man one day I'm going to be fucking Bassnectar I'm not thinking that you know what I mean I live with him ever but I'm I got sucked into it and now I'm taking it seriously so I'm learning how to do it for real like and then that pulls you into like music theory rights and now you start looking at what what is this song and why does it song why is the song set up like it is and what are notes and what's a tongue right what's an oscillator what movies figs and then like from that you get pulled into like but tsaggaris you know like and then suddenly you're like reading like shitt by Pythagoras who like I had another great quote which is

<timemark seconds="5080" />

do not take the roads traveled by the public is pretty awesome which means

<timemark seconds="5089" />

because I've been studying like the modular synthesizer now when I sit down and play guitar like I'm a little better at it but then where it gets fucking weird is when I sit down and play like God of War I'm a little better at that too and then like when I'm thinking about cutting tomatoes for example something really basic in the pressure I'm exerting to cut the tomato versus the sharpness of the knife I think about music and I think about 100 in a weird way my knife is like at this is you want know what this is maybe like my knife is like a CV gate which is like if you have a town like one might be an on and off like a switch that makes the time to write write write show me the shit you're learning from like and by the way centers out there I'll know what I just fucking said every fucked it up I'm sorry I'm learning but but what I'm saying is it's like what he was

<timemark seconds="5149" />

what he was teaching is so powerful which is like you don't just get good at one thing it bleeds in the other shit in your life to sure that is an incredible thing for me to realize man it's been pretty intense cuz like you know when you like what you were saying you know year old books back to be learning something this or that but when you're in your forties you know you could trick yourself into thinking like I don't need to learn how to do anything anymore and then you basically like turning down all the lights in your life because when you start working on something

<timemark seconds="5191" />

even busy was going to ask you if maybe you don't video games oh for sure video games do we dismiss them because they were thought of his frivolous exercises in William brace Chasse and go and all that and even poker because we know that it's an intellectual Pursuits poker players are all super fucking smart guys the guys are really good at it yeah I think that we do that with video games because at one point in time they were just pong and then they were Mario Brothers and your silliness and Van you get the mushroom and have a good time and Pac-Man all that shed but now when you see God of War like okay well clearly your brain is firing on all cylinders are you doing that that's right yeah that's Your Brains Brains fire in left and right the idea that this is totally useless seems stupid yeah yeah it's that potentially through anything

<timemark seconds="5251" />

the promise video games as you can play them and actually not get better at them cuz you just like they're slashing and pressing buttons and shit like you can focus but I think when focus when your attention and focus gets put on improving anything like theoretically I imagine if you just started working on drawing a circle drawing Like A Perfect Circle I just spent the day after day working on that Pursuit sounds insane like you look crazy dear friends but potentially other shit in your life you start improving at to your mind gets a little sharper maybe maybe she's some kind of neurogenesis or something I don't know it's exercise your brain is very very active when you playing a video game you know where I know what I would play Quake my hands would get so sweaty that I would put antiperspirant on my hands I would spray antiperspirant all over my hands and then I would blow on them

<timemark seconds="5311" />

keep them from getting so sweaty because my fingers would barely they would slip around all the keyboard I leave puddles and keys my mouth would get soaking wet my it would be dripping all over the mouse pad in the ball would get stuck attracting first first was like you wanted that ball you wanted to feel that that the ball already a mouse a tactile sensation but then it got to a point with these laser ones were so much more accurate and they never fuck up they just became better today is the Mamba it was crazy play with it was so fast it was an odd shape I was a duck foot remember that you can switch me what you need

<timemark seconds="5371" />

2010 thousand series 200 slower slower small adjustments and you can think big moves with your hands and have so small just some guys when the adrenaline would kick-in they would like a slow Mouse peed in a big mouse pad help more precise that way then they were with a small pad and a high-speed because some guys used to like you little wrist flexor like super high speed and you would try their mouth you like a man can I try to set up cuz everybody setup and I would try their setup about Jesus not even concentrate this is crazy it's your moving so fast they would have their speed just moved out of my house acceleration fast would actually goes faster a whip like oh absolutely

<timemark seconds="5431" />

can you get used to that speed so if your mouse is fucked up you're definitely going to like you're going to make bad decisions but I never got like I got okay it's Starcraft I think I got up to like I don't know maybe silver league or something like that what does that mean so if you were interested not a big deal after that purple it's bright blue cuz bronze league is where I stayed forever white belt stage yeah mercilessly getting my fucking ass handed to me and bronze league and then like finally I figured it out a little bit and that's why I popped into the silver league and then you want to go back to the fucking bronze League cuz once you get to the Silver Lake you can't do a fucking

<timemark seconds="5478" />

early-game failing rush you can't like fuck that shit LOL what are you doing why are you doing that shit I wanted a real game you're going to do something like early game rushed gives you know when people get super mad when they fucking connection what time out and it would be stuck in the game and you fuck them up I'm up you know I sometimes you do use like your smallest gun and just slowly Pickaway their house yeah yeah it popped up in that new game for tonight everybody's playing and it's like it was a player ever cuz it's so many clearly got up to go get chips or maybe they and the dudes like shooting at them and

<timemark seconds="5538" />

hit like a stiff still person yeah man I really love them but I do like think to myself I still in practice cuz I'm like an older person I do think there's like a hierarchy of like what's good to do and I think it's back from me it's bad I like learning music right now like sitting down picking some basic thing about music figuring out one little thing about a module at one of my sense and what it does and understanding it and then life unfolding that into something bigger and that can lead the hours of of it where is like if I sit down and play God of War you know that's also going to lead 2 hours but at the end of it I'm going to know more about a story where's the other one I'm going to know a little bit more about how Sound Works in general which is a fascinating thing altogether

<timemark seconds="5598" />

I don't know what do you think is like there a hierarchy of shit to do like no I don't think there is I think there's a hierarchy and elevated passion levels it's like what are you passionate about something and you know you were very apathetic about it but then there was this other thing that you did that once you start like for some people it's all of the World Cup is on today I went to get a cup of coffee in the other World Cup on Gathering to watch the World Cup to me it's just dudes running around I don't know what's going on I don't know it was clearly in for the World movie did level of passion for that now if that was your thing I would say maybe you could be a commentator maybe you could be a player or maybe someone who produces one of those soccer shows or something it's plenty of gigs for that but if that's your thing and instead you get into shoe sales like Al Bundy you know after while the chips away I like does not what I like what I like is I want to play soccer I want to watch

<timemark seconds="5658" />

soccer I want to talk about soccer I want to commentate on sock you got to find the thing and that you are gold motor is true but it's also a loser mentality like someone can not everybody can but how many people try that's the other thing like people so not everybody can be successful comedian you're right how many people try though not that many people try more people could do it then then try I think there's a bunch of people that I could I would tell you that I told you about this guy my friend Dave Dolan who is my boss sees a private investigator when I was a kid I get got a gig driving him around he needed an assistant really got a DUI they took his license away needed driver that's so who's the funniest guy I've ever met Joey Diaz funny man and you know not no aspirations for comedy at all and his cousin was Billy Downs was one of the owners of the the comedy connect

<timemark seconds="5718" />

Boston so his his cousin was a former comedian who own a comedy club and just randomly became friends them from an add-on like you know like one of those newspaper a job seeking a private investigators assistant so funny fucking dude and he was always the guy that a bunch of people would say he would say something like a totally ridiculous look you in the eye and say it and everybody would be laughing it was just natural who does an actually funny guy just dissed didn't do it in private investigators loved it loved it loved busting people cheaters mostly people who are cheating on your insurance that was most he got one guy who kept asking him to take pictures of his girlfriend getting fucked by the giant bodybuilder do in after while

<timemark seconds="5778" />

off with the stinky shit I'm not giving you any more fucking bitch it's more picture you fucking idiot that's so funny that's so funny but diminutive very non masculine man and he had this bombshell girl that he had figured out a way to get a part of yeah and but she was just getting drilled on the side did she know he was getting pictures taken I don't think she did know I don't think she would be on the beach you get pictures on the beach making out stuff

<timemark seconds="5829" />

feel like you got enough pictures I mean I don't yeah sounds a little bit like this fucking heavy Boston accent I got you you fucking pictures did make them both right by taking anymore thank you that's not his thing he didn't really like that was rare most of time you work for insurance companies most of times like say if you were married and you are a woman and you had a different maiden name you would get injured on the job and then you would start using your maiden name and take a job on the side while you're getting workman's compensation some people get double pay camp out in front of people's houses where we would get there at 4 in the morning when everybody is asleep we sit in the car across the street and we'd wait sometimes earlier and we wait and we wait and we would 530 roll around and then

<timemark seconds="5889" />

light go on a like he's up he's up he's up here goes here we goes this motherfukers going to work there's a guy supposed to be laid up in bed and we catch him like working as a roofer in there getting disabled disability insurance most of it was disability insurance State of life to get into or you're doing insurance fraud like that's a that's a sad existence to like getting to that spot where you're like I'm going to get I'm going to give it to them and ask them to call me so if I get rid of their names I'm just not like that see this is the thing that it was nice people they just didn't know better and I don't say that like they're stupid I say that like they're just dated you caught they didn't think it was that big a deal they didn't think through it very well but there was a lady was so nice she he had a scam this was a scam say if you are license plate number who drive

<timemark seconds="5949" />

can your license plate number and then write down one that was really close to it and write down another one that was really close to that and then he would knock on your door I hate to bother you but my girlfriend was in a car accident and the police report where they had the witnesses driver's license number some coffee got spilled in the report and they don't know exactly what the license number is it's just we checked these two it's not them I have a friend who works in the DMV and they hook me up and then you tell her an injury oh I'm sorry what would happen to a she okay she's okay but she did this oh my God I had that same injury you tell them the injury that they had them giving them workman's compensation and at the same time it's terrible do you guys want to come and have a cup of coffee house stranger in the house like pilgrims these crazy this lady invited to guys into her house and

<timemark seconds="6009" />

he spins or yarn about his girlfriend being injured and she said I have the exact same problem and he said what what happened she said why was on the job as a flight attendant I fell down hurt myself he was wrong you getting paid aren't you and she goes oh not on I get in Pay but I'm also working under my maiden name and another job is like a great idea we can't turn her and he's like fuck her she goes goes. I love that shit man I like being nice has somehow become synonymous with not being dangerous or crook that's a really funny thing it's like is being nice is like that's like a really great costume to put on like if you want to camouflage yourself and you're a predator you know the Tiger

<timemark seconds="6069" />

lady who didn't think it was a big deal to rip off a corporation people grow up thinking corporations are faceless yeah nameless entities mechanics track money from them I think that's wise people think of some liability lawsuits you slip on some water in the hallway and a big building and you fall down a call I'm hurt I'm really protect me my balance was compromised and I fell on your ground somebody somebody put some water on your ground I'm not responsible for this and it's fact it's your friend Dolan my dick was Dave. When he comes out he helped me out there like you want to create a version of that woman wear like inside she didn't feel a little at least a little bad a little bitter little weak a little off balance

<timemark seconds="6129" />

reality the reality is she didn't feel good about that probably and that's not a great way to live man and end so by getting corrected by the universe in those ways you know I think it's it's it's a good thing I'm glad that you know some things aren't illegal for example but they are you know like obviously like we agree on some of these things right those things it's fucked up to bust people for if you're stealing in a n n n n a. In that way I don't know man no you're right no you're right but I would have never turned around I can't. I would have never been a good private investigator I just I feel like a lot of those people and I was wanting me at the time 21 at the time at the most 21 I think

<timemark seconds="6179" />

at that time I was really well aware of like the wrote the neighborhood where my grandparents grew up around and being around them and being around my parents who grew up in the sixties and then my grandparents who grew up let me know they were here in the depression and they just there was a different attitude about opportunity like everybody was poor and everybody would like to take advantage of every opportunity and if you got an opportunity to run a scam you did it terrible thing that happens in in poor communities is it people do think of like Insurance scams this kind of scam like you know you got to think about it like it's a score you know think about it like it's a score I heard I say that to me guys look you got to think about this is a score okay can't fuck this up you got an opportunity here all you have to do is you go to the fucking chiropractor my back hurts I Can't Tell You Why back hurts nobody knows why you fucking back hurts

<timemark seconds="6239" />

true yeah I'll do you go to chiropractor everyday and see my back is fucking killing me I got shooting pain down my leg they can't prove it or just prove it next thing you know you get a $35,000 check in the mail you know man here's a big number 1 I feel like I have to say this I would not have turn this fucking that woman in if I was not a private investigator course you would he would be guilty of stealing from the person who is giving him money to do the job problem with stealing like you know sometimes I've been hanging out with people you leave the grocery store and somehow they didn't charge for like I don't know about aloe water whatever like they didn't see it in the car right in the people some people are like

<timemark seconds="6292" />

I did it free water they fucked up right in like men I think those people are unaware of this like weird law in the universe which is that you seem to like have to get shipped back x 3 it feels like maybe a little bit more than that when you give or take or to feel like if you steal a $2 bottle of water now this is my Superstition you're going to end up paying like at least six bucks for that bottle of water and some other way of karmic what I'm sure it's going to happen you're going to take it you're going to get some weird fucking thing so I think a thief is unaware of a metaphysical economy which is like you think you're going to get away with that but you're you're not like if you could really get away with it I would give me pops but like I've noticed man all my friends who are really successful they leave giant fucking tip

<timemark seconds="6352" />

crazy tips crazy tips you know a few of these people Joe

<timemark seconds="6359" />

tips for like it makes the waitress cry and also I've noticed they will Dodge out of a place before they could be acknowledged for leaving some insanely mask tattoo I'm right here you don't have to talk about me like I'm not here I just want to embarrass you because it's like a lot of things but the main thing is like that's the love bomb that's why I would call that level of bomb for the waiter right but I think also there's another side to it that is more than just like the feeling you get of knowing you've been generous or not that attached to my kitten it's not even that said you get an opportunity to give a nudge in a pod they feel good so that they feel good it looks so I give you $100 tip for a fucking cup of coffee or something they get this feeling like holy shit all the sudden a beautiful feeling out of the normal situation so normal interaction I give you this and you give me that thank you

<timemark seconds="6419" />

rash all said boom you get this beautiful gift from a stranger did not have to do that for no reason at all just a little love bomb yeah it's it's even better we not there when you're in the car driving and they realize you'll see that thing right there man if you go back to what you're talking about about momentum money no it's been nice to people sometimes I've had days like I'm just walking somewhere and someone looks at me and they go hey how are you everything good yeah man everything's good how you doing I'm doing good I'm doing good enjoy the day just so nice little friendly interaction with some person you never met before and for no reason just wants to be a nice guy make you feel good man and concept but conversely weird moment I've had with people that have distracted and they're looking at the phone and not paying attention like this fucking dumb

<timemark seconds="6479" />

I do think it fits like a kid almost run your phone right there radiating this momentum right into the world they're not interacting with people that are there is a person who's like genuinely was good that's like some nice little thing like that that's right also the old man don't spread that person and then boom everybody saying hi to everybody everybody everybody that we talked about this probably every time because we both agree that this is like probably if there was going to be a non violent revolution

<timemark seconds="6525" />

in this country that wasn't based on voting it's going to start with that and what is that you know and in the the thing I'm being taught is like that thing you're talking about it can be cultivated in like refined so you can sort of that's why it's called a practice like when you're sitting and you're watching your breath and you're learning how to be in the moment

<timemark seconds="6551" />

instead of thinking I'm doing this for this reason or that like I'm doing this because when I'm like talking to somebody they're going to think I'm spiritual I'm doing this cuz I want to be more focused on doing this cuz I have an anxiety disorder I'm doing this because of this or that that's great but there's another reason to do it which is that if you get really good at being in the moment with people and also when you're sitting with yourself and learning Who You Are The Compassion to yourself because you're going to sit man and you're going to do that you wish I'd stayed under some rocks man you're going to see not just shit that's been done to you but you're going to see shit that you've done other people and you're going to have to deal with that right and in the way to deal with that is is not to do like I don't know if you do this at all but sometimes like I will remember something from when I was very young

<timemark seconds="6607" />

if you like you fucking dick I'll say it out loud to nobody yelling to someone like 15 years ago right like you mother fucker you know what you got me into if my memories Jesus Christ you do that in like so that's like the opposite of compassion for this out fright so anyway the point is if you can like sort of cultivate compassion for who you are right now that's not to say

<timemark seconds="6639" />

use that as an excuse to not try to become a kind of person but I'm saying cultivate compassion for the fact that like man your dad had PTSD and your fucking folks got divorced when you were 3 and your dad remarried an abusive woman who hated your fucking guts for seven fucking years and she did some really bad things to you over the course of that time that you are way too young to process way to deal with that and now when you're in your in your twenties or thirties you're realizing that you seem to be kind of a selfish, and it's like well yeah the reason you're being a selfish quote Kant is because you had to build up a very high-powered

<timemark seconds="6693" />

defense mechanism deal with the fact that you are abused for almost a decade when your brain was forming more neurons than it ever will at any other point and it's life and now we can start having compassion for ourselves instead of thinking I'm a selfish cont we can think

<timemark seconds="6710" />

oh I've got too big of a forcefield up I've developed the thing to protect me from an environment that I'm no longer in and then the point is once you start becoming compassionate for your to yourself that's when you run into the person is being a selfish cunt who you can look at and say oh oh I see you I know you are I don't know what it was I don't know if it was a abusive parent I don't know if it was a heartbreak I don't know what something you read I don't know I don't know I may be genetic I don't know but I know from looking into myself enough to know that you deserve more compassion then you're getting that's it so we have this agreement that everybody can learn up to a certain point right we agree that pretty much everyone who's normal and not impaired mentally can learn how to read

<timemark seconds="6770" />

I think so yeah we agree to simple mathematics everyone can learn how to add and subtract and multiply and then after that it gets a little squirrely with division can't, but we're agreeing that with minimal paying attention in school we could all achieve a certain level but there's is very little very little attention ever paid to considering how you behave and how you think and how you observe yourself and how you correct mistakes and how you learn from the past it's never taught it's one of the most important things I've ever learned in my life is too good to not cling on to the past but don't forget it either that's great remember that you fucked up don't do it again but don't live in this world of 20 years ago or 30 years ago or whatever that one instance where you wish you didn't say this one thing to some person or hit some person or drive your car when you shouldn't

<timemark seconds="6830" />

it was you still sit back no cock yeah you know I fight I rear-ended somebody wants with my car when I was on my way to selling it and I wasn't paying attention at a red light and my scarcely. I think it was a 1978 Oldsmobile Cutlass and the front anti crunch this guy's bumper with the the fiberglass part of my card in douche it to his car he got a Truck Yeah by fucked up my car on the way to selling it and I brought to this person to grill was like half hanging off and I remember in my car just going yeah

<timemark seconds="6868" />

I was so broke and such a loser I'm barely keeping it together and on my way to selling this car I fucked it up and I was just like you

<timemark seconds="6878" />

yeah I remember being in my car screaming at myself you fucking loser and I remember the guy bought it anyway just took a bunch of money off of it I forget what we agreed on but but this feeling would haunt me for months for months I'd be doing other things and I would think of rear end of that car not paying attention fucking up the front and even like an accident it was like I left my foot off the gas I just slammed into somebody cuz I wasn't paying attention right yeah so it was something that I literally was defining Myself by four months I was thinking that I was a loser cuz I did this yeah that's it right there don't let your foot off the brake pay attention what you're doing you're driving a fucking car I know you're only 18 but pay attention what the fuck you're doing it wasn't it wasn't that it was you fucking

<timemark seconds="6938" />

yeah scream at myself dude I was talking to this dude at one of these wrong. Retreats he's like in his twenties and like I'm really by the way this wasn't it I'm like really like the person very very deeply here like but the point is

<timemark seconds="6958" />

this person was telling me some shity thing that it happened to them when they were a kid right and real young and make it happen like it a doctor's office the doctor like reason

<timemark seconds="6983" />

well there's no reason is there just like there's really no reason to slap a kid he's come to a doctor's office right so short but was a reason my friend said well I was squirming around right he hadn't considered he had even considered that

<timemark seconds="7006" />

he was 5 so like I said to him like a man when was the last time you picked up a five year old do you know how small five-year-olds are do you understand that you didn't do anything wrong did that was a shity doctor that was a crazy fucking doctor and your whole life to rationalize the fact that sometimes people are crazy and slap little people you tried to apply some logic till to the act itself right now that's a heavy burden to carry cuz if you think you're a bad five-year-old you're probably going to think you're a bad 30 so it's like that mentality of

<timemark seconds="7056" />

looking back on our former self and hating it is the very same reason that we hate others it's identical if I'm going to hate myself definitely I'm giving myself permission 8 everybody else around me and that's so the work is let's figure out how to like be compassionate to our former selves and not just when we were fucking kids in the doctor's office and not just 10 years ago and not just 20 years ago like starting starting now like right now cuz you're sitting on top of a card house made of memory right and it's like that you're the entire thing so you got to love it all and then then if you start doing that shit I have noticed

<timemark seconds="7103" />

your degree of country drops by a lot is not going to go away it will definitely at least for me

<timemark seconds="7116" />

I mean want to things it I've ever had many guys ask me before like why do you why you so insist on exercise it's a big one like I know what helps me and I don't want it's like jerking off but for the body like instead of the distichs thing that you got when you jerk off this relief from the need for sex unnoticed tension that's constantly in your body that flavors the way you think about things it really just does

<timemark seconds="7150" />

that's not my daughter was upset at something is she had got into a little tiff Tiff one of her friends super of sad really their friend she's our friend was being mean and just didn't you know trying to deal with it we went to the garage and I said let's just go will work out you'll feel better and I put the pads on and I will start moving around start throwing some kicks and punches start breaking a sweat bee what happened to this is fun and then laughing and joking around and then we talked about it cuz right now you can talk about it rationally cuz now it's not fucking with you too you have this energy that's just picked up and then you're left with the thoughts but too many people get stuck with the energy and the thought and the energies overwhelming the thought and it's fucking emotional and a run around the block or fucking hitting the heavy bag of hitting the pad or whatever you're into take a yoga class whatever I went to drain the stress out of the body

<timemark seconds="7210" />

and then look at the object that idea for what it is and this is a fucking important method of managing the way you think about things that people Overlook they Overlook the impact of physical tension on the body and your decision making process in the body mean I know the traumas something that cleans inside your subconsciousness or subconsciousness is a part of your conscious and subconscious is supposedly reside in your body so why wouldn't it be in your body somehow way shape or form right you know there's also the idea that there's parts of your body that retain memory what would not just your brain but there's neurons in your body and perhaps they retain memory by like there's the concept that there's there's some type of neuron in the heart right yes and this is what a lot of people believe was responsible for this idea of Life follow your heart follow your heart maybe if you if those are your memory

<timemark seconds="7269" />

send your your database of collective emotional ideas of is really something to that and it like maybe it's not just in the brain area but also in the hardware and in all the neurons maybe we just we just think because our Consciousness resides in the brain that all of our memories reside there yeah and that they're not in various areas of our body if you look at transplants man one of the weird things that they say save big find that they have cravings for things right the person who donated the organ right right I don't know if that's real or not cuz obviously I've never gone to a transplant but I heard that shit a lot I heard that too and then someone was explaining it to me like well like I've got a fucking master's degree in broscience but they are you working tonight

<timemark seconds="7329" />

do thank you so much though I was just your dad's like let's go to the gym in the house in fucking kickbox you're upset that's super cool man I was just thinking that the other things only cool if they like it the thing is she likes to do it this is one thing to think is extremely important that I see people that get their son to play football cuz they played football in the kid doesn't want to play fucking football yeah man you got to let your kids be who they are they get super resentful I've seen people raise their kids and try to force their kids into holes you got to support them and love them and let them find their past you can't decide to go to be a doctor or decide you're going to be a lawyer decide you're going to be whatever the fuck you want them to be they got to be what they are we're all so different and you are literally robbing a kid of their future

<timemark seconds="7389" />

view over influence their distur choice-making in terms of like of not following their passion there or their dream of their ideas yeah and it can be done to say that I can't be done is it's all so many people can't do it so many people don't get their doctorate or how many people don't ever become scientist or astronauts or fucking mathematicians lot of things are hard to do man but you can't decide the way that kid's brain works you're not in there not in there and it's different than yours and hers is different than his friend his brother is different in this sister in the moms different at all of them and got to let people be you got to let him be have to in people don't and those fucking people hate their parents those people to develop this fucking cuz there's no Freedom they're fucking mom is always on them mom I don't want to do that

<timemark seconds="7446" />

talk to me like this you're my son I don't want you being a loser you understand it like I don't have a doctor and the parents don't talk to them anymore because they changed Majors stop talking to him I want to take him to come to you Thursday ideas we're going to send you to go to school when you going to take over the company business

<timemark seconds="7475" />

yeah maybe in a band some people have a really it's like we got to be so much kinder to people when you just think and shit like that melts you understand how people are like you run into just about anybody man and it's like so easy to have someone in your life and enjoy the idea that there are an asshole and I deserve it but if you spend just a speck of time thinking about it it's like it we really were in a weird way it sucks would just wait until you have kids like they used to be babies that's what happened to me I know you do when your early Montero etoc I don't know why but like yeah scared it's it's such a sacred thing thing to talk about it makes you feel vulnerable

<timemark seconds="7535" />

she feel nervous and because of that it is the most transformative like you know like you hear all the time I'm to the point where I was like suspicious of it like I was like you know I don't stand up his done this joke for a while so I think I'm allowed to stay or should I not even what's the rule. She's got some of my favorite jokes of all time many of them for your killer fucking joke about Cowboys

<timemark seconds="7569" />

pregnant people are like heroin addicts you know they're like just try it you'll love it just try it when you do it like you know your stock you're trapped which is how I used to think but man it's like so humbling

<timemark seconds="7585" />

to realize that all the shit you heard was true in the sense that you hear people say oh no it's psychedelic psychedelic not I always Associated that would like when the babies born

<timemark seconds="7599" />

there must be some serotonin or dopamine that gets released not just in the woman we know the woman's brain is flooded with oxytocin in a variety of things the mother the bonding chemicals but you know I thought well that are clearly would happen for the father maybe just not in the same level so when people say it's psychedelic that must be what they mean but now I know

<timemark seconds="7621" />

he knows the birth is it hasn't happened yet. But just being in the presence of a person is growing up life inside of their belly

<timemark seconds="7631" />

in realizing that like the bonding that's happening there in like the sacred duty is coming up if you being a father and that a soul is coming into this Dimension that is going to be completely dependent on you and my wife of course wanted to keep her safe and then man it the combination of all these things is so incredibly psychedelic in the most beautiful way and so humbling because it's like did I fucking tell myself that I'd figured out something really smart and that was like reproduction is a trick of the DNA and this marriage thing in the baby staying is some kind of vestigial societal organ like the appendix we don't need to do that there's nothing to it obviously I wasn't using that

<timemark seconds="7691" />

it was such a pretentious fucking pompous ridiculous place that I was standing at which is to judge

<timemark seconds="7703" />

people reproducing having enjoying the ability to judge because my parents reproduced you know what I realize like oh I was wrong but I wasn't just like kind of like I was deeply fundamentally completely for all about this phase of life in this what's the word for it this time

<timemark seconds="7734" />

why I like in Hinduism they call an ashram like a monastery it's called the grihastha ashram it's like a temple it's considered to be like a temple the family holy fuck man it's real the robbers hit the road man and it's like it's really really beautiful though obviously a little scary you know it's love it's real love and it's love where you know you know you're going to be able to love your children unconditionally and it is very strange that we really have a hard time with other people and I think the thing about it is not just that you're bringing a life into this world which is very psychedelic but that your love bond with this kid is so ultimate it's so it's so intense the love that you have for each other to raising the kid together there's a thing that happens with with with people when they are just really deeply

<timemark seconds="7790" />

connected data like a DNA level IQ this is a little person that is literally come out of nowhere from two bodies yeah and it's it makes you realize how precious life is how vulnerable we all are and it makes you realize the images such a cliche phrase the actual Power of Love right and it's not just the love of this kid or the love of yourselves the two together in the family together and all the other you know people that you love it's love of all people it's the love it's just if we just really have a hard time loving people have a really hard time trusting the people going to love us back and they're not going to get in our way they're not going to be overly needy or annoying and not going to be intrusive or the not going to tell you what to do which is why people hate their fucking parents telling them what to do all this bullshit love comes in on Sunday

<timemark seconds="7850" />

Gary's on you develop these The Shield that you put up for the whole world because of that that's what I'm one of the most common things that people do when it went in terms of like our definitions of Love redefined it by the people that were supposed to be the lovers in our lives but they're just unconditional kindness and love so so few people are balanced in the beginning of the relationship it's just lust and then after why you get annoyed with each other I can't wait to get free and find somebody else is going to make you happy make you happy either and most of us in the early years of our lives in particular we bounced around you know we would try to find a new person that's going to make us happy that's right and we attract the kind of people that are the most destructive for us and for some strange reason we're always looking to be distracted yeah and when I think when you can look and learn how to ban in that it's not to learn like now I know it's a slow gradual process where the instances of cuntiness occur

<timemark seconds="7910" />

frequently less and less and less and less frequently to you more more more kind and then you either you get it as good as you can get it on any given day and that's part of being the hairless ape in The Strange Land of Electronics and you know I'm in concrete buildings were you still trying to figure out the rules it is completely new way of living and part of this completely new way of living shifted over the last 10 years and that's where the internet comes in we're not 20 years no more than 24 years the whole world to change Topsy Turvy uptodown it mean the whole thing is just different now yeah it's a different reality anybody from any point in the past if you transport them to today they'd be living in some fucking Blade Runner movie I mean it really is a Ridley Scott film you know for sure if you were living in the 1950s and someone brought you to 2018 and picked you up from the airport at Tesla you're on a plane seems normal playing just like playing

<timemark seconds="7970" />

screens on the seats holy shit that mean in the seats and someone picks you up in a Tesla it doesn't make any noise it's electric is a giant laptop in the private it shows it's huge map and you're driving around and people are taking phone calls in the air what's up Mike what the fuck a driving around to all these different places and and you see that the the mass of humans in the architecture change and people would freak the fuck out sure this is the world we totally completely become accustom to that's right and no one this is no one's prepared for this we're all just playing it on either end of the worst aspects of it that some of the chaos and those social upheaval in the the way the being at the infighting between people people getting kicked out of restaurants do they work for the wrong people and get this if you see Maxine Waters telling people that if you find people that work for the Trump Administration you find them in a restaurant you find them anywhere you go and you get together

<timemark seconds="8030" />

group of people you build a crowd and you let them know that you don't agree with their policy so I can work on for gangs were calling for gangs of people randomly industry to interrupt people's meals interrupt people in stores get a crowd together don't let them be in to be safe in public cuz you disagree with their policies but this is getting crazy and I know one of the policies of the immigrants the children of immigrants being separated from the parents which I'm 100% with you it's immoral it's disgusting it's saddens me that it's even considered an option it makes no sense I don't give a fuck if they broke the law you don't take parents and kids and separate them you just fucking don't share testing there's other ways around it if you say well this should have broke the law maybe they shouldn't have broke the law. You don't get to do something that's a thousand times worse than crossing a line that dirt that fucking imaginary line of the dirt Crossing that is nothing in comparison to your crime of stealing a baby from its mother that's fucking insane that's not

<timemark seconds="8090" />

American 2018 that's just insane and we wouldn't be doing that to Canadians okay if Canadiens came over here with their beautiful cute blonde haired kids as we're not stealing them for their fucking parents and that's one of the reasons why it's sick the whole thing sick it's it's it's chaos so in what one hand on one hand I understand where a lot of people are outraged and I understand where they're coming from you shouldn't separate parents and their children in any way shape or form but the way to fix that is not saying anybody was on that team and it's working for that Administration should be chased by a mob of Street Vigilantes and you should encourage his mom make a crowd get everybody together make a crowd Make Some Noise let them know they're not welcome now we have a little bit of a

<timemark seconds="8141" />

slippery slope like wheat lets you know it I don't want to play mob Justice ping-pong with you because if I start playing that with you did not ping pong could potentially turn into a civil war do you know there was a reason USA Today poll this at 31% of America thinks that we're close to a civil war you said and then also people who like fantasize about a Civil War I don't know if they've really thought it out all the way like what that looks like I can answer that for you they definitely have it right as if they did and they thought that through and thought it was a good idea there are other fucking minds they're crazy or they're stupid yeah but but but he wants to fucking being a goddamn Civil War but that the notes for me

<timemark seconds="8200" />

when I see shit like that going down

<timemark seconds="8207" />

DIY come up with like I didn't come up with I got it from the fucking Dali Lama but I've come up with like a good little equation just to go back to which is does this reduce suffering right so like and I don't think it's it reduces suffering and these people are really upset on both sides of the fence are suffering like we're really looking at like a world where a lot of people are deeply upset deeply suffering and really scared and really really really freaking the fuck out in end as I've been watching this thing emerge on the internet on Twitter where people

<timemark seconds="8253" />

tweet things that paint that you look at it and you think it's almost as though you're living in another world than I am like the world that you're you're talking about man it's fucking terrifying like it's scary and it's like it's it's really fucked up and maybe like the reason I think that is because I started doing LSD when I was 16 so when I was when I was 16 I would our I became brutally aware of the fact that the current government in the past government was repressive and in an eye in something about that drug which I told you anymore cuz it's illegal I was a crazy kid but something about that drug

<timemark seconds="8304" />

really shows you the conditioning right and so I knew from pretty young age I was like oh wow I don't I don't think the United States is is dropping bombs on other countries because of Justice or some threat it appears to be that some people are making money off of this shit and I don't think these drugs are illegal because they're bad for you I think they're illegal because somebody doesn't want to experience these states of Consciousness because it will make them more difficult to Shear by this conversation with Hamilton Morris yesterday and he strongly disagrees cuz he's talked to the people actually in the DEA if she's talked to the people and drug enforcement and he said they're what really is happening is they have zero experience with these drugs but they know these drugs are illegal and so they pursue it as if it's a viable Target and we talked about in terms of like the real problem with law enforcement being that it's a game I've always said that like the real

<timemark seconds="8364" />

jobs is not cops the real problem cops is human nature this is a bad guy I get a point if I take him out you start looking for bad guys start looking for bad guys in uneven they start forcing situations yeah yeah yeah I know we do. We are sorry we get into this a lot and I don't mean the DEA like I've heard the exact same thing about the Tea Act like they don't think any of them have experience with him so I'm not even I'm talking about Tendencies so like if an individual has a tendency Ride Like the tendency so a person has a tendency better group of people might have a tendency for example if I get a group of Swedish people together and I'd bring them to the World Cup they're going to have the tendency to cheer for Sweden right I'm going to bed I'm going to gamble on that there's a tendency right but my boss fucking sucks he's a fucking asshole right

<timemark seconds="8423" />

play all your other boss is acting you realize like wait there seems to be a tendency when people are in that position of power to behave in a certain way right but what I'm saying is is the person who's in the position of power is that thing coming from inside of them or is it that there's something like built-in to the DNA of a leadership position they say that like in the same way like when you got a pregnant wife some new thing kicks in and I was reading about it built in it feels like it's like I'm getting a fucking security system I'm fucking like you know what I mean I want to make her safe I want to make sure that like we're saving money we're like you know what I mean I'm working harder than I've ever worked in my fucking life cuz I want to make sure that like there's plenty for her and plenty for the kids in like something kicks in there's a tendency there right so what I'm saying is there seems to be a tendency that happens when there is a

<timemark seconds="8483" />

virgins of people in power write it starts behaving in a certain way it builds walls it starts taking people to jail we don't belong in jail it dehumanizes essentially that's the fucking tendency right and so when you're taking a psychedelic and you look around and you realize oh I see the government though it's filled with people who are wonderful there people in the fucking DEA listen to your show and guaranteed love the show and I like your fucking right man I don't enforce these God damn laws arresting people for a thing that is like being shown on the way to be harmed the potentially therapeutic there's people in all branches of government there's some people you just need a job and maybe there's some assholes in there telling people that I have it also be drug dealers and this is part of the job so I'm not talking about the individual atomic structure of the power structure I'm talking about the sum total

<timemark seconds="8543" />

convergence the Gestalt that the thing emanate certain Behavior patterns and those fucking Behavior patterns those Behavior patterns have been going on for a very long time and so forever forever as far as we know right is always been getting on Justified I just think maybe because of the garishness of the current Administration compared to like Obama who is like you know we know what happened with Obama and the NSA we know what happened with Obama and we know what happened but we don't know what all the shit that probably happened with Obama but we do know with Obama and I remember hearing this man looking it up and looking it up again he apparently like the corded impact Maybe please find out if I'm wrong about this so I don't have to deal with 7 billion people call me a fucking mother fucker for the rest of my life but apparently he deported more people than any then

<timemark seconds="8603" />

all American presidents combined his administration deported more people he he's at the beginning of the he's done he might have beaten Obama store but the main thing is from saying here is like I think I've been aware of the fact that there is something wonky going on and it's walking the most rotten fruit away it's wonky in the sense that it kills people it separates children from families not just of immigrants but if some people are growing marijuana and guarantee their kids are in foster care now and they're in stock in jail right this is been going on and on and on and on I think maybe now it's great about the fear that we're seeing in the hyper reaction is if there is anything great about it is that people are waking up to the fact that our government right now the America

<timemark seconds="8663" />

Government is out of balance we've been at War for 90% of our history right and there's a lot of shit going on in there that doesn't need to be going on and we're waking up to it it just some people are like they're waking up to it like they were sleeping someone threw water in their face and they're like

<timemark seconds="8683" />

this is like you know this happened this sounds kind of sending I don't mean it to be but I when I was like Spike 18 or 17 looking at a fucking dollar bill tripping balls look at that fucking green pyramid in the weird symbols and then thinking like wait a minute

<timemark seconds="8700" />

this this is covered with a cold symbology all over it all over it and then there's something this shit this isn't really worth anything like this is just paper and then set it on fire you know just to do like the worst thing like it and I didn't I never ever not with Old Glory Glory the mobs of people doing mr. Hyper outrage almost to sell like we're looking at an immune response like that's kind of going overboard right exactly but if there's something positive in it it said it seems that huge swaths of people becoming familiar with a machinations of the American Empire and understanding that here's how

<timemark seconds="8760" />

working right now and will not only that like this illusion that it worked far differently when Obama was in office have you seen that video or Obama was running for president and he started talking about how to deal with immigration and immigration policies it's a disturbing video because it's a republican Viewpoint the way he's talking about it it sounds like someone running for a conservative position now it's not like this Democratic Socialist idea of eliminating ice you know there's a lot of people that they're there their ideas that immigration Customs Enforcement those people are monsters and we should eliminate the position we shouldn't have any more we should have open borders and those those Pete same people would love to have Obama in office you know they would think that it would be great if Obama was here boy it was so much better when Obama was you play that video find the video of Obama I think it was

<timemark seconds="8817" />

I want to see a 2000

<timemark seconds="8820" />

seven or eight or something like that something like that but it's one of those ones where you like whoa wait a minute what 2005 you watching you go what latest sounds like a republican like a mansion let's just imagine imagine this is a young blond white man who's saying this a 2018 listen listen listen is his position to better secure the border and a punish employers who choose to hire illegal immigrants yeah we are a generous and welcoming people here in the United States but those who enter the country illegally and those who employ them disrespect the rule of law

<timemark seconds="8868" />

what's the date on that video 2005 that's for sure the date on the actual upload flashback 2005 Senate Senator Obama audition immigration okay now here's the thing man his lips look at it I've looked up that Obama has deported more people than any American president start tracking for those who are following the law but why don't you call someone would know if that was a real C-SPAN thing I think we need to better secure the border and a punish employers would choose to hire illegal immigrants it's just off but it's the same words he saying the same words

<timemark seconds="8928" />

like in this is on your mind going to deal with even more like and also I'm not saying like I would never do that I'm just saying like that looks a little fishy but you can just look up did Obama Deport more people than it was before you asked me to find a video and they fining various problems in the debt statement or statistics of Snopes has it but they've changed it to a mixture instead of being true or false because the definition of a deportation was changed at some point in the last couple years that a lot of people you know like I don't know like how many or I don't know I wasn't Justin Trudeau open borders at everybody in what please find out if that fucking clip was actually said we would know if it was you would kind of now because that's a pretty famous clap and it gets use all the time participate in these negotiations to better secure

<timemark seconds="8988" />

what's up with the fucking sex illegal immigrants and welcoming people are you watching it okay when was it published this was a problem 2005 okay great that Radiolab one where they were showing how good it is today so I can tell it's close it's good to real close to being indistinguishable especially for you and I mean we have over a hundred wait till you see that stupid shit people make us a man it's going to be so fucking think it's embarrassing for you if you watch it like there's a million things to watch and watch people put words in your mouth

<timemark seconds="9048" />

that this there's a prop there's an imbalance here and it's definitely the balance yet I think that imbalance is being exposed by people's real opinion in this is one of the reasons why actual education and actual like raising of human beings is going to be in critically critically important where's we ignored is being not important for a while what's way more important now because the community is gotten closer than ever the community of humans and by not respecting this community and not really concentrating on the way people behave and think rather than what they own or what their job title is or what degree they have instead of concentrating on the one of the things that's most important for us is the way we interact with each other right we we have created this issue where now that everyone has a word in you got all these broken people chiming in growing in insult bombs and look anytime

<timemark seconds="9108" />

when is in the news who does something remotely questionable the collar of cunt Brigade comes out in full force on Twitter and it's all these fake account on eggs and some people in real accounts just want attention and they just attack I mean this is just a kiss is a real thing and not just women but they do it to me in to shit way it always takes on a particularly vile kreepeek was like finally I get to say this thing and what would have happened there but somebody got raised badly somebody's somebody did a terrible job raising a man they got into this position with his is this broken bundle of emotions and memories and they're all fucked up with no self-esteem yeah and they find some little Target online whatever doesn't fuck you Duncan Trussell you fucking sellout faggot and next thing you know they're attacking you and you might just be about to go to the movies with your wife and you read out what the fuck is this guy's problem man I do anything you put your phone down and going to that theater and you're all pissed off at him back but you should you can't

<timemark seconds="9168" />

bad thing is you going to miss a lot of good people but the good thing is you going to put a lot out but you got yet to put a lot of good out there but you can't dwell too much in the back we're going to get through this this is a tumultuous adolescence stage of human interaction higher level of understanding of each other in a higher level of understanding of community and you know this is why all these school shootings are happening and all this chaos and people driving trucks into crowds and shit it's because people are feeling out of this this this project of civilization and culture they feel horribly suicidal and depressed and confused and hateful and angry and they're filled up with chemicals and pharmaceuticals and loneliness and despair and anger and resentment and religious fervor in whatever the fuck else is pushing them to his life and then they react they explode and explode all over the place

<timemark seconds="9228" />

explosion know you got to figure out why people are exploding how come no one is concentrated why people are exposed to the women want to go at the toxic masculinity and the man want to go we're Asian pussies and if nobody wants to figure out what the fuck it is and they just hope that it doesn't happen again and then it happens again the argument starts up and Ted Nugent calls everybody a cock and the fucking the guns taken away they all fucking storm in and they have a band and they do the shrieking from the Senator's house at 2 in the morning and they start tweeting up a storm examining the behavior in the development of the human being it's a non-issue in our culture it's one of the most important things about being a person you got to wait till you get 3:30 and you take a fucking Anthony Robbins seminar and try to get your shit together with something new preacher doubt a Malibu the rock and roll

<timemark seconds="9288" />

yeah it's amazing the guy plays piano and he fucks everybody he can it's chaos this is where we are at this stage where all this information flowing around and we gotta come up with management skills management skills for behavior and communication that's right love that description is such a perfect description I think that's a that's that's that's like the main thing for everyone is freaked out to remind themselves I was like yeah of course you're freaked out of course that's the right way to feel in a snowstorm this is what you're going to feel like I can't quite see what's up I have to be more compassionate when I went to super freaking out sometimes I judge them and then they should be more compassionate to ourselves but if this is the state of chaos about management skills

<timemark seconds="9348" />

this is a thing this guy Jack kornfield 11 my podcast sometimes taught me this guy's amazing he's a Buddhist teacher but he says

<timemark seconds="9360" />

10 to the part of the garden that you can touch right and I think that is such an incredible incredible instructors agree with all that cuz you just described where like you see the thing and you realize like whatever it may be the thing the school shooting the immigration the bus that whatever and you really do you get this sad feeling there's nothing I can do about that and so you can you like in up online you're scared fear in Buddhism is called anger like when fear gets hot and turns in anger so you're going to turn your going to be angry cuz you're scared and then you start firing these like shots online in the entire time you're doing that

<timemark seconds="9410" />

entire time you're doing that your mother who lives at the other you know somewhere in the middle of the country is living by yourself in a house where she does have enough money and the house is dilapidated and you haven't been paying attention to her she needs your fucking help right it's not time for you necessarily even though your aspiration to rebalance a democracy is beautiful and we all want that

<timemark seconds="9440" />

you're fucking neglecting one of your best friends not your mom you know I'm saying so someone you know is exhibiting like some fucking behaviors that are like off a little bit or like somebody in your neighborhood or you know so it's like the whole time your mind do anger is focusing on the fucking press secretary Way Joe I don't think the press secretary I could be totally off on this but you want to talk about shooting the fucking messenger man

<timemark seconds="9478" />

it's such a perfect day when she's the messenger literally like that that woman like that that is a messenger like is she right it does she have the most pleasing personality do you agree with her politics probably not but like come on man yeah I'll tell you this if she didn't have that kind of personality imagine if she was like cheerful to Jim cast it was fucking screaming at her Acosta whatever his name is but I got to get tackled everywhere he goes now they put signs up behind them to say CNN sucks there's some really fun things about the Trump Administration some really fun things and one of the fun things is he's people that a journalist to take some super serious are they getting shit on for the first time I mean they're getting there getting called out for some of their ridiculous Behavior like yelling out questions during a press conference at your questions more important than all the people around you that might be politely raising their hand you've decided

<timemark seconds="9538" />

what is to know they hold your feet to the fire okay maybe maybe maybe this is not the way to communicate with people ever maybe this Maxine Waters idea but like getting people to protest people in restaurants build a crowd let them know that they're not welcome came maybe that's the only way right let's just play Devil's Advocate if you're looking at all these people that are imposing is immoral policy separating children from their parents which seems to be the most egregious that's one that bothers us the most everyone that's the one that's most horrific so how late is the best far away this on here but how do you stop that if you just let it happen to be smiling demons just passed these laws and laugh in your face and is no push-back that doesn't work so with the push back how to get pushed back this work it's weird they might have a point okay if you're dealing with something that's that disgusting as long as there's no actual violence you're dealing with something that's so hang right

stop being poor people from their parents are just coming over here trying to take a chance to get a migrant labor work job I know you don't you can't come over here who are you protecting man who's who who were they competing with to get these fucking strawberry picking jobs nobody is bullshit how do you stop that from happening so in the middle and it wouldn't be until this law gets changed we reconsider the the Humane aspects of this lock how many people's lives are going to get ruined how many lives of the kids are going to get to traumatically separated from the parents and develops to become a more fucked up person who truly resents and hates United States I'm not surprised I want to know the story it's that but how would you stop that I don't know how you would stop. But one of the only ways that I could think of being

<timemark seconds="9657" />

really really effective in getting a message across is to make it super uncomfortable for people that push that message through sure what people that support that policy people that think it's not a big deal cheer Jeff sessions gave a speech where they made a joke about separating kids from their families and the audience laughed it was on the cover of like every new source today so fucking sessions but this poor little fuck it's the same thing with him like this guy and he just stopped evolving and he got into this rain is not getting information is not getting it is not a sun interact with people is not involving his ideas he's stuck on this people who smoke marijuana or bad people face no more on you know in a lot of ways and if this is the product of his environment as a product of his interactions in the ecosystem and that he exists in the existing his bubble

<timemark seconds="9714" />

Jeff sessions speaking out about separating families has become radicalized we hear views on television today and that are on The Lunatic Fringe Franklin and what is perhaps more galling is the he pocked hypocrisy these same people live in gated communities many of them and add event where you have to have an ID to even come in and hear him speak I like the little security around themselves and if you try to scale the fence believe me they are even too happy to have you arrested and separated from your children it seem like that it was actually written

<timemark seconds="9760" />

says the fucking guy getting people arrested for marijuana what a loon well you know obviously you fucking dummy there's a big difference between summer break in your house and breaking into the country try to get a job you're not saying that people should break into people's houses something in the world is a force that is actively trying to reduce love in the universe and it's fucking real and so that's the if you want to come up with an ice War name for what's happening this revolution that's happening and it is is supporting the law to have a law in this is how we keep a beautiful country like America the reason why we have nice clean streets the reason why I have cops Social Security and great because we have rules and as soon as we just allow people to buy

<timemark seconds="9820" />

El Paso's real people that don't agree with our way of life. They don't don't support our way of life they just want to come over here and mooch off the system that's harder for you it's harder for him it's harder for everybody else call Johnny taxpayer out there has to pay for these migrant so you don't even know they're not even a part of your clan if I'm another close by Planet Jeff but here's a bigger props okay and in your right and everything you just said Mr sessions Too Legit to Quit and ends in some way that I I guess it's true but like if we look at it from a bigger perspective which you your type really doesn't like at all for some reason but maybe it's just because you're old bye-bye hurts a little bit and also that fucking butt plug that I would bet $200,000 that you have shoved in your asshole right now time you think I think all the fucking time and I think it's like I think

<timemark seconds="9880" />

I get a Biggby DSM-5 from that too but that's just me I don't think it's true I don't know is it's just it's for a lot of people at unpalatable because it's so complex and we don't yet know how to do it but we live on a planet and you say this all the time where we are all people we are planetariums we are earthlink's right we happen to have been born into a country this country of that country some of these countries have big fucking walls around them because there's Prosperity inside that country and its Prosperity inside that country and there's not prosperity and other places and people are suffering there suffering bad bad bad bad suffering where it's like they're there is like they can't they can't live in some of these places without getting killed for sure the chance of them getting killed his wife or whatever reason they're just doing what any live

<timemark seconds="9940" />

organism dies they're trying to get to a better spot also mr. sessions you probably don't believe in it but once this fucking ice caps melt holy fuck when the cities in the next 50 years or so become inundated with water and people have to start moving more more more from places that are becoming uninhabitable I think that's going to happen to make a long date so what do we do Duncan we just open up the borders for everybody but I can tell you this if we start approaching this from the perspective of love which is the perspective of like we don't need to separate them from their kids and there might be a way to do this the easy as their suffering a little bit more I don't know what it is but from looking at what you're doing right now and I think we can do it better I don't know what it is but I think if we get a lot of people together and really think about it and figure it out I'm not talking redistribution of wealth

<timemark seconds="10000" />

or some kind of crazy communist shit I'm just saying I know for sure we can do better than those God damn aluminum blankets you're putting on those fucking kids get a guitar player get some beds in here is there a way to like you know there's just all kinds of shit we could do I think that's better what would that help though so you play the guitar is that really going to have that same play the guitar regression problem that worked I'm sure they migrate your problem will be solved I'm just saying that the current methodology seems to be a little more sadistic that needs to be that's all I don't know the answer I don't know what the answer is but I do not work converging is a species and I would imagine that is technology continues to connect as we're going to be transcending nationalities in a way that aren't going to be palatable to people

<timemark seconds="10060" />

like honestly like I'm not Jeff sessions anymore me now me what would you do me right because I don't really I don't understand the issue at 11 deep enough right so can I just say like one there's many it's a complex situation there's not one to ride just let anybody in who's not a criminal

<timemark seconds="10089" />

she asked how do we detect that way to have some sort of faith in the records so we would have to help the record-keeping so really want the really the way to do it correctly is first of all anyone is attached to us whether it's Mexico or Canada make sure they're okay make sure that they are viable and stable and help them that's the real thing treat them as if there are colony in the United States there in like not that they're not sovereign that they're still Mexico but like treat them like they are connected to us and we don't want them to be fucked up and crazy said a building up a wall make it so that nobody wants to come over here like that seems to be the prosperity way to go about it like to say Hey you know Mexico's fucking beautiful all right is a reason why people vacation in Mexico it's fucking amazing okay you go to Punta Mita or fucking Puerto Vallarta or Cabo or Tulum

<timemark seconds="10149" />

looking beautiful as beautiful and also dangerous and scary and filled with crime that's fucking stupid right so then you would go with the problem here is drugs illegal drugs are illegal in the United States wants to buy a bunch of drugs are these people making billions dogs on drugs and you got to send the message you got to hang people from fucking Bridges and shit yeah you got to do things to send a message that you're ruthless and you had to get that money and there's a lot of that going on in Daddy's no different than Al Capone during the fucking prohibition of alcohol in the United States of America the same goddamn thing you make something illegal that everybody wants and only criminals are willing to sell it and so we're stuck next to a thriving criminal economy with no management of it whatsoever other than bullets

<timemark seconds="10209" />

stronger and El Chapo digs a fucking hole a mile through the ground gets out of jail again but this is what we're next to and so instead of saying hey we should be saying is what do we have to do to not just fix Mexico. Just help them and get come up with some sort of strategy and a plan to build them up almost fucking poor neighborhoods we got to fix these fucking neighborhood have been drenched in poverty syndrome 1920s how to fix them fix some Halliburton hires people to fucking rebuild shit we blow up in Iraq they should be hiring people but I can figure out how to develop Community Center so the kids have somewhere to go there they going to learn to be productive so you developing last losers and dreams giving them things they can put their energy to that make them feel good about life right give them skills and and and game

<timemark seconds="10269" />

steak and Plex and things they could do what I get good at what they develop self-esteem which is one of the most terrible things about growing up and impoverished crime-ridden gang-infested neighborhood as you feel like you're nothing you are nothing your wife can be taken away at any moment you'll be careful where you go who was the flying people getting killed people killing people over words and insults and fucking territory for drugs and your aunts on crack in your uncles and now it's just seems like there's no fucking hope and no one does anything about it a lot of people dedicated to it but it's the top of the organization is looking at this big thing to say they're all going hey we got to drill more hey we got hit with a resource is the resources. What about our greatest resource human beings it again it's to have less losers do it have less losers is you got to find the spots that are sick and healed them

<timemark seconds="10329" />

poverty and crime and violence edit existed for as long as we can think for decades fix them fix them and have a concerted effort to fix them and doing bring everybody together and instead of the saddest idea that we're all separate and fucking two party right left nonsense is Civil War and Trump supporters in and people want to kick people out of restaurants, we all realize that if we're going to treat each other as Americans we're going to agree that we're on this team we don't start acting like team that's it let's let's find Common Ground instead of always searching for the negative and things instead of reinforcing ridiculous ideas because you know that that's what your team supports like I see a lot of people online talking about this immigrant issue when did either don't have kids or they don't think you could happen to their kids there I just hurt shooting the fucking come over here you can those other people

<timemark seconds="10389" />

you were in the presence of a woman who came over here from Guatemala and she's poor and she's starving and they're taking her baby away and she's wailing and screaming from a primal a primal place in hurt her DNA that the one thing she loves more than anything is being taken away a baby if you if that doesn't freak you the fuck out you're not a part of the team and you're missing it you're missing it what's what are we here for we here for a hundred years of whatever that's over here for you want to spend a hundred years ago and I don't want you on the team you're an asshole right and I'll give you I don't give a fuck if your right or left I don't care if you're contagious or I don't care if you're an atheist if that's what you support you are an asshole we don't want you on our team okay so what if you agree with certain economic policies that I don't agree with and we can have a discussion about it we can figure out why you agree and we can figure out why people are allowing all this money to get into politics why do we allow

<timemark seconds="10449" />

all these special interest groups and lobbyists to interfere with our laws and have our politicians and create all this shit that we don't want you can't just throw it on mine you can't just vote in South one-person-one-vote it's the Electoral College and there's a lot of checks and balances that replace it's all wonderful and groovy but it's not giving the trust of the people I trust the people that are there informed they can make their own decisions that more people should be able to make the decision that 28 year old girl who who who won in New York 28 year old Democratic whether I agree with her or not and I don't know if I do or don't I bet I agree with her on a lot of things I think education should be free I think we should figure out a way we can pay for bombs we can pay for school this I think that this idea that everybody should have health care is great idea who the fuck wants people to not be healthy who wants people to be hurt and not be able to fix it who wants what are you really saying that struggling people should have to pay exorbitant amounts of money to get fixed when we can maybe

<timemark seconds="10509" />

chip in and help members of our team that stupid bitch in your parents are dead piece of shit he said people on our team about people who are a lazy good-for-nothing loser is mooching off the system you can have that too we got to figure out how to educate people so that that happens if that's what you got to do it you just described that mean that is it I don't know what to call that thing you just talked about but like that's happening everywhere that's what just happened in the United States at the global shift the tapping have you did you see the video when she found out she want it's amazing it's like one of the realest moments and look people that angry 20 year old she know what she doesn't know she'll learn. What's going on?

<timemark seconds="10569" />

10 term and come back and that he expect 10 to 1 verse on her how much money she spent 10 to 1 in Grassroots if that can happen to she's a kid yeah. And she's pretty she's a pretty young 20 year old we watch this watch this shit when she wins plays it

<timemark seconds="10601" />

should they go and look you know I don't know if Democratic socialism is the answer but I know it's a part of the conversation and this is the thing that was locking out any ideology in this team as part of the conversation what is democratic socialism entail but what does it entail all this the market will take care of care of itself bullshit I think there's a certain amount of us we have to chip in to the community pile how efficient and good is the community pile are they bunch of lazy constant Community Pie or there is their waist and nonsense and bullshit Chinese people that have those jobs you were talking about earlier there to slow down slow down I know you could do this to me hours but you can get an 8 hour day out of this community pile is is is taking care of it and and managed in a in a an honest and trustworthy and great for all

<timemark seconds="10661" />

volved and beneficial to the community and and supportive of Community Values and love in this idea that were on a team that you're going to be okay did you break your leg Duncan hey you're going to be okay and we make fun of Canada tell Karen it's not the best it's not the best guy friends my friend Jen she broke her fucking me she had to get a ACL reconstruction the kind of botched it and had to go back in and fix it again should wait forever it's not the best but it's there it's something and it may be that can be improved I may be improving that is better let me try this again so have options but I also believe in options for people to do it better like the surgeons that you can get in the United States like there's a guy dr. gettleman to go fix my knee he's a fucking wizard this guy's really got good there's a lot of pro athletes I mean he did a great fucking job reconstructing mind he's an artist I don't think it's anything wrong with someone like that getting paid more I think someone's I think LeBron James should get paid more for playing basketball then me if I was playing basketball I shouldn't you pay as much gas just fucking way better

<timemark seconds="10721" />

yeah I think that there's a there's that with doctors as well I think with everything is well but I think that it's a lot like there's a lot of people that are state-funded prosecutors are or a defense attorneys you know where the where the people can't afford it and you know you get what is that called what's hungry very good at it there were going to put in their time in the public sector or doing it for you for the public defender in there eventually go on to maybe maybe even not do that maybe they just did they get satisfaction out of helping people that don't have any money doesn't mean you shouldn't have high price floors as well that doesn't mean that people shouldn't be able to pursue excellence and be rewarded for that excellent to be able to do whatever the fuck they want with it but they want to be charitable that money or they want to be selfish with that money if they're pursuing excellence and through their Excellence they did they manage to a mass and extreme amount of wealth

<timemark seconds="10780" />

guitar whatever the fuck they do is not wrong with that either we just got to stop thinking there something wrong with that but

<timemark seconds="10785" />

chipping in and everybody putting it to the company pop is in a sense some form of Socialism right like we agree on some kind of socialism like is it when you consider like the fire department the police department of public social things right we put money into it it's not a total redistribution of wealth like deciding how much rich people should but it is deciding you got a chip in we all got a chip in everybody's got a chip that you still feel like the chip in it is good we still like it's all fucked up which is a bunch of brownies out there like this Jeff sessions got this fucking dumb and all these fucking people that are robbing the system with their 2-hour delay today jobs that they're stretching out to 8 hours that build resentment it's poor management and salsa listless and they have these are not valuable jobs and I like like a job that is commands the same sort of attention is some of the more attractive jobs at people seek out

<timemark seconds="10845" />

it's all the true I just think it's it's what people think is let's wait for the government to do this and that's where I think the problem is like instead of thinking like okay yeah that's true that's like figure out a way to get more taxpayer money out of the military industrial complex out of the prison and let's put it in the neighborhoods that needed let's get it to funding education all of that is is really beautiful but it's still and you want to vote and make all that happen Grassroots movements all of it but also think of the term socialism right just what is it so it's like you don't have to wait for the state to come and start figuring out ways to tax people to make that pile of money happen like this is this is where I think it's an interesting thing to start exploring the idea of like intentional communities I'm not saying starting a community thing

<timemark seconds="10905" />

you can actually push your friendship group to the next level like it doesn't just have to be a random group of friends who knows each other like you can start that pile of opulence with a group of friends where it's like you know what I mean a group of friends can just agree with each other like hey man just so you know you're not going to be homeless I got you I'm not going to fucking give you money all the goddamn time and if you like you know if you're like it's a you don't even have to say any of this shit except hey this is your address right that's what you and I did when you moved in with that I know Joe I know man and it don't forget about that sometimes the that kind of thing which is what I'm saying is like everyone right now

<timemark seconds="10960" />

and I understand where I'm at but to me there seems to be something demonic about the public fixation on the state it's like the state is this like dragon and it's like. Like it's a it's a Daddy it's a Daddy what it's a multi-armed daddy with a bunch of fucking laser pointers that it's got the entire population watching like cats running around right now we're all like all God they did that oh my God he did that all my God they did that people when will this change when will this change your phone's ringing guess who's your dad when was the last time you talked to your dad 3 months ago call your fucking dad back the whole time you're like

<timemark seconds="11005" />

the whole time you're neglecting your family in your neighborhood walking down the street looking at your phone about that guess what you're walking by dude you're walking by fucking plastic bottles piles of fucking trash 3 fucking meth addicts and some fucking woman who just a got beaten by your husband is not living on the streets for the last couple of weeks and you've got fucking $40,000 in the bank account liquid

<timemark seconds="11038" />

I like saying to the Garden you can touch yes you can touch and do it an organized way and then like maybe you have a garden you can touch this giant I think about that think about what you've done during this podcast and then some of the things that you've said you basically touched an enormous garden show me easy way to do it cuz I'm a yappy motherfuker I'm talking about like no in your life too but that counts too I think it does count but I think that it would be easy to do things like that and in an in still forget about something that's really basic which is now that I'm talking about this shit I'm thinking to myself

<timemark seconds="11081" />

right now like in my neighborhood I'm thinking like wait a minute wait what am I not doing I don't know what it is yet but I guarantee there's something that I could do and I like that man because you know like

<timemark seconds="11096" />

tithing to the church yes to me. I think we may have talked about this before but I get it now but like it always seem like a really boring do it like you the plate comes by throw some money and you don't get goes to church stuff you don't know but the idea of tithing I think there's something to it which is like if you just kind of look at your income and you think alright 5% of this shit is going to get spent or 10% or whatever you're comfortable with I'm putting that in a pile and that pie is going to helping people in my neighborhood or my friends are my family and I'm just going to give that away and I think there's something to be said for that because right now I think we were a little too fixated on the daddy State helping us and I think it's more important that we start helping each other forming communities with that that are based on Love and Friendship

<timemark seconds="11156" />

and just figured out some of the communities are going to fail a couple of artists and trick everybody or lazy people but the main thing is like let's start thinking in terms of organizing into communities that aren't based on a fixation on the government right now and then let's see what happens

<timemark seconds="11177" />
