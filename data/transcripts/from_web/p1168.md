<timemark seconds="540" />

The Joe Rogan Experience

<timemark seconds="548" />

the Lost Art of knife making it still alive too awesome awesome nice for me but this one is one I use all the time that I post on Instagram that people freak out as we're talking about for the podcast attacks has meteor in it meteorite what's meteors a big one meteorites a little one said the idea to know you Liz is a very special kind of Steel that very few people can actually manufacture on a small scale in the world and that was made by my shop meet Peter forsberg and so is

<timemark seconds="597" />

the meteorite is kind of a l a small elements in the whole Matrix because most meteorite is all nickel or all iron or something like that and this one particularly is a lot of nickel and some Cobalt and if you're going to make it by actual usable steel out of it you can't really use a whole lot of it in the overall mixture so is there any meteorites that are made out of all Iron definitely have to find them just gotta find the ones I don't know where is it can you just take them like when they land is it yours if you find it hey bro so small that they've by the time they get here hit the actual Earth's surface that completely disintegrated or burned up so it's the really massive ones and this was part of

<timemark seconds="657" />

impact I think in South America it's just crazy to think that this is a piece of space in their dope pattern I'm really in the craftsmanship man of I always have been I love handmade pool cues and this desk just a handmade desk and I feel like it's one of the things that I really appreciate in this modern digital world and I also feel like unfortunately it may be one of the things that slipping away technology Technologies been great for us in a lot of different ways but in doing all those things actually is taking us away from really creating and working with our hands and so like this whole like

<timemark seconds="717" />

farm-to-table movement of people using growing their own vegetables chicken stuff is coming from having like first-hand contact with that just having that relationship in general with it brings so much more value to the overall experience of eating those Azor using that knife or sitting and it seems like a fairly recent movement in that direction right like it feels like things got so digital that people like whoa whoa whoa what the Facebook and the fucking Instagram I want I want a wood table I want to saw this been to myself yeah I don't want it to be plastic I want real stuff and there's something about handmade things whether it's a handmade pair of boots are handmade bag like that dislike the something about things that are made by hand that people get it like a deep appreciation of price for sure

<timemark seconds="777" />

so kind of goes back to like I was saying like at this technology is Advanced we've kind of grown away from these kind of what's considered like blue collar work kind of work but I think people really are driven by a sense of achievement and when you're doing data entry that literally millions of people and fucking monkeys can be trained to be like

<timemark seconds="802" />

it took to be able to go into a craft into and have a hands-on experience is very very very very different in that sense of achievement even when somebody comes out of something and maybe I taught a class on how to make a nice and it looks like a fucking turd they're going to think it looks like the most beautiful fucking like they've ever seen in my life because their hands and their Creative Touch their and they're their sweat and probably some of their beside is put into creating that thing and that brings that much more value to it that's an issue with people today that have jobs they don't feel a very for fillings if there's no real thing at the end where is like if you make a table at the end when you were putting the final sanding on the final you know layer of stain and you're looking at it like I fucking made this so yes is a real thing that I can touch that I made just like human beings in our current form we have a deep connection to making things physical things in the flu and end

<timemark seconds="862" />

and appreciation for things that people have made whether it's a rifled somebody made or a knife or you know a hammer or that's that's someone's made there's something about that that we we just have a real appreciation for me you can buy at a knife from the store that's made in a shot at work you know some knife is made and some Mass manufacturing process it'll work and it's fine I mean you would appreciate it if you want appreciate it like I appreciate this thing like every time I take this out of my super careful with it and you know and then the handle the handles made out of this is a moose antler and Elk antler right there at the top of the Moose the bottom conversation or listen to your conversation with Guy Ritchie and you brought up that it there was I think it was carbon dated to 5400 years old Jays essentially it's been sunk in a bog

<timemark seconds="922" />

what's the other night that you made for me that has a handle it's all go to get ahold of people for their job was Raising logs out of the box so that's happening all over the world and some of that stuff are these ancient laws that it's the right conditions where the tree falls over it just sits there and Steep and that's a big thing for about two shafts Lakewood shafts they do like to take these logs out of the bottom like Lake Michigan or something and then they dry it all out and then they make Shams out of it and there's something about it being in the bottom of the water for so long it does something to the to the way they feel when you got there Jamie that's ancient bogwood Artisan dice

<timemark seconds="982" />

oh I'm Dungeons & Dragons yeah that's a that's a nerd shit right there are Sonic super polished up the other school what would that was the only for a game right you wouldn't play dice dice

<timemark seconds="999" />

three C's are all kinds of different actually like value holders for the most part value holder so the countdown with a 16 15 20 whatever you understand Dungeons & Dragons you might be a dork my brother-in-law Magic the Gathering super people that get kicked out of the Dungeons & Dragons It's a different generation of beautiful handle that kids in Montana really good guy he's a nice kid met him a couple years ago and and Eugene actually go there every Embassy to show Jamie that's bog Oak that some other like big chunks of it that they pulled out while Inter-Community of these knife-making

<timemark seconds="1059" />

people yeah there are quite a few people who have started getting into the knife making the world kind of handcrafted Hand Forged knives kind of started back in the 70s and it was a stand-off from things a Custom Knife making Association makers Association and then it sends off to ABS which is American bladesmith society that was all about the forge blade and kind of the mission to retain knowledge and history and skills that go into actually taking a piece of metal and forging a blade out of it like your blades they were forged to shape they approach is to just take a bar Stihl tree saw the line cut that out the forging aspect

<timemark seconds="1119" />

especially if somebody doesn't actually know what they're doing there just like heating up a piece of Steel don't know how fucking hot it is getting they don't know how when to stop hitting it then maybe hitting it too cold they might be overheating it and hitting it while it's way too hot they could really actually detrimental damage to the to the material and turn out a piece of shit so the Rings kind of anesthetic and kind of a depth of story to help bring kind of more to that product and crafting something from a you know I'm just a piece of metal that you bought you put all the pieces together and polish it down sanded it what did you get into this

<timemark seconds="1164" />

so I'm kind of a funny story so I got into this back in 2008 is when I met Bob Kramer at the time I was working in a restaurant actually in my hometown of Olympia and I was going to restaurant I was writing as an assistant salsa dancing instructor and doing and I was 24 and I didn't know what the hell I was doing with myself and I didn't really have much of a direction in my life I was terrible at school you know I had maybe 40 credits toward towards an AA but I don't even have in like an actual certification and degree of any kind started working for this guy. And she's like oh you should meet him he's really interesting you know you kind of feel like you're lost he's been all over the world if he's even like he was at one point and it's about grammar

<timemark seconds="1223" />

he was a clown I think for a year for Ringling Barnum Bailey and from what I understand it was a great experience and he loved it and anyways she's like you know I think you guys would hit it off I think maybe she could help the stove some wisdom as to where you're at and so I met up with him that I was actually working at and fish and chips and bullshiting opportunity I go but he was anticipating an article coming out in the New Yorker like in a month that was going to really like blow his shit up and he had had a couple big articles like in Civil War magazine and he was featured in the I cook still Illustrated at one point and each time like there's a huge influx and so I think him and part of anticipation for that he is

<timemark seconds="1284" />

look you seem like a nice guy you don't really seem to have a direction maybe we could work something out I can't make any promises to you that I have full time work for you so he just took you on as an apprentice essentially I saw a video with him with Anthony Bourdain that's how I found out about him he was making a knife with meteors right with a piece of meteorite in it as well same kind of thing and I'm thinking like wow crazy is this disguise hammer in this thing together and put in that that was like one of the ways that I got interested in Custom Knife making sure always had knives pocket knives you know the other night and I was like kind of thought they were cool and enjoy them but until I watch that video I I didn't realize that there was a lot of people out there there it is him and Anthony I didn't realize there was a lot of people that are out there doing this from scratch and then you know then I was like and then I saw your page on Instagram

<timemark seconds="1344" />

I remember thinking wow this guy does some wild shit and I don't remember how you and I got to chatting I don't remember I just remember seeing your stuff on Instagram Joe Rogan I like that was in the email was it Instagram message not sure my email in one of your previous conversation but I was like your picture for the emails like this Goofy picture of you doing like kissy face or something like that but y'all are just crazy and it's doing this crap appreciation for the actual like the actual work that goes into it and

<timemark seconds="1404" />

appreciating that value has been it you know I like even 5 years ago when I first started under my own brand there's no way it would have thought I'd be sitting here hanging out with you guys is kind of a crazy right for me that's crazy right for me to man all of it is life's crazy I believe like I said I've always had a deep appreciation for Artisans you know where for art but I think that I think you're nice making is Art me never I really do like look at this is James pull up an image from your website that shows this incredible blade Design This is what I know like is that Damascus steel zyro that is just a quick note this is actually a post that I did to celebrate another maker his name is Julian you can actually see it there on the right margin The Blaze the blaze that you made that you have here today that you had that you bring them with you for an auction those the patterns on those things are

<timemark seconds="1463" />

fucking insane how do you do that like how do you make these cuz it's not just steal for people that are just listening to this like that one is a great example I would really love for people who are just listening to just please go go back to the page Amy so I can see the headline

<timemark seconds="1485" />

chick gets stuck what you mean you can't shrink it what happened all the touchpad these God damn old ass laptop there m a u m a s fire Arts & M a s s i m a u m a s i a fire Arts my Massey fire Arts mau mau mau ASI fire Arts if you go there that's his page you'll be able to check it out and Order books are closed your fact that border Canada overwhelming Point problem for the overwhelming because it's

<timemark seconds="1545" />

on top of all time construction crazy like long waiting list Man 3 years for people actually wait longer than that same thing with the pool cue world famous pool cue manufacturers like Southwest or sugar tree and they have 10 you're waiting list and it's just because they do it right it takes a long time everything's done by hand therefore highly sought-after and because of that like you could buy a pool cue from you know a company that makes them through you know computerize process and they're fine they played really good just like a knife that you'd buy from a store that's not me know made by machine and saw done Mass Manufacturing

<timemark seconds="1605" />

it'll cut your meat and it works great the machine made that it's beside trips me out everytime I tell this little something that people leave in things that they make me and there really is I mean I'd I think it exists and everything that people My Brother's clothing or jewelry or furniture or anything let me to think there's a little something that people leave when they in in the thing that they make there's something you talk about Mike passed down through genes like watch out for this plan to watch out for this predators of shit like I like passing something on like that kind of in a way like where I'm toiling over something like that for you know 40 dedicated solid fucking hours making sure it's as perfect as I possibly can.

<timemark seconds="1665" />

I think there's something to that I mean I even if it's just a thought even if you just know when you touch it like if I touch this knife I know that you made this you know when I'm when I'm cutting something with this I'm cooking I know that you made this so maybe it's just even if it's only in my head it's still it just feels different you know and I don't know I mean there's stairs Rupert sheldrake Hussain exactly kind of scientist is but he has his bizarre Theory and he's a really interesting guy to talk to so I would never discount it he thinks that everything has memory he thinks you just use can access that memory but he thinks those things that have memories and he thinks that our idea that memory is something that only animals and humans possess is this is just it's probably not true and that that's probably one of the reasons why people don't want to buy a house where someone was murdered at a haunted house even if it's not real

<timemark seconds="1725" />

ghost like maybe that home has memories you know baby I like my dad went to Gettysburg and he's not woohoo he's like as fucking straight-laced across the board no bullshit as it gets and he said man you could feel sadness there he goes he's think of how many thousands of people died at Gettysburg and he said when you were there I just feel sad like you feel bad after yeah I don't know if that's real or if it's maybe the knowledge that you have that there was a war there mean I don't know I used to do the same where I would walk through cemeteries just interested like looking at people's names in like when when did they live and what other people have to say about them or what you know what's up and just walking through cemeteries like sometimes I would even do it on Halloween to track my ass up and it is definitely feels weird in there

<timemark seconds="1785" />

it's a run through him because I would want to be reminded that life is short get something done make something happen anymore but the thing about cemeteries like 30 dead when they get in there but the memory thing is like a boat someone gets murdered on that boat you're in the boat and you like fucking freaking out and do something about it like seems like if you had a thing you had a wallet that Mike Tyson owned you know what I mean you could hold it like that you know there's something to it morphic resonance okay that's Rupert sheldrake Theory

<timemark seconds="1828" />

quantum theory developed by Rupert sheldrake British biologist paranormal influence by which a pattern of events behavior Can facilitate subsequent occurrences of similar patterns of that's right that is that is not about it memory that is does his other theory is referred to an olive a lot of the other ways about memory isn't here in nature and yeah yeah I think that's part of it like I think what I was talking about us part of his theory of morphic resonance but morphic resonance I think he's here yeah it's here it says that all that scroll back to the process whereby self organizing systems inherit a memory from previous similar systems so when he was talking about with morphic resonance was how mice if they learn I say if you have a pattern and there's like cheese at the end of this pattern and they go through a maze if one Mouse figures out that pattern other Mouse can figure it out quicker

<timemark seconds="1884" />

and there's something somehow or another they learn from each other and when chimpanzees were observed using tools other chimpanzees on the other side of the world started mimicking that behavior without any interaction with those chimpanzees at all yea yea yea very strange more intense than Butterfly Effect cuz it applies if there's some sort of collective information pool that they're sharing Through The Ether that there's some something that they're they're sharing through some unknown method is crazy

<timemark seconds="1925" />

it's it's actually been shown that there is some sort of a there's something to this and there's a lot of criticism of it so you're one of those people right now that's like a materialistic screaming out I got it I got it someone is a real rational ask who just wants only science provable the thing is it is kind of provable because there is there is there has been some tasks and there's Fierce opposition to this which is anything that has like some woo woo attached to its going to have some Fierce opposition the roofer was a really fast

<timemark seconds="1959" />

and he's also a rare scientist that he he he he was he was Christian is that what it was is really into he has a certain level of Christianity that he accepts adopt 60 feels like it's beneficial to him very interesting guy and there's a mathematician and Terence McKenna who's the other gentleman was the trialogues they have these fantastic recordings it was sheldrake McKenna and one other guy was also brilliant and it would go back and forth they had these Ralph Abraham Abraham Abraham's or Abraham Abraham and the they did these the series of talks and this is one of the things that came up like McKenna was the most woo woo Ralph Abraham was the least woo woo and she'll

<timemark seconds="2019" />

check was kind of in the middle interesting stop of our friends psychedelic Salon I think Lorenzo has them are they available online damn it was that is the case that's got removed yes it was probably selling it it's really cool though you know you get to see these guys in the 1990s pre-internet

<timemark seconds="2057" />

what's a pre internet might not have been it might be like 98 I think McKenna died around 2000 ish

<timemark seconds="2066" />

he died post to one side C. Like 2003 or something

<timemark seconds="2072" />

when did he die

<timemark seconds="2075" />

I'm asking this this is all about memory and things since we went on the fucking deep Road off of the woods here but anybody's listening yeah so you made it to watch UK and then he kicked the bucket anybody who's just interested in really cool conversations it's something to listen to free super smart dudes kind of debating ideas bouncing around off each other recordings of I use Grant reading Joseph Campbell like

<timemark seconds="2114" />

yeah I know just absorbing it and trying to figure out what that means to me today so much cooler

<timemark seconds="2138" />

I like a meditative space was a meditation led by Alan Watts from like no one fuck it like 60 70s and just the way he explained it never made sense how meditation should when he's like don't try to not think of anything but just accept them that this is there and but also ignore them at the same time totally like I felt like I was above myself watching me just sitting there listening to this recording is it true why you such a headache the sound of his voice and just hearing his thoughts when you when you hear a really deep thinker like him one of things it does is kind of gets you into that pattern of thought and you realize like all I can probably kind of sort of think that way too I just allow myself to be guided by his words and so to try to pay attention to how he's doing this now he was an interesting guy because not just was he a deep thinker but he is

<timemark seconds="2198" />

the influences of those people it's it's very different like there's very few recordings even back then for them to listen to you know this stuff was based on reading and their education and their actual life experiences so they were very unique and original they were really cornerstones for a lot of these deep philosophical ideas you know I'm so that when you hear an Alan Watts recording today you know maybe something like me or some other people to listen to that damn I might share those ideas or reflect on those ideas but clearly these are not my idea Caesar ideas that have come from these intense Cornerstone people whether it's McKenna Alan Watts or some like that do you get a chance while you're when you working do you listen to shed or do you just I got all the time to sit in headphones

<timemark seconds="2258" />

and they have like this memory foam memory foam earbud tips so that helps to reduce the amount of noise it's actually coming in so it helps protect it that way just kind of in general like a normal in inner ear plug would work but also because it's reducing the amount of noise is getting in you can also listen at a lower volume so you're not like blowing out your ears to be able to hear whatever you listening to right it's so loud in your shop so much whenever I'm working by the shop and they want to see they're just curious and so we have stuff going on or we can heat some steel up real quick and do a quick demonstration usually I don't take the time to throw all that stuff in it is so loud I actually feel like my hearing has become more sensitive since I started making knives than it was before

<timemark seconds="2317" />

sharing is always protect and so I feel like it's become more sensitive I'm a better sense of humor I don't know if that's possible to get your hearing back or whatever but protecting it's doing better because of that yeah I just I hear a lot of things like all the things that feels like whenever I take my hearing protection out I'll be at home or something and looks at me like I'm crazy I'm so why don't you ask someone if like maybe if I can. People don't use their hands and then the hands get soft

<timemark seconds="2351" />

I don't know I got you something you can't gain it back but you might be protecting it longer have a sensitivity issue maybe since it's quieter all day so if you blow it out for my concerts and she like that that's it that's all you can do what about follicle threat vibrating blow that shit out they haven't synthetically made those yet home yet I feel so bad for those old rock stars that didn't know any better and now they they just fucking Lewis it's all happened to him he all the sudden that's the Lord's work

<timemark seconds="2392" />

just kidding just kidding you a tip to be square the dude from my ACDC who else is gone yeah fucking everybody's going deaf

<timemark seconds="2406" />

yeah they also probably didn't protect themselves and then you should have nobody know any better back then it's an older one but this woman she progressively got different different she Grew Older until like I think she's in high school or something in like she was like practically completely deaf but she's a percussionist and she's like a world-renowned percussionists there's a awesome document is called touch the sound and she hears through her body which is a trips me out but the tones that she's able to achieve the control she has over everything and whatever kind of instrument she's playing it's awesome. But she has almost everything is everything through her body

<timemark seconds="2456" />

too so it's kind of interesting to think like if Angus can figure that shit out then I mean he's holding the fucking thing is to see who's the what's the lead singers name fox's name second lead singer

<timemark seconds="2474" />

Brad Johnson and what kind of CTE does that guy have I mean fucking Christ you shouldn't be doing that because you're talking to me about that the other day yeah I was thinking like all through high school like I played football from 7th grade all through high school and like all the stuff they're learning now I'm just like Jesus was happening to me to see TV kinds of fucked-up you know I definitely had some serious concussion I'm sure and sometimes it scares me what does that mean it should hold you now it's scary you know you're lucky stop when you did I know I know a lot of people with brain damage me to

<timemark seconds="2534" />

I'm sure I have some I guaranteed I must mean I don't think anybody rides for free I think you get hit in the head enough you got some brain damage you know I got in the head on a regular basis for most most of my younger years for my 15 till like 22 I got hit in the head all the time is just

<timemark seconds="2558" />

nobody know any better you know it back then you thought that like once you got like once you're slurring your words and stuff if you just stopped like he's a little Punchy should stop. That's how people thought but didn't realize that it's regressive and then like you needed a really show brain damage like 10 years after the initial injury site that's when you really start showing damage so some some CTE just compounds it until it just becomes unmanageable for these poor people

<timemark seconds="2589" />

yeah I actually I can't especially after watching concussion and and seeing and reading my articles about the real life people that the shift happened to I like I have a hard time watching football and like I used to watch football time I've never been like crazy in the sports knowing all the stats numbers of a good contest I never really rude for anybody but now when I see you like even kids signing the draft or signing up from high school to go to a certain College on my man that somebody's fucking baby I would support kids fighting way before I would support kids doing football and both of them I'd be nervous about and you know I mean there's other stuff like X Games type shyt glitter into extreme sports in the people that are in a snowboarding snowboarders wipe out all the time and cracked her head open

<timemark seconds="2643" />

what time can you get a scholarship and martial arts of any kind of solid just wrestling and I took a big that's a big driver right there though right most important martial arts yeah that's it I mean Judo maybe is there school that has Judo these that boxing in schools I mean in back in like 50s and 60s and ship there was boxing was a legitimate sport college but not anymore I can't really watch it anymore I mean you have to be careful like with your hand-eye coordination and your fingers and shit now she's you know I mean you got to think like when you're working with hammers and hot metal and you you must always have to be super wet does everybody that works in a machine shops missing at fingertip Rock something's fucked up

<timemark seconds="2697" />

spikeball lucky little thing is one of the most dangerous things cuz it catches and eats the blade bites into that is a hand and just rips it flings it wherever I throw knives right back but it is reality I've actually been a lot of work to get away from using buffers because of that and I'm still like doing great work I just I have a lot of friends who just will never touch a fucking buffer wow what is a buffer look like for people don't know put up like what would you call it and then you shine like a benchtop thing like a bench grinder usually has like it with the hard round Stone wheel on one side that at that's it right there

<timemark seconds="2757" />

make me nervous that looks like something so if you fucked up when you got that blade to close and I'll kick it and then so it's it made from a that type of rope but little the ones that are the most dangerous are the softer cotton Wheels because they want to grab that much easier they have more give and what's interesting is I've actually been Cutlass

<timemark seconds="2786" />

working in a in a metal shop than I ever did working in and burn less than I ever did working in kitchens I worked in restaurants back a house like for 7 years collectively and most of that has to do with other people not calling like hot coming across but I can I turn around they don't call it I've been around there there with this fucking saute pan right in the side of my arm I'm ready fucking drop brat but it's being in a metal shop like you said you do have to pay so much attention you have to be focused at what you're doing because literally everything and I fucking shop wants to hurt you or kill you the second you're not paying attention to the second you're not paying attention it's going to grab you would like to hear horror stories of people working next to machines they have long hair rips it Scout

<timemark seconds="2846" />

who is that

<timemark seconds="2849" />

yeah poor bastard yeah I got Brian Wilson drill that he lost his hearing due to not putting in earplugs at a car race not music specifically he's there was a quote Brian Wilson from The Beach Boys Brian Wilson from The Beach Boys. I'm sorry this article has him at the top Ron Johnson well how the fuck does he know a mother fuckers in ACDC I think that's why I was running around stage so much too it's never an 11.30 long that's hilarious people are more susceptible just like some people more susceptible to CTE member Rhonda Patrick was talking about certain genes that you have

<timemark seconds="2907" />

what is an apropos I forget what it's called but whatever jeans that make you more susceptible more likely to get CTE from concussions problem probably makes sense now when you're in that shop and you're you're you're you're doing all this grinding sit is there any concern about chemicals like these are chemical ingestion or smells in the air it's like that cuz you're you're dipping things and you got all the stuff that use in its Airborne like an even going to your I'm almost always wearing a respirator oh wow especially when I'm grinding and it's like double can does it work does a respirator filter all of it and it's a huge difference

<timemark seconds="2959" />

we're at my facial hair right now even this little bit what you got even that little bit is enough to get through that so you have to shave your face smooth now how the fuck do you create those patterns like Damascus steel what it what is that on this doesn't have too much of your time does create those like that how do you do that we're looking at a crazy image that looks like it almost looks like someone drew on it this is a pattern I just came up with recently it's called for lack of better term but it just looks like a braid and it's something I've been wanting to create and how do you create a pattern welded Damascus the first off Damascus is kind of a blanket has become a blanket term traditionally in originally it actually referred to the steel that like the type of deal that your knife

<timemark seconds="3019" />

the meteorite knife is made from and it eventually became a blanket term for all kinds of kind of pattern Steel in general whether it's it occurs naturally or if it's kind of force in created the way that braid pattern was made so that pattern welded steel and so you have to start with at least two different types of high carbon steel idealease steals that heat treat in a similar ranged when you heat them up and squish on them they they move at a similar rate and so are most commonly people are working with 1080 and 15 and 20 those are just codes for two different types of high carbon steel to essentially you bring them up to high temperature you you squish him either under a big hammer or under press you can even actually do it by hand but you have to do kind of a smaller bill it to create the patterns and get it to stick to the trick is really getting on getting them close evenly squishing it out and

<timemark seconds="3079" />

like if you've ever like rolled out dough or anybody who's ever made like pastry dough like you would use in a croissant you tear open a croissant you see all those layers in there and that's from a Pisa dough being rolled out Ford or rolled out to end so it's kind of the same fucking thing but with metal that you have to have the kind of the right kind of temperature environment kind of you want as little oxygen in there as possible cuz the oxygen creates carbon

<timemark seconds="3110" />

are not carbon but iron oxide that help kind of is detrimental to creating solid weldbond and they're different ways to achieve that but once the 1080s the black steel the black 15 and 20 is that is the silver color in the what's the difference in the way those Steel's perform as one of them harder and more durable or more than Edgemoor they pretty much exactly the same effect chemically speaking they're almost exactly the same except for the 15 and 20 has high level of Glen 2% by volume by weight and so that steal is traditionally used in saw blades especially large big band saws you know like an organ there is like one of the oldest continuously running on wood Sawmill is still there and doing its thing with these giant bandsaw blades that are like 30 ft and that

<timemark seconds="3170" />

conference and they're like foot wide and there's monsters and foot wide you mean like sick from soccer so you're not wasting material are why to help those soccer so usually probably around 8:30 ish to a quarter of an inch thick but it's the same kind of idea is that their kid saw Brake Man there must be a fucking nightmare

<timemark seconds="3217" />

I've seen a few actually this one's from the 1500 check this shit out of a sick

<timemark seconds="3222" />

oh shit that it is the one that Mr and Neil deGrasse Tyson was posing with the other day

<timemark seconds="3228" />

yeah that's a real one that's an actual real samurai sword right right

<timemark seconds="3239" />

do you know when it was made exactly I don't think they know they just know it's from sometime. In the 1500s butter

<timemark seconds="3248" />

certificate of authentication that came with it explains

<timemark seconds="3253" />

just looking to see what the hormone activities phone is you can kind of see this line that runs parallel to The Cutting Edge and that usually indicates where the soft material stops and the hard material starts and so that I deal with these kind of the challenge with any is making a knife that takes and holds a sharp edge for good. Of time what's the key to that is also tough which means like you can drop it by on break so I give you wanted a hunting knife or something like that so just a few points will make a huge fucking difference longer what's the difference in the way that knife is made in this knife

<timemark seconds="3313" />

so they were brought up to like 1500 gries people don't not listen listening not watching this one of these knives is a hunting knife that doesn't feel better when it's great I love it but it's all it's made very similar if you look into the the video of it that handles the same and it looks it looks very similar as a different knife card that was pretty cool

<timemark seconds="3344" />

the garden keep that keeps your hand from sliding up the handle to it's an interesting handle curves and everything directions to the first question I'm sorry I make it hard and then you put it back into heat below much lower temperature to kind of toughen it up and so you're pulling some of that harness back so they were hardened the same way but they were tempered at different temperatures because one is a hard use knife while the chef's knife is not hardly what is the difference between a temper and what what does that mean so the temp so essentially 1500 degrees which is like an adult glowing orange color

<timemark seconds="3401" />

and then I dip it in a special oil that I have that's designed for quenching materials not just in knife-making but all kinds of different industrial applications I'm checking the oil sorry quenching oil what does that mean so that's cooling hot steel down in a very short. Of time depending on how the steel need to be treated you actually want to heat up the oil so that it's it's thinner and it also there's this thing that's called her jacket so if you've ever like the next to a wood-burning stove and you drop a little water on it and you see that beat water dance around on their the same thing happens on the surface of the blade set for the blade is the source of the heat right put it in that oil all that oil is dancing around on it so when it's the oils thinner

<timemark seconds="3457" />

it's not as large of a jacket because when that jacket is large so Jack and in casing that steal while it's trying to cool down it actually kind of acts as an insulator and ruin could potentially ruin so not only do you put it in the oil but you won't agitate it to kind of break up that jacket so it doesn't get a chance to just sit there and put all the way around the blade and it was cold it would if it sticker and so it would make a larger jacket actually and also that it probably wouldn't be as efficient I guess in cooling the steel down does ideal Lean Like for most steals you want to cool him down pretty much as quickly as you possibly can so they have to keep going I just going to say you and you essentially have depending on what kind of deal you working with you have anywhere from half a second

<timemark seconds="3513" />

to like 5 Seconds to get it from 1500 degrees or sometimes higher to below 800 Degrees

<timemark seconds="3523" />

and so this night would be more durable is that what it is then this knife durable yeah tougher so commonly refer to it as being tougher so we can withstand coming in Impact with bone you could chop with that thing a lot more efficiently with a tougher knife because this hasn't been tampered at it as as high of a temperature it's it's much harder than this one even though it's a few points those few points make a big difference and so if you were to take this out into the woods try to do the same job as this one to smack cutting it wouldn't necessarily but parts of The Cutting Edge would blow out probably blow and chips I actually recently just from time to time it's good practice as a knife maker to make sure that you're still doing your your heat treating stuff alright I take a knife and I just beat the shit out of it for such I threw some wood and then I actually took it to an antler and beat the shit out of it too and it's it is a

<timemark seconds="3583" />

raising that if things right you know ten thousands of an inch is enough to really to withstand impact of chopping through wood pretty well of course unless you're coming into contact with like super that's probably twice as thick as it actually needs to be wow this is crazy but it just comes down to the material not everybody a lot of people mistakenly think you know steel steel steel steel on whatever but they're not steel is made for many different applications and they're actually very specifically designed for those applications so like a structural steel this kind of stuff you know buildings are built out of very different from this it doesn't have very much carbon in it at all that way so the carbon is what helps make these really hard

<timemark seconds="3642" />

so lacking that carbon it is allows it to be way tougher so you can bend it all fucking day long so I got to snap exactly right so that's why you wanted for buildings in La where the earthquakes hit they wiggle a little bit now this is much thinner than a lot of other hunting knives would be

<timemark seconds="3664" />

which is interesting do with your use of this exotic metal and your your methods

<timemark seconds="3671" />

you're able to do that well and also part of the reason that you're able to do that is because it's high carbon steel has which means it has a high volume of carbon comparatively then other kinds of kinds of tool or Cutlery steel what's the benefit of high carbon versus less carbon kind of Crucible steel called woot's and so the patterning you seen there is actually strands of carbon carbide material so all the extra carbon floating around in The Matrix the iron Matrix of this steel jumps onto these bands called carbides and there are different elements and Vanadium is one of the elements in this deal that draws those carbon that carpet in so what you're seeing are thousands and thousands of all these ultra-hard carbon Vans floating around

<timemark seconds="3731" />

Plyometrics do you watch Game of Thrones I do when they have like swords are made out of valerian steel. You're pissed off but you fake magic steel the shit was fucking magical understand how did they learn mean what is the history of an object you know from back in the Roman gladiator days and not me how did they understand how to do this so this deal that they were using in Europe Japanese Swedish were pretty fucking good the Vikings and the greatest too barbaric time is it comes down to what they had available to them right so who was like the pioneer of like really durable badass sword material was it

<timemark seconds="3791" />

Japanese soup probably the Japanese and the Persians / Indonesian Persians so it could cut through silk floating in the air and shit like that why is that what did they do different so it's so the person steal is still very very very similar to these meteorite so it's a crew so it starts its call The Crucible steel and so essentially there's this clay jar essentially call The Crucible people melt all kinds of stuff in it but you can melt melt steel in it as well and so they were making these ingots of Crucible steel knife forging them out and they really really very heavily relied on these carbide van floating through the material because Unfortunately they didn't really have a very Advanced way of quenching that steal so that not only do they have the bands but they also had

<timemark seconds="3851" />

hard iron Matrix as well that those bands were floating in so they really relied on those that banding so the day just learn from trial and error of thousands of years of experimenting with different materials in different locations that got the iron from and different things at the added to it to make steel absolutely that's why I like you know you even watching Game of Thrones or other kind of medieval are movie set in medieval times you know there were very specific makers who were the best who could really make this shit happen and it's because they had a tradition passed down to them and all that stuff is very fictional but you had very specific lineages of people who had the you know essentially the most advanced technology and skills and techniques for creating the most highest performing

<timemark seconds="3908" />

Weaponry essentially of the time which was like the currency of the fucking time somebody went to Japan fairly recently and then filmed them working with a high-level sword maker for a television show

<timemark seconds="3923" />

trying to remember who was with someone famous that was really bad ass they they went to the sword maker shop and you know me and he's doing the whole thing like hammering it all out and and building a samurai sword from scratch the way it's always been got to do a little bit of digging to find them I actually just watched it like in The Last 5 Years I do not recall what they're going to make a samurai sword one of these days eventually just I mean I'm always going to do chest because that's what I know Mike that's the cool I know the most the biggest market right there's a reason why I let you know but if you think about it like I'm also made out of a meteor you know there's a lot of Mystique around Japanese swords

<timemark seconds="3983" />

as well as Viking swords but nowadays people have that shit made but you know it goes on a cooking knives are used like almost literally in every single household around the world every day right year-round is because of its ubiquity to our everyday life it lacks that mistake because we see the shit everyday I don't think much of it forces the Japanese sword people walk in here and they're like well I tell you one thing then when people come over my house and I'm cooking and they go where the fuck do you get that night that happens all the time when it's either this one or the other one when I show them the Bago Quan the same thing like dude I'm like yeah man check it out like this one or the other one that you made me the other hunting knife he may be out of Damascus which one is like tougher

<timemark seconds="4043" />

more durable so they've been heat treated to perform very very very similarly to really determine which one I prefer not to have to stick it in a bowl and try to break it it's not supposed to be but I mean every time I touched the blade I mean just think slices through things now there's got to be an art to actually sharpening things to write over sure and how do you know like the right angle to approach sharpening its I mean there are a lot of great information online La New York Austin there a Portland as well there is super reputable people not only who will offer service but usually offer lessons as well

<timemark seconds="4103" />

just like if you can't afford it you know you can dig around you can find the stuff online but it's not the same as having potentially having a coach next to you saying yeah that's great that's perfect that's where you want to be doing that shoe do you sharpen both sides I do so you sharpen the top and the bottom

<timemark seconds="4124" />

I'm sorry you mean a sides of the steel like would you sharpen it like this and then flip it over and stop and see things for people. Those one seem like a good knife the material is that those rods are made from so those are commonly referred to as sharpening rods or sharpening sticks but the reality is there not actually sharpening what are they doing so they're more accurately referred to as honing rods so what's happening at you if you have all these micro serrations essentially microscope and look at The Cutting Edge it looks like a saw blade but they're like they're fucking microns on Micron is a millionth of a meter like they're teeny tiny so but what happens

<timemark seconds="4184" />

normal use those teeth they they bend over the flex over sometimes they eventually wear out fall off and so the honing Rod does especially if they see showing right there

<timemark seconds="4202" />

ignore like the Long Street in you just like the tiny little things like yeah that's the shit right there,

<timemark seconds="4212" />

damn that's crazy

<timemark seconds="4215" />

observation beautiful view from the top so that's what's happening what happened to those tiny serration where it bent over like I was saying or break off and so but as we've been over and it's just normal that honing Rod by swiping across at home near on you don't just do it willy nilly like you got to do it at the right angle and all the stuff but what it does those teeth back into a line of people mistakenly call them sharpening sticks because all of a sudden there knife is sharp as fuck afterwards but the reality is that it's home those teeth back into alignment so I can do it again the leather strop so that's just a gentler way especially for things that are super super razor sharp which essentially event sharpen to really high finish

<timemark seconds="4275" />

I like 10000 grit For Hire so those micro serrations are even smaller which means they're even more delicate which we don't need as much force to realign I'm so horny Rod or a strop is that's a human hair Jesus Christ average human hair is about 3 thousandths of an inch

<timemark seconds="4304" />

well yeah to help with that a little bit more better perspective a 16th of an inch like a normal measurement 1/16 of an inch is 62.5 thousandths of an inch so that's like one I can't do one twentieth of a 16th of an inch

<timemark seconds="4328" />

crazy it's like split the hair literally a big debate in the world of bow hunting with broadheads with what kind of Steel to use and there's there's harder steel that some people use but it breaks and there is an issue with that and there's stairs like this big debate harder versus steel that is less hard but will bend more give slightly more you know and then there is there's a Broadhead that I use a carbon steel Broadhead from a company called G5 they make this Broadhead call the montec to pull up G5 carbon steel montec contact CS of the calm just what or is it even a driver hunting I'm the one yeah it is it's it it has

<timemark seconds="4388" />

the three points are four points but that's that's a carbon steel Broadhead that's what I shot my elk with last year with in that thing's virtually indestructible I put it up on my Instagram Instagram where I was fucking around with something on my bow at at full draw trying to set something in the ball went off and it hit a cement wall and it's stuck into the wall for solid solid cement wall and didn't kill the Broadhead I still have a broad head back there it's stuck into the Broadhead look at it did it stuck into the Broadhead shaft yeah look what it did to the to the arrow that will look at that you got brought in that fucking things got my Fit for Life. Things got my confidence forever cuz if that does that too

<timemark seconds="4448" />

concrete what will that do to Bone right now that will go through anything that's going to kick some ass things I would say geometry of the blades that the actual points they lend themselves similarly to have all your hunting knife sharpened differently from your chef's knife like the chef's knife materials but they're also sharpened at different angles because they have different jobs are supposed to do and so the broader sense of the more cute that is the more easily that will break as well as the sin of the material that that the geometry is living on is more susceptible to Breaking that first image that Jamie pulled up the geometry look like it was pretty robust tool that up again yeah it looks like it's probably at least 30 thousands of an inch thick which is no it's not more Broadhead in the without the

<timemark seconds="4509" />

yeah my friend Brian Stevens turn me on to these he he shot a bear through the head with one of those it was from 10 feet away it was coming at him and he's got an image of the skull that he sent me where you could see the outline of that Broadhead through the bear skull has crazy kill the bear and didn't even fuck up the air on my closet crazy until a lot of it like you see people doing these incredible feets like hammering through nails and shit like that with their knives and like what the fuck you think that most people are used to our chef's knife and they think they did that with their shift so I moved it up and where hundred percent it pretty much would but with the right thickness coming up to The Cutting Edge as well as the actual lead cutting edge geometry like the actual angle that is sharp in that you do that shit all day long now when you sharpen a blade do you use something to hold it next

<timemark seconds="4569" />

to the stone so that it reaches the perfect angle or do you do it by I Do by the guide so that would inform me as to the angle so when the edge of my finger would touch the top of the stone that told me that was about the right angle and then when I flipped it over to do the other side I do the same thing with my phone and essentially needs to know from experience I just know from experience they do make a sharpening guys that you can clip onto the back of the lives as well as little ramps those are all great especially for starting the hardest part about all of this is the muscle memory portion it's figuring out how to lock in and maintain that angle without wavering and it's it's like riding a bike or any other anything you've ever had to learn a life with practice and repetition you get better what do you think about that move those machines as like a little

<timemark seconds="4629" />

a little

<timemark seconds="4630" />

grinding really bad I have to destroy turn around and reinvest the most people aren't usually sold for very much money that are being used with those things and when they're not selling them for me very much you're relying on volume and what better way does the job for a little bit but ultimately destroys it and you have to reinvest what about you stick it in the slot a little slower process but you'll notice the problem with those the real problem with those is that you can't sharpen the whole she usually start Hill or just a little bit of the major work

<timemark seconds="4688" />

and so the problem is because you're not getting the full length you'll continue to Dish this material out just in front of heel and then when you go to cut it there's it's just a little bit of work especially when you're relying on that cutting board when the Night comes down to The Cutting Board to do some work it's not happening I cut my lunch with that today nice cut the excess out Axis deer and Elk, God that was killing me last Friday but you know what I learned how to cook I mean I feel like there's some real art to that as well from my friend Chad Ward Whiskey Bent BBQ on Instagram he's like a Pitmaster like a legit during World Champion BBQ master and he's the one who taught me how to cook slowly at low temperatures and then sear it after you're done I was taught

<timemark seconds="4748" />

Costa just put it on high heat cook shit out of it and eat it you know too but you know when you're dealing with what I really had to learn especially in particular cooking with some wild game is very unforgiving yeah it's got none it's so you're basically eating a sprinter

<timemark seconds="4773" />

seriously so that's the end of reverse sear it in a pan with grass-fed but here that pain beautiful listen to that sound that's the last my back strap I got to I got to get some more meat I eat to fight so much mean it's crazy super super healthy though bitch what you heard it looks like it works now it's something really magical about wild game and I don't know what the fuck it is I really don't think anybody does cuz I don't think there's enough people out there that are eating it but it has it has a different effect on your body it feels different when I eat beef grass-fed beef total pasture-raised the difference butcher box companies the shit don't they'll send it to your house

<timemark seconds="4833" />

Lowe's in grass-fed pasture raised like in the pasture finished and it's pretty cheap too it's a good deal if you want to sponsor this podcast and I use them all the time I think it's amazing it's a few times and it's actually really good beef happy beef well I'm actually in some place in my god when you take a bite like the even just that first by it's just like it's a whole different flavors everything I have my friend my friend Mike Hawk Ridge he lives up in British Columbia like the real book British Columbia Look Away the fuck up there and he's a hunting guide and got him some tickets for the fights in Vegas and his wife came down and then afterwards we went out to eat and they were eating steak we ate at a restaurant and they're laughing looks like they're used to eating moose you know they're like

<timemark seconds="4893" />

this deed is like it's like the poor little sick animal and I think it's all Moshi if you eat a piece of wild moose meat it's like well you eat you like holy shit it's like filled with flavor and it's just it feels like like it gives you energy is crazy I don't know what is that people are trying to like in Jackie Young

<timemark seconds="4920" />

people's blood into the body and mind trying to make themselves feel younger like eating well Source I don't know if it's the same but I mean there's got to be something to consuming and Incredibly healthy vibrant animal versus something that's like raising a cake right just just make sense but I don't think this is something that you can I mean they have absolutely measured protein content in the protein contents off the charts of the difference in the protein content of chicken or regular beef versus moose or elk it's much higher much denser in protein like I think something like 6 oz of axis deer is 48 grams of protein which is incredible you know

<timemark seconds="4980" />

to get that same amount of protein like you don't have to go or giant you just you just eat that little bit. You really need less than 6 ounces you like 3 oz food is just to me as especially as I've gotten older you start doing a lot more cookies and it becomes a different thing I'm I'm I'm hungry any stuff my face like the preparing of food much like we were talking about with craftsmanship like there's an art Jamaican food and I mean I'm by no means a chef but I can cook a few things really good you know and I take great satisfaction that I thought I'd love it you know I'll take the Heat this but we we get home and more like more hungry going to make some food 2 hours later she saw a lot of people

<timemark seconds="5040" />

my brother's the same way like I'm fucking hungry now I need to eat now I have your fucking head off a set up some cheese and some like salami or something like that I just relax like I could be starving I get done with the long ass day I'll go home and I want to I'd like I have this thing locked in my mind that I want to eat I'll take two hours to make the bucket thing even though I'm starving to death in the afternoon at 9 at night do you find that as a person who is a Craftsman an artisan that you try to have that approach with like other things in your life to like what your dark just talking about like making food and yeah sure I mean I feel like I don't really think too much about the fact that I'm doing it this way it's just kind of way I do things and I'm a little bit more methodical and I guess not necessarily more thoughtful than anybody else just like when I'm go to app when I approach these challenges

<timemark seconds="5100" />

are these things I got to do I take my time to do them right and try to do them right the first time I used to actually when I was working for Bob we would have to mock up stuff for a build machines or or or pictures or some shit like that and you know he was a very his might that was quick and dirty we get this done as quick as possible and it doesn't work the first time will make some modifications and we'll try the second time still didn't work sick time so and so forth so on so forth until we got it right where I would just think it through a little bit more

<timemark seconds="5136" />

first time was all I needed but I heard there was a long time I used to do a lot of woodworking for you at the metal working and I was I always had to measure 5 times and that's why I'm so I started getting to the point where I really because it's just to me it felt like a huge waste of time and energy and materials really to go through all that process and then

<timemark seconds="5164" />

how to be a long journey curb the right to like really learn how to specially I would imagine the forging aspect of it probably incredibly difficult and when I was working for Bob did was 14th of Damascus to make the patterns and then we would like cut blades out and go from there I learned forging about 5 years ago essentially working with a gentleman named David Lish who's also he's a master bladesmith he used to work at Seattle he's downtown Olympia area now but he you know what he did he's a blacksmith by trade that got in tonight making and he's fucking skilled he super-talent especially when it comes to Bowie knives at Hunter's like he doesn't really great work and especially is Damascus patterns a really great but to watch somebody

<timemark seconds="5213" />

move and manipulate material and like I said before like stock removal is a very valid way of doing it cuz the cost of the actual materials is very small compared to stop so early I was talking about taking a bath and then cutting out the blade removal from the start menu parent material would you take what's left in melted down you could melt it down you could turn it in Forge it into other stuff it's it's a really interesting practice it's actually it is kind of like mean on people who refer to go guys practicing never going to be perfect like there's never going to be Perfection blade forging but there's always an opportunity to learn something and the practice it and so when you see it and like you have a decent little chunky know you start smashing on that thing and see what you can get out of it to economize that material and again like I said you don't really need to do that because of how inexpensive

<timemark seconds="5273" />

if you think back like a hundred years like this high quality material is fucking expensive you had to get the most out of it as you possibly could and so that's why forging was such a big deal and then as that price went down people change the way they manufactured just because then the time was the thing that cost the most not the material and so they turn around and easier to manufacture then give a shit about the ways how did you learn handle geometry like the handle on this hunting knife and perfectly fits in your hand out and that's cool I'm not shaking your hand back it fits so well feels like you're holding for people are just listening to visit initial smoothness in the front and then there's like this little bump and then

<timemark seconds="5333" />

Autumn and it just locks in your hand band just feels personal I was inspired to do that by and make her name Claude Bush on he's a Belgian maker I first met him so hard he is he the first time I met him was at blade show which is a huge knife Exposition is the biggest one in the world that happens down in Atlanta every year the first weekend of June he was my table neighbor and I've never told him the story but the first time I saw his knives was like the blades and everything looked great and looks fucking weird shit this and oh yeah very similar to that handle instead of how that one's kind of at a clip or angle and so

<timemark seconds="5386" />

finally a like on the third day of the show this really great make sure that I look up to you came over and he was just like doting over clouds work and I was like right there must be something I feel like I didn't even touch the stuff I was just looking at it and judging and I picked it up I was like it was a it was a totally like what the fuck does that same feeling that you have when you're holding it feels perfect as like it's a totally shifted my entire mindset and Paradigm around what I thought handle shapes should look and feel like and that is definitely Inspire continued especially for like hard use knives like especially like for a bigger blade like a bush knife that you trying to chop do stuff with a handle like that is going to benefit you immensely cuz it just it feels like a natural extension of your hand and is this your your logo into the bottom

<timemark seconds="5446" />

Ron around each other and it looks kind of like a flame dude I'm such a dork for this shit I love it so interesting man

<timemark seconds="5454" />

and that the handle to the something about that the handle being made out of antler like the antler the feel that it has your hand to the organic materials antler and Bone they have this kind of like I don't know if you've experienced it with these especially cutting up the like the greasy meat but it from from right to it stays grippy why has it become super slippery the handle on my bow is actually made out of antler I had it custom-made my friend John Dudley had these ones made from a bull that he killed on September 11th 2001 like the 911 bowl and he had these handles made out of the antlers of this and it does the way it sits in your hand it's like it's got an even if you're sweaty or you know that there's something you know it's raining out I just has an extra grip to it especially something like that like

<timemark seconds="5510" />

if your skinny break it's important but it's not going to look like it's not like one of those moments where you relying on that group for your life for your life like you're trying to do is argue like you're digging in the ground your phone down the hillside new trying to get out of it and get ahold like that's going to be really important but obviously that's a very rare yeah when that would happen it's just something cool about it to you know I just like the team to let you know it's just again it goes back to the user experience and what does it feel like how is it different I am makes it really does make a difference the one of the cool things to me also about antlers is that they shed them know that they lose these things every year and that every year they grow a new one to know that it's the fastest growing organic material on Earth

<timemark seconds="5564" />

no I didn't know that that shit right there on the giant elk antler that grows in a couple months

<timemark seconds="5572" />

I didn't know that yeah falls off right they lose it after they're done running so after they're done letting they grow the whole thing back in a couple months it's radical see if you find a video that shows elk antler growth time lapse cuz it's crazy how fast it grows and it's all just for war and that's all that is it's to show off for the ladies hair and it's also for war that rack just so he could fuc people up or fuck new people but also elk you know and definitely people you get close to them fuck me up but look at the following photos were taken about a week apart over a period of you that's April 1st I'll check this out watch just just have it play out there it says over four months they show the incredible Grosso April 1st watch this is like a farm

<timemark seconds="5632" />

that looks like it is looks like it's an elk Farm

<timemark seconds="5636" />

just let it play out April 8th phone so 7 Days Later look at that April 15th bang big that shit is Boom April 29th that's nuts May 6th May 13th May 20th May 25th

<timemark seconds="5664" />

June 4th get ready to go to war June 10th look at that comes near me June 24th look at that and then July 1st that is crazy it's it's crazy done July 8th July 15th now he's basically still in velvet and then July 22nd that looks hard horn to me that looks like he shed his velvet and then July 29th is that nuts bizarre so by the time August rolls around there like right now the beginning of September there in hard horned and they'll go to war and they'll keep that shit for you know till the end of the

<timemark seconds="5710" />

maybe January and then Hilda lose it so is the fastest growing organic material yes by all those things because it was so fast it's so heavy I mean that's like 40 pounds just of antlers and a grows over a couple months it's fucking nuts man organic material but I think it's true looking it says the first fun fact I found it they can grow 10 lb of velvet per year

<timemark seconds="5743" />

that's just the Veil Just The Velvet yet

<timemark seconds="5746" />

yeah but that's probably cuz though it's a velvet Farm you know they use that stuff for human growth hormone like a lot of baseball players were taken with a friend of mine my friend John rivet shut up John rivet he lives in Alberta and his one of his friends had an elk Farm up there in Alberta and he grew out not for the meat but for the for the Velvet because that stuff that grows grows so fast in a so so ridiculously potent that they would take antler velvet and they were turn into a spray that would equal the effects of human growth hormone

<timemark seconds="5787" />

how did you do that crap to me it's like I don't know but athletes were taking it athletes were taking this stuff and it was having this for like growth hormone reaction in their body aches and Jackson but there's something about deer velvet that was for quite him you know I don't even know if it worked but it was it a big thing in the the supplement and fitness industry that people getting deer velvet the new Vibe and supposed to give you a growth hormone

<timemark seconds="5827" />

I do think of that will appear did you have you had only Olympia Olympia Washington what the fuck everything is being sore silver seat I mean what you're from the Pacific Northwest but now you live in Connecticut the state of shit on the most this whole video of me shooting in Connecticut like people of made a compilation of me should I can ask her I'm sure plenty of shout out to my good friend. I finally found it so I think it's just antlers in general are the fastest-growing tissue and in any memo and then elk antler is the fastest growing out of all of them because it's the largest so grows in the same amount of time that a deer would grow its antlers but it's far larger

<timemark seconds="5881" />

you know what are some of the deer species like by far you know I think I got a full grown Yukon moose could be as much as 2000 pounds a really big Rocky Mountain elk under normal circumstances is like a fucking giant one is pushing a thousand fits a giant 400 inch bull like that one that's out crunch the inches the measurement of the size of the inches of the antler that's considerably bigger than 382 in outside giant Bowl

<timemark seconds="5937" />

huge moose appear twice as Big Moose would see that thing go shut the fuck up bitch there the weird thing about a moose as their antlers like a door or you know it's basically like they're so fat that it's not like poke mean they're basically like they're hitting each other in the head with doors but you see how do you say I seen a few pictures where the special and they're fucking stuck more deer than the design of a Moose's antlers is like it's not as intertwine but it would tear it happens all the time because there's a little bit of flex to the Bone and so the clash and in the force of the two of them Slam in each other they get stuck will they drown they fought like that and then you know wrestled and wound up in the water and one of drowning

<timemark seconds="5994" />

is a horrible video I saw of two deer that got stuck in one of them got killed by a coyote not just on your whole pack of them torn to shreds it to him in the eat them asshole first as I've documented many times in this podcast but the one deer was still attached to his dead friend and these Hunters had to help it get released new sod one of the antlers off the other deer is dead deer and freed it and then this other one ran off like what a nightmare that guy's live through right now his buddy it's his asshole torn apart they literally eating them alive while he's stuck to the guy, yeah, I could have easily been you I mean literally could have easily been you know there's two deer one of them

<timemark seconds="6054" />

sitting there like living with the horror of his these people come over and he can't get away from the fucking people and let these people going to eat me and they don't even eat them they let him go and their Hunters they Freedom up and let him lose crazy yeah you got that are there is one that elk got stuck at the gym with a dead elk that's a dead elk and Elk Head it's stuck on the other Elks but see I don't know what that was that to me makes me think that that could have very easily been like an elk found a dead elk I just started head-butting and ripped his head off and got stuck with him they kill each other all the time right now I mean all the time but geez look at those racks when you hear them fighting like one of the first times ever won elk hunting we were coming over this hill and it sounded like two dudes slam and baseball bats together just

<timemark seconds="6114" />

and when we came over the top of the hill these two giant elk we're just running at each other and smashing each other it was a magical day was like one of the first times I ever elk hunted in there's a thing that happens when you hit a peak rut and when the peak rut happens they just go crazy all around you they're all screaming and it might only happen once in a season and you just if you might be there for that couple hours when it all goes down what's Insanity Insanity there's all around screaming and head-butting each other so vulnerable

<timemark seconds="6158" />

and they're so big man this it's a screw that there's there's two going at it right there and hear him

<timemark seconds="6166" />

it is class and slamming each other oh yeah they kill each other all the time. And then the hormones they got going on like yeah my friend came across one last year and he crept up on it he thought it was bedded and he shot it with an arrow and didn't move is like what the fuck and he got over to it is already dead and another alcat stabbed it if they stab it through the heart and lay down and died right happens all the time but they're always finding him that other other Alcove murdered they don't realize how much is a month to month month maybe a little bit longer there's a second rut sometimes in October when another female going to ask Chris and then they'll resume the right

<timemark seconds="6226" />

magical times it's pretty cool man it's pretty cool you know the real wild the actual real wild will you are in Connecticut man you going to worry about two things hit a deer with your car and Lyme disease the line is okay so that's something that we didn't realize we were moving into an hour going back and forth when you were about to move right yeah that was definitely one of the things that we like ticks in if you're listening this anyone East Coast especially the New York is got it really bad medicinal Lyme disease map and you see like the instances of Lyme disease in the east coast it's horrific man now and I know at least a dozen people that have it and it stays with you for life and my friend Jim Miller he's got two fights in the UFC he's going to take a giant fist full of pills everyday I mean he's got a real bad

<timemark seconds="6286" />

real bad and he still fighting still fighting in the UFC we drove cross-country at Sunset and drove from there all the way to Connecticut dark and all I could think of is like I'm a fucking hit a deer you see so many of them right you see so many dead ones on the side of blows my mind but the biggest issue has been actually other Connecticut driver's is that the biggest concern my wife and I both been T-boned in the last 8 months people in Connecticut just they're just giving up man this is hitting the gas and closing her eyes what's crazy is like a villain in fucking Oregon Seattle all kinds of crazy places but they all have like a culture about how they work and I could not figure out and a friend

<timemark seconds="6346" />

explain it to me he said they're driving as if nobody else is on the road I was like holy shit that makes perfect sense the choices they make nobody else is there I'll be coming up and it in the passing Lane some reason tonight to the right of me there's no exits coming up there's no other cars for like half a mile I'm cruising probably like 5 10 miles faster than them they change lanes right for me

<timemark seconds="6372" />

you know why because like say if you your lips would say there's a thing that you're making like an epoxy right when you make an epoxy to several ingredients they have to add to it or maybe that's not the best example like say maybe there is a Electronics just whatever it is that you're you're making so you so if you're making a thing and it requires 10 different ingredients

<timemark seconds="6402" />

if you are a person in Connecticut you have Aid ingredients you don't have those other two and you just do with it without you just deal with it you just missing two things you just hit the gas and just drive places to go and no one knows what they're doing and that this is not a real estate just not with also Bonkers that we weren't expecting is that unless you're driving like a stop light and stop signs are suggestion people used right I don't even know why I don't know where they're going they don't understand missing all sorts of stuff they just did is so confused too late

<timemark seconds="6449" />

it's just those things that have been a serious culture shock for us especially the summer man here fighting thousand ticks and you fucking can't walk anymore ball sweat sweat more than what the hell yeah well you're used to you know that Pacific Northwest is really get that hot and the summers are glorious like Seattle and Oregon summer of God the glory everything is fucking neon green and the Sun comes out it's amazing it's almost almost makes up for the winter

<timemark seconds="6507" />

I'm not quite the lack of winter rain just the rain stop raining there is a winter it's just it's not it's not frozen is tempered but it's just me and do you like I could do this I can hang in there waiting for your husband to come home he's not home now I got a great house he's coming home coming home to give me home for 8 months and just going to piss on your hair for 8 months to 8 months of clouds and fucking craft beers and just everybody shoot themselves it's dark up there man I don't think people are meant to live like that I mean I think it's gorgeous and its benefits to it for sure but I had a buddy of mine he tried to convince me to live out there till Arius my friend salami he moved to Portland that's named try to move to Portland he did move to Portland

<timemark seconds="6567" />

Jiu-Jitsu up there it's like to Dilaudid fucking great up here fucking amazing I know you don't mind about the winner your mind about the rainbows now he goes to the people are so fucking cool to restaurants are amazing and the summers are so good three years later he's back in La couldn't do it man I see the thing you hang in there for as long as you can but you can't hang in there forever that what it is but some people can I can I don't think so cuz my sister and my mom both grew up there to my wife even can't handle it I hate it it just rained just gets dark I guess I think part of my issues like I said I always work in restaurants or in fucking ever in the shop so it's like I'm in a virtual cave all the

<timemark seconds="6627" />

and I'm not experiencing that except for the drive home or to work what's up Jamie that's what it is bro I mean they probably called it that on purpose I mean I don't think they needed to call it seasonal affective disorder that's not the best feel like shit because of the rain disease. Isn't it something about like the lack of vitamin tell you what though all day I'll take Seattle over Connecticut all day a few months

<timemark seconds="6677" />

people that live in Connecticut right now go what the fuck dude running gag folks I don't really care I love it love it when I first moved there I thought I was in Washington right at the base of Puget Sound water around actually used to like sale on a racing team and stuff like that wow I'm going to miss the water so much and it's so green to I got there and I was like I don't care about the green but the second the spring rains hit all the trees start to Blossom holy shit and it was a beautiful beautiful that was everywhere these bitches understand. It's everywhere but you know what what

<timemark seconds="6737" />

as that's amazing man is the view of the mountains there's something about being that just like humbles you puts it in perspective yeah you right it's crazy the cities were engineers coming up and down Hills and like a monster. It's amazing that we went I'm looking for bigfoot up there wants me and Duncan yeah yeah we found it won't tell anybody that area too is so densely wooded it's really incredible when you go walking through the woods like there's you don't make any sound when you walk you don't leave any Footprints because it's just like feet thick of pine needles and the model is so soft and it's interesting and then filled with Elfman is Elk everywhere up there like you can't see him anymore cuz there's like so many trees

<timemark seconds="6797" />

my in-laws they live south of Olympia and they have 60 Acres out there like that are like in a barn in the house and stuff rest of its all wooded they got black bears large cat I like Bobcats for sure they have their standing on the highlight it up there beautiful akula watch to a lush tropical rainforest up there it's so wild it's it's it's so interesting to when you when you're up there you you realize like how diverse it is with life when you walking around in it and you see just elk shit everywhere you go walk into the woods that there is just a test with the pals all the little marvels

<timemark seconds="6857" />

Herman's she's gorgeous man yet here you are getting out in the woods and just walking around it's it's actually been really cool take it especially when you go back in the summer time and especially in the summer time to go visit family take my little dude my son is 2 years old he just turn to insult walking with him and he just fucking loves it walking to the and you don't have to worry about the fucking kicks going up the app of my soul like quarter mile trail goes up to the woods we just walk through that thing he just marches along whole fucking way and just that experience of stop listening you can hear the red tail hawk crying over the top of everything else and then you have great horned owls from time to time that cook crus the was there you can hear their little chipmunks in this world

<timemark seconds="6917" />

crows and everything and stopping and telling him how to see a little kid whose so fucking rambunctious made in the house but you get a mountain in the woods yeah isn't amazing to looking at you the eyes of your child and just watching them experience and always think it's it's like you can almost see like the little yeah I know it's amazing that's one thing that I didn't anticipate before I had children like watching them learn like oh wow like there's a crazy trip you get out of watching kids learn you know this is something about like you learn watching them learn and it really sort of reinforces it's idea that every human being is essential

<timemark seconds="6977" />

I'm going on a blank slate but they are most certainly subject to the influences of their environment with experience and actually I take that data in ya is crazy like we have he loves maps maps maps like the globe and none of those countries are marked out all night or anything but we knew some of the spots and so we started teaching but he knows we're like over a hundred different countries are like he knows where they're at he can point out the difference between Cambodia Vietnam he likes hungry turkey he liked it he knows that he knows what Portugal is he can show you this

<timemark seconds="7037" />

cuz I'm playing the game with your mouth have like the world again but everything's all the different flags he so open you know children mean they learn language so quick and so open me think about kids learn language by the time they go to school there you know how to talk but learn how to talk for teaching English as a second language so she's with him all day long and Emily of teachers her parents both of her parents her sister her great-grandmother or start her grandmother all Educators eat your own shoes with a dude

<timemark seconds="7097" />

how to interact with the world yeah but it's so cool and and with that background understanding how to interpret what's going on in his brain a little bit so it's help nourish it essentially to help like just make things that much more solid likes fucking crazy find Auction you have a bunch of the auction but he's he's got these fucking killer knives that I he's made these Chef's knives one that's going up I think so I look how beautiful that as we're looking at his amausi fire Arts Instagram page and the design the pattern on this chef's knife it doesn't even look real folks I mean it looks like someone's
