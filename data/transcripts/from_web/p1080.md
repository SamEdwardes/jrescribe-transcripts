<timemark seconds="535" />

The Joe Rogan Experience

<timemark seconds="542" />

thanks man appreciate it thank you for having me appreciate that I showed up you were working out that's my life that's pretty crazy though I mean how much time did you have when you got here I got here about an hour early so I got here at shirt off doing chin-ups who's the movie next next time I'll catch you after the show you are a guy that for a lot of people you sort of embody the idea of hardening your mind and figuring out a way to do things that most people think are impossible that's you sort of become that guy over your life and you become that guy for a lot of people including me online we talked about you on the podcast a ton of times so having you in here is been very excited to me I appreciate that thank you

<timemark seconds="601" />

you know what I grew up not that guy so a lot of people put a title on me they want to They See Me Now They See Me Now is a guy with his shirt off we can do 4030 pull-ups and 17 hours to go run 205 miles and 39 hours who do I was crazy shit but where they don't understand if they don't understand the journey took me to get to this point and what got me to this point was I was just the opposite of rain today I was that guy who ran away from absolutely everything that got in front of me not many people do that to people like the real me was like this very scared insecure stuttering got beat up by his dad I was kind of stuff I bought this fake person that walked around like my shit in the stink you know you know it

<timemark seconds="661" />

I was lying to myself a lot of people but it's a fascinating Journey though because you are that guy now you genuinely are legit badass at one point time you were legit terrified person is so what was the process like how did how did you step four

<timemark seconds="680" />

well it's it's it's a long process right my dad beat the shit out he was growing up I was the first black baby born in this hospital called Miller Fillmore in Buffalo New York my dad on skating rink see on bars here and prostitutes from Canada to Buffalo New York my dad was a big-time pimp a Time anything bad about a person Big Time Hustler he was American movie time Denzel Washington he was at but not that bad he wasn't that big but that's what reminds me of he was that kind of guy and beat the shit out of me did she help you out of my mom there was an incident more time in the mall got knocked out top of the stairs and trucks sold

<timemark seconds="727" />

in my mind I was always afraid my whole life I was your voice this this conscience that would always be battling me so hey you got to get up and do something I didn't want to do shit. I was just afraid but I would that that voice would force me to get up in my dad and I try to beat him up whatever at 6 and I get my ass kicked so it's been on for several years and have a big time learning disabilities can my dad is going to school so my dad is about to business the skating rink in the bar so just give me a call about 7 at night and this is Tom I was able to walk so about final four five six years old 8 9 and I'll go to sling a skating rink 7 at night and I work the skating rink until 10 at night and then we will scrape the gum off the floors and clean the whole skating rink up and then my dad is office in my brother and myself asleep in the office my mama go upstairs and work the bar until 3 in the morning and then they clean the bar up so

<timemark seconds="787" />

after all that she was done with going to school really happened so when I went to school I was all kind of my disability I had social anxiety I was just a jacked up kid from living in this tortured home from the outside looking in was it an all-white neighborhood and then we would travel to the Ghetto of Buffalo New York with the skating rink was that so you know we worked around mostly blacks and whites but no one knew what was going on that house at on 201 Paradise Road is crazy but my mom got courage to finally leave him for 8 years old we move to a small town in Brazil Indiana and that's when the real war started for me and he has a small town great people a lot of great people and I say that because I don't get offended and I'm going to get the point where to get offended it was about maybe 10 black families at about 10,000 people in town

<timemark seconds="843" />

in 1995 the KKK March 4th of July parade so this was a lot of races in there so me being one of the few black kids napping on the area you know it kind of hurt you I had stuff on my notebook neoniger going to kill you I'm going to Spanish notebook they have it on my card later when I can this is really nice and I just so you know I showed it didn't hurt me it was jacking me up so all the insecurities I have him as a kid with my father I'm moving to this area here and it just got worse and worse and worse and It's haunting me and that voice. Talked about it kept talking louder and louder and louder don't do nothing about it and I just have to make moves and I cheated all through school and it's it's kind of hungry to talk on my story sometimes and it's it's also embarrassing but it's real it's who the fuck I am

<timemark seconds="903" />

created me and Poppy from the fourth grade to the two to my junior year in high school on every assignment and I want to get the military to join the Airforce the guy gave me an ASVAB test is like a watered-down SAT and I couldn't copy on it because it got to be something had to test ATI test be together my ride had Tennessee so I look the copy on this test I can a copy on it I got 20 and I want to be a Air Force pararescuemen it's got to jump out of airplanes and Savion Pilots it's a it's a special operator in the Air Force and my score was so horribly low that is retake it again and he said hey I got the 18 the second time even worse I need to get a 50 out of a 99 and so my mom and I for a while we live in the government subsidized apartments $7 a month and also food stamps and we slowly moved up to him $230 a month place that the time y'all are pretty for butt

<timemark seconds="961" />

the mom afford enough money for me to go to see a tutor one one hour a week so for 4 hours a month and have 6 months to study for my last test I want to take the address to know the answer test 3 times and I

<timemark seconds="974" />

study my ass off of past it I got in the Air Force realize there's more things in front of me I was afraid of water purify the water and I don't know how to swim but we get everybody in this training and all special ops training is water confidence so they try to be much drowned your ass you know all of her lies we've been breathing and they take that from you if you want to see how comfortable you are on the water is like 1% African Americans in Special Operations and I didn't know anything about African that we like a lot of my next appointment which I am because the bone density I struggled but I'm 6 weeks in the program for about 25 guys left of about 150 I was there and I was asleep for 6 weeks the program and I want to quit so badly but I quit everything in my life I copy to school I want to prove people wrong and so here I am in this Air Force program start to get a little more confidence but this water was kicking my ass and 6 weeks in the program

<timemark seconds="1034" />

gave me a blood test it was at sickle-cell sickle-cell trait not the anemia but I still kill people but so he pulled me out training for a week and when you go from being very uncomfortable in that water situation and then now you're comfortable and I'm sitting back watching the guys drowned I'm not I'm not party activities anymore for this week I want to get back in that damn water again so the fear overcame in all my insecurities from my dad from this small town from everything so I coming back and even though no one knew how fucked up I was Skype created other person was tough I live with this should all time so me not want to go back to that water the doctor call me back up I thought to get like a like a medical kicked out of military so no quitting for me or kick me out so I can have some pride the doctor said no they will be able to put you back in the training

<timemark seconds="1083" />

and I was like fuck but that's your week and let you know what I missed one week There's Only 3 weeks left is a good chance you know I could check this shit out and go on my way back to the CEO and the commanding officer of the program and a sergeant from day one because you missed you know that that we could train you and I broke I broke I couldn't imagine going back to that again so I made up a lie and I said man is sickle-cell things really scare me it was a fucking water wouldn't sickle-cell then I pretty much quit even though they gave me a medical equipment so well

<timemark seconds="1123" />

age of 19 age of 22 I went to the job called tacp where you control fast movers Behind Enemy Lines cool job but there's no water I was afraid of water so I avoided it and I gained 225 lb in that time frame I went from 175 to almost 300 to 297 with my heaviest that's not a funny things that was comfortable in the more things I found comfortable the more uncomfortable my mind was cuz that voice I'll tell you about it he always was there I wasn't trying to avoid that conscience I want to be left alone from that conscious and it wouldn't leave me alone so I got out the Air Force and I start working for a job for Ecolab free spray for cockroaches at 24 and spraying at different Steak and Shakes Red Lobster at 7 in the morning and what changed I came home and watch the Discovery Channel show clap 224 I came home from Steak and Shake and spray it down last get a big old large 40

<timemark seconds="1183" />

wild shake walk across the street and get a box of mini Donuts from 7-Eleven drive home for 45 minutes this big old fat guy who yeah I worked out but I was fat I didn't run it at PTI City gym so while I'm driving home to my TV on and what comes on Discovery Channel show in that's where everything change for me I was taking a shower I walked out who these guys and I watch the show and it made me reflect big time on the piece of shit that I am and I'm exactly what people said I was going to be so what was on the show The really struck home I saw these guys going in the water so I was terrified of it and I can't even express have you had a big fear a lot of Fighters have fears and stuff like that but they get over these fears that you just don't want to fucking face

<timemark seconds="1236" />

I have a lot of them had a lot of them and that's what created the person in front of you today and it will get into that

<timemark seconds="1244" />

but I'm just too scared bitch is that I was and I've watched this guy's going through hell week class 224 and you guys are ringing the bell quitting dropping their helmet down rolling out a lot of guys just leaving and it made me reflect on my fears my insecurities and I saw a real men I thought were real man who were staying for overcoming adversity who are overcoming all these different things that I had to blame so many fucking people in my life for my dad my mom for not being there when I was 14 years old my mama to get remarried to the straight guy who got murdered and then I move back to a small town in Brazil and everybody was applying for disability my skin color everything and so am I sat there for a while and I was like man I got a fucking I've got it no one's going to fucking come to help me

<timemark seconds="1298" />

no one's going to fucking come help me he's just fucking me against me. Then I'm so I had to man up and I said of course the guy start doing his face and every fucking fear I have that what the fuck it is man and these things will keep me up at night no one people who were hearing this shit that they will never really understand a grass when You Face these things are so many things how they keep you up and haunt you at night a lot of people out there that know what you're talking about I mean

<timemark seconds="1331" />

be that 300-pound guy who spray for cockroaches and made $1,000 a month and that 24 years old knowing when I'm 50 fucking years old I can reflect on this and think about what guy never became or I can totally just pack it up and fail and fail and fail and tie succeed so I started call recruiters up my sound go be a fucking Navy SEAL and every crew so there's a weight and height this is so the weight and height limit to get in the military and I was six foot one and 297 and I have prior service which was a big deal so I called all these recruiters up and said hey how tall are you available to get into conversation see if he's even qualified and by time I got to my phone were hanging out pretty much like I call somebody else and I'll try to get in the reserves so I try to get the Reserves at College got in Stevenson Al Jarreau recruiter out they said they come on in

<timemark seconds="1384" />

you saw me coming to the weight standard all this other stuff and to get into the class I had to get into how to lose a hundred 6 pounds in less than 3 months

<timemark seconds="1392" />

so I was like fuck that I can't do that Grandma chocolate milkshake and went back to Ecolab I'm going back to work man this is my life so in this job you look I'm looking for cockroaches looking for rotors and stuff like that and this next morning or this next night I went to work and I hit the ball like cockroaches too much I hit the motherload of cockroaches and this restaurant got full of cock roaches and rodents and everything else and I sat there and said this is my life I see this is exactly who the fuck is it going to be it for me so in that restaurant I quit my job left my canister that restaurant my my spray canister got back in my truck and I went home and I started working out like somebody became the most obsessed person on the planet Earth

<timemark seconds="1449" />

I had to invent a guy that didn't exist I didn't been a guy that can take any panties suffer any kind of judgment be called Niger be called whatever the fuck in the world and be honest and say go fuck yourself how to build the out of build iskalis mine and I built it through suffering I built it to down right fucking just crushing myself if it was raining outside to know what it's worth anything cuz don't go out there and do shit my mistake was we got a fucking go out there anything that was fucking horrible in my life that I would normally say no that was inhumane the most people I had to go do it and I started Palace in my mind at this point in my life and I lost the weight I lost the weight and I went back to recruit I got into that class and I went through three day be so helping someone year

<timemark seconds="1503" />

play God ever be in three whole weeks in one year if to my knowledge the first I didn't make it through the next two I did and that I just didn't stop any more from there and I started realizing to this through this process

<timemark seconds="1519" />

that the fucking mine is what you created and I start to open a different doors I didn't think we're even there didn't think even existed in the more doors open up the more I start realizing that my potential is damn near endless it changed my whole mind-set from David Goggins that created Goggins

<timemark seconds="1540" />

and that journey is a Priceless Journey that is hard meeting explain to people cuz it sounds so quick and easy like I just bought this way and I went through three hoagie sandwich Ranger school with the Delta Force selection for whatever it was brutal it's a brutal Journey every fucking day ever list are you happy

<timemark seconds="1558" />

if anybody knows my life story I'll try to give you a hug just a snippet of it where I'm at the Days Inn front of Joe Rogan telling you my life to get through what I became to get through where I'm at now is nothing but Pride a half of myself that I can't really I can't believe so people can I have the space under space that they see that are you happy what's wrong with you I'm driven I'm obsessed and did you see people need to hear the story this is a this is an exciting story for people because there's a lot of people out there that feel trapped and they feel stuck and they feel like they can't do anything this is who they are your God who felt that exact same way but figured out how to not be that person and be a person you would admire how did you go to the first steps like you had some slips before right cuz you you quit because of the water thing right but then when you went back the second time you decide you're going to lose all that weight you quit that job did digit was it just straight forward from there or where there's some days

<timemark seconds="1618" />

so you just failed and then you picked it back up again so my first run that I decide to lose the weight I was like I said 297 about 32% body fat and my idea was to run 4 miles from my first run I didn't know how bad it's going to fucking hurt me I used to run before I was fat and I ran 1/4 Mile walked on my couch and cry with your mom's house she was about 40 about maybe 20 minutes down the road and try to get her calcium I can't fucking do this shot I don't know when with you just got somebody pregnant my life was as fuck I make $1,000 a month my rent was 8:10 a month and my mom just kept fucking with me and care for me not good enough man this isn't for you and these guys a bass my first you not that

<timemark seconds="1670" />

what it was and it's kind of funny I was obsessed with Rocky

<timemark seconds="1675" />

Rocky one in particular and when I was a kid I come home everyday now watch this fucking show Rocky and I would fast forward with the little VHS tapes to 1414 fuck me up like nobody's business why the song came on my truck listen to the song for 17 hours at 2 minutes and 13 seconds

<timemark seconds="1699" />

and I'm able to visualize and dream

<timemark seconds="1704" />

nobody's business and I know that many people can't I work for it so the Bears and I had was Apollo Creed beat the fucking shit out of Rocky beat the shit out of his kept fighting he was a dumb fighter couldn't read couldn't fuck tells me you couldn't write just Punchy everything about him and Rocky hobby shop in East Neck or nearby was saying stay the fuck down and him getting up and getting up Apollo Creed races are there in the fucking your turn around 5 when the fight he turns around and sees this guy getting up and it was the face of Apollo Creed that changed my life

<timemark seconds="1745" />

the face of Apollo Creed it was like just buy that motherfucker getting up not winning just I am getting the fuck up about the best Rocky you taking his soul literally taking his so his head goes down he looks like what the fuck are you

<timemark seconds="1765" />

I wanted to be that got rocky I want to be the guy that people looked at I'll give you like me or didn't like I don't care but it said this motherfukers going to keep coming after whatever the fuck is I wanted that I wanted that I wanted that more than anything in the world so that is I kept picturing me falling down and getting up every mother fucking to call me nigger I was even myself even myself I wanted to feel something besides defeat I wanted to this go to distance and not going to distance push me to a point of where now I go way past the distance so you go the first day you run a quarter-mile and you walk back home and you're upset how do you how do you move forward so basically I did when I came home

<timemark seconds="1818" />

chocolate milkshake I sat down I gave up I said single fucking happen

<timemark seconds="1830" />

I started being able to take negative shit and be happy and this whole I say what if a lot it sounds corny and it sounds weak but it's true

<timemark seconds="1842" />

what are the recruiters said there's not many black Navy Seals my back I was at 36 African American Steel in history is it over several years because the fucking water you know when people get mad at you just get over it so

<timemark seconds="1858" />

what story would it be if I fucking fat dumb

<timemark seconds="1864" />

lying to be friends with people insecure ass can overcome this shit and that what if mentality that that that that dreamer mentality just would always do with me if you shoot man what if I can be but if I can be a single man what would if I can go from there in the corner and fucking mom and 5 miles can go in and how would that feel if I'm graduating trying to get at the graduation thing I talked about 2:20 for the act like the video I sat down watch just ran off your stood up and he said to the graduation. You're graduating buds like 18 of them he said we live in a society where mediocrities often rewarded and you were going to say something about these men to test mediocrity

<timemark seconds="1910" />

I want to be a man that the test mediocrity trouble in the SEAL Teams and going forward because I just started looking down on people for not going hard fucking shit and I started to create different things but I swear different day but I just believe that if that is a problem that a lot of angry people who don't work hard to the point where you you know you want to insult them you want to you want to smack them and it's really cuz you're scared of seeing that yourself so I guess a lot of time off I would see people and if I was a direct reflection of who I was and I will get mad at Denver and Reflections probably just to get mad at myself for me a hundred percent when I when I see people that are half ass and things I get terrified of seeing that myself and I get mad at them and it's it's not a good way to handle it you know but it's it's natural cuz you

<timemark seconds="1970" />

terrified of seen that trait and it cost me so you come back you do the quarter mile you walk back home how do you regroup

<timemark seconds="1983" />

I got my milkshake paprocki I seen what I was big time in Rocky and fourtune why platoon I love to see people who were getting beat down and it's just the scenes received at this drove me in people of my hell leasing office in three of them they always hear me singing these songs the songs how many songs in torturous situation I would be somewhere gone somewhere fucking gone if summer fucking darkish it there's a scene at the tomb of Elias Ben Barnes shoots Elias and you know they think he lies to the chopper to take it off and Charlie Sheen's ask him you know Tom Berenger Elias

<timemark seconds="2030" />

do the woods the Vietcong Chasing Life Through the Woods and shooting his fucking back and all he wants to do is get to the fucking Chopper is getting shot in his back is getting up getting shot at getting up and you see this guy I love the fucking guy who just fucking fights and so I put these things in his reminders that you're going to have to fucking suffer man this fucking .25 minutes man you're going to have to fucking suffer her to go from this fat insecure motherfucker to one of the best guys on the planet Earth this journey is good take something that is going to be in comprehensible the most people and these different visualisations how I visualize myself talk if you came so nasty and dirty that I wasn't liked the fact that went .25 so if you came from being defeated to like man alright motherfuking maybe you know maybe Morgan go .75 you know it just became this different mind so I turned

<timemark seconds="2090" />

is an appositive who would even think about doing that so I was sitting at 297 who can't fucking shrim that great scarrier the fucking water we have to fucking ball pit balls to fucking man up quit a job and go and it put everything on himself so it's how I start talking to myself and put myself in a whole different category and that was to me the next day and I just kept using that as fuel in fuel no one would do this shit no one to do this shit a bad motherfuker around with with the right kind of message that I needed to hear that was never telling myself and Through Time

<timemark seconds="2131" />

I became reality to myself so you start out on the first day and then do start running again the second day in a secondary right back at it again but after I realized that for damn near professional cyclist with the miles I put on the bike so I never never watch TV I had to be doing something so I was riding a bike I rode a bike a lot to it take to lose the first initial kind of way cuz my bones were hurting so bad my body is broken and I try to swim a lot I want a great summer but putting equalize my body I went from negative point so I start feeling a whole bunch that's hours in the pool hours in the pool trying to get more and more comfortable not because I was going underwater I was so scared of water that I had to live in the water how to become one with the water so going to the pool you should scare me

<timemark seconds="2187" />

so I went to the pool awful awful lot and then the bike got easier I was able to run more I went from like 1 mile when I was a great accomplishment to my house and then from 2 to 3 was a bigger than I went from 3 to 6 and then like they were worn in order that they give people to get ready for butts in the whole thing was running 6 miles 5 days a week and that was my goal and so I just kept I failed I go back to scratch are you some positive motivation have like one day around like fucking defeated but I thought it was a part of the process this it probably had to realize this is part of my process versus just saying like I used to but not good enough if I'm not good enough we always say that shit that's not good enough to let me try something else I'm going to fucking make myself good enough and that became my mentality I'm going to make myself good enough and so I misunderstood a lot but that's that's all it came down to it I made myself good enough and the days

<timemark seconds="2247" />

run that far the next week I would do two-a-days so I can on the running if I ran 1/4 Mile I'll wait a couple hours it haunt me bother me I try to find a half-mile next time same day you can do more than this if I had to walk had to walk it if we can just a process of grinding and grinding and grinding a good word for it is that even a good word for and just just going further and further and then when I got through running I go to the bike I go to the pool if I got tired somewhere Malaysia tired I go to the gym and I developed this crazy work out what I was doing volume like to 300 reps of like very lightweight people say I have any like loose skin my workout routine that Jim became sick it became sick I was just doing to 300-400 wraps on my chest just like for one simple exercise the best press

<timemark seconds="2304" />

a racket get back on it just wrap it out trying to brush me to Kara's I can't build that muscle mass and I just became just became obsessed with it so when you doing this so you worried at all about repetitive stress injuries or the fact that your body is not conditioned for this and you're basically taking your body where you would have used it right and now you're you're forcing it to live like an elite athlete I didn't care didn't know any better I think about it while I did I I didn't know that working out that hard of a fuck you up

<timemark seconds="2338" />

I'll talk about a lot but the stress in my life getting to 24 cause we have some serious so as issues I know anything about this shit the psoas muscles with you since your hip flexor muscle and basically under stress it start to tighten up and I wish I stuttered for from the time I was in third grade at time I was in 7th grade white blotches on my skin I was just I was in that case it's all the insides of me also getting fucked up so in this process my psoas muscle got real tied to my T 12 I can show you the bump on the back of my head after the show's over but I had to start a go on this fucking like large tumor looking bump in the back of my head from my body compressors I'm six foot one of my muscles are like 5 foot 9 because I just started this the muscle tightness for my sore ass going to my T 12 I was just getting tighter my quads everything get tired from just stress the stress in my life so the more I stretch my body with the word

<timemark seconds="2398" />

my lower body to came out of balance so I had a bunch of stress fractures bunch of injuries going through Buds and how I got through buds was they getting my third time with my last time going through hell week I facing put a black sock on at 4 in the morning and I will get duct tape to had numerous stress fracture in both my legs because my my body was literally like coming in on itself in my legs like I was really bad and putting stress on my stress on my shins and so I would put duct tape duct tape my feet and I will show you the top of them but I have pressure ulcers that are size of quarters from you know how the ankle joint so the foot goes to the shin and how you move this with a taper so tight it just created a nice pulser right there and I just I just kept going through it support your ankles after the first 30 45 minutes

<timemark seconds="2458" />

cruciating but then it would go numb then I would go now

<timemark seconds="2467" />

does that do any long-term damage I've been out for 5 years so I retired from the other 21 years and no try this time in the Air Force and I did thought 16 years in the Navy how old are you 43 just like you're 30 that's good that's good you really do look very young for your age whenever I'm stressed I get after it fixed I fix would never bother me so I basically The Last 5 Years everything I've done in my life I did it be very unhealthy I've never talked about it I just kept going and it cost me pretty much I was choking my Inside Out adrenal issues X and generation use thyroid issues anything with endocrine system Prima shut down on me shutting down and I went from working out. And the doctors are trying to search what was wrong that's why I figure out the psoas muscle no one figured it out and I hit it by accident so I've missed 2 days of stretching out

<timemark seconds="2527" />

5 years and so what happened with all the shit I did to myself the stress I was under physical mental all kind of ship it is choke me out from the inside and doctors put me all kind of medication in the medications are doing the exact opposite of DHEA I was on some different things to for my estrogen different things for my arm I was on anything to do with your back with your endocrine system I'd like to rub in my throat from like the heart was always down the street my body was a jacked up couldn't sleep I hope I was just down shut down there to give you a lot more than just give me the app I was fucking dying

<timemark seconds="2577" />

and so I can do anything with a guy who is this guy to guy can't do shit and act like I don't know what's wrong with you is it PTSD is it was going on so I sat in the bed one day and I realize man my life is over this is it gave me time to reflect on everything I had a conference that was too man I am now working out what's the best time of my life cuz I got a chance to really reflect back and be proud of who I became I never took time to do that it was like one after another get the fuck after get after I get after you ain't good enough my forget after I get after it and I got haunted so anyway this process went on for a while more medication isn't working it's not working no doctor can figure it out I'm like fuck it I saw this doc about 8 years before this happened he was like a man you're so fucking tight I never seen

<timemark seconds="2637" />

body my life as hot as you 50,000 hours of stressing awesome crazy number

<timemark seconds="2644" />

I like whatever stressing you know it stretch dressing bad for you so it's up to you. I worked out so hard I have time to stress and I was wondering how to fix a weak back into work now as I was getting out your man I was working a full-time job and doing that to my body was literally getting Tighter and Tighter not just from what I was doing this now wouldn't that man stretch out so I don't do anything for like 10 minutes you know I'll do the 6 into a bathroom shit so I start stretching out for an hour and a half long story short man I shave my head almost every morning and that bump on back of my fucking head out for some fucking reason why I shave my head back and I was like this getting smaller

<timemark seconds="2699" />

tour the bump got healthier I got in the bed shake my damn life right now from stretching out while I was all it wasn't for my account the medications I was on. Do you ever do yoga all the time and all the time and I fight if I were to tell somebody one thing right now man. That's so as muscle and getting that hip flexor opened up does Ross Dress the fuck out it was so much worse than others it changed my life yeah how do you say how do you say his last name Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt from England Greek fella he has a great quote about yoga

<timemark seconds="2754" />

she said yoga is a martial art you do against yourself it's a great way of putting it feels like when you're in there right and so you how many years ago was this was 5 years ago half years ago I think and how long was there. Will you couldn't work out at all there was a half a mile apart should happen in a heart with a V and also I tried to pull ups every now and then but everything was just didn't have the energy I didn't have anything at me nothing with processing right for me so you think that you just broke in your body cause you pushed it too hard and how's your percent proud of myself and I'm very sick twisted even though people understand it I had to do

<timemark seconds="2810" />

so what I thought was capable like my first Ultra race I did I was I was heavier I was in Iraq your the Marcus Luttrell Lone Survivor I wasn't buds I was in three whole weeks as you know what I said I know a lot of guys that down the operation now I was at freefall school with Morgan the trail who's his twin brother during Operation Red Wings won Survivor well and I was about 200 some-odd pounds and I didn't run how did all this time I was a seal sounds like a bodybuilder and I did elliptical trainer 20 minutes on Sunday all I did so I didn't fuck that call yesterday I was never about it until this happened so that happened I was at man I got to find a way to raise money

<timemark seconds="2867" />

how do you spell list so I Googled it Foundation Special Operations Warrior Foundation in a Google the 10 hardest races in the world I do nothing about ultrarunning the first 20 miles at one time in the badwater 135 / 3 5 mile run through Death Valley in the summer time I thought was a fucking stage race I know people can run no idea what I'm passing the stage race will you run like 20 miles Chris kostman of the bad water and he said are you an ultra-runner and I was like I don't know what that is you guys have you got a hundred miles in 24 hours or less cuz I know I said I'm a Navy SEAL I was in 3D I gave him some resume he didn't give a shit I don't care you got qualified for my race and the deadline was up in 2 months this badwater race and basic

<timemark seconds="2927" />

he said there's two more races you can do to qualify and I might consider you my raise be slick top 90 a piece in the world and you have an ulcer on it but I like your calls like what you're doing he said come up on Wednesday and Eagles is a race on Saturday in San Diego San Diego one day would you want to run a 1-mile track for 24 hours so we can get you get a hundred twenty four hours I will consider you in my race I did the math 14 Summit mile fuck it I can do that

<timemark seconds="2958" />

dumb shit thinking I say that right now it was rough worst pain I've been in my chili for this race so I have my wife the time she know my ex-wife we go to Walmart get a blue lawn chair Ritz crackers in my complex that's only have 400 mile run so show up at the start line this race it was a UA national championships it's like the best Ultra Runners compete against each other to see me Majin get 24 hours and I'm just big bodybuilder looking gods of shirts and jacked up the fuk up there's a picture of me

<timemark seconds="3004" />

so basically I start running and I get to about my 40 mile 50 and I'm feeling pretty good I get to my 70 and it was the worst pain in my life I sat down this blue lawn chair model 70 and might the Ritz crackers after mile 22 can Ritz cracker balls I wouldn't hide written correctly I know what to do I'll drink your mouth Plex for my nutrition can I couldn't eat these Ritz crackers have very minimal water if any at all and I was just dying so I sat down this blue lawn chair as I was watching his runners go around this circle going to the bathroom and looked at my what's my body stopped my mind just went off and had to go to the bathroom and the bathroom is like 20 feet away from you if that and I couldn't that's why I sat

<timemark seconds="3064" />

MP blood down my leg and start cramping up my back and forth to go I am my feet were broken I was just in the were shaking once you stop running not running like that year I was just doing bodybuilding stuff in 20 minutes of elliptical trainer no running at all no shit no more than 50 miles to whole year

<timemark seconds="3091" />

that wasn't my thing I wanted to be like Jack and I didn't want to be cardio guy I want to be ripped big Navy SEAL guy

<timemark seconds="3101" />

in the day before this race is funny just got him Joe Burns you put me through my whole weeks still guys were the hardest guys out there he was in the gym the Friday before I did this race and he would do the full body squats deadlifts power cleans full body parkour Squad deadliest in everything with this guy because I knew he was going to come watch me in this race so I've always been about hot man you going to see me come in here and check this way in the mall you watch me do a hundred miles run

<timemark seconds="3140" />

what do you think about that so basically I paid for it so that much so you came out there with my favorite thing chocolate mini Donuts cuz you knew my story of my past life in but sick mini Donuts out there and I'll have my hat pulled down and that model 70 made was torturous and the blood on my leg and 30 miles to go

<timemark seconds="3163" />

start reaching the cookie jars man pulling off all kind of stuff I reached in my mind and a lot of us when we have bad times in life even the hardest person where we forget how badass we are during a hard time I have a thing where I take a couple seconds to reflect on how I am and you meant to send you this been through that you overcame it overcame that I don't ever close my mind to the fact that this can be done and I knew how to get up I need nutrition I need to hide race I need to get stop being dizzy so that's the first thing I did I didn't Panic on that 30 more miles to go to get a hundred I thought about the process slowly but surely as ever stand up and I was literally hobbling around the track was just walking no running at all I couldn't run my feet work in the worst pain is the worst pain I've been in my tire nothing in any training is even a comparable to this last 30 miles

<timemark seconds="3217" />

what happened was my ex-wife look that mean strike man time I was going way too slow and at that time at my 81

<timemark seconds="3228" />

something clicked that I'll never probably ever do again when my mind body spirit so everything is connected and my mind knew I wasn't fucking around him or he knew it wasn't going to quit I knew that guy was dead and buried in car to die out here on this fucking Walmart for for whatever reason why I was going to get through this motherfucker I don't give a damn it made trophy at the end I would even in a race in my mind it was nothing it was about nothing there was no nothing it was a bunch of people didn't know what the fuck I was it was me against me and I used all these different Dark Places to start bringing out light and just fucking going deeper and deeper and it burned the next 20 miles and miles and miles ran at about 10:30 Pace that I did a hundred more miles in 18 hours and 56 minutes

<timemark seconds="3282" />

sat back down that blue porta potty now my chair that got from Walmart and that's when the body realize I was done and this great feeling came over me but also the worst pain in my life that's what I took a humongous shit on myself literally like I like a fucking log up my fucking back just so much blood down in my wife was she was a nurse and she was freaked out I couldn't get up I couldn't stand up she back this Camry on the Knoll of the grassy areas at it we are both lifters at the time so she was easily put my arms around her neck she got the backseat of car that the window downtown smells like horrible shit and I had to start a lot of his November in San Diego so I'm sending Jack him and take his car and she was terrified to get the document to the doctor

<timemark seconds="3333" />

does it take me home to live in the second story or the second deck of this apartment complex in in San Diego I got to the first deck so I can I get a card I can stand up but with my arms when I was laying down too I was going to pass out got this second I got to the first deck went down just couldn't stand up anymore got to run her neck worked at my way up the railing walk to the kitchen area which is right in the front door I was laying in the poncho liner trap was everywhere I managed to help me manage to get into the into the tub and it's like dirt was coming out of my penis just looked horrible it's just a ghost in the world is worst pain I can ever ever ever be in my life and the crazy thing I tell you to do it because right now I'm not sadistic I'm not crazy loom I think that may be what they may want to put a title on me after hearing me because it makes them feel better

<timemark seconds="3388" />

because you think while he's got must be some special or just fucked up crazy dude no I'm a guy that came from nothing anybody's capable of doing shit like this anybody I said she's put the water on me to call my mom up my mom was dating doctor the time to talk to get him to a hospital now she came back in all I want to do is call Chris cost of the phone the restrictor valve on a sad fucking did it so she simply the doctor said no let me sit here in Georgia Spain

<timemark seconds="3419" />

what are you talking about I said you don't I go I need to go to doctor I realize that but I never thought

<timemark seconds="3427" />

it was humanly possible to do what I did I went 70 miles at 70 miles I was dead I was at 100% but I thought I thought was a hundred percent 31 more miles after being in the worst physical shape I've ever been in my life it all that all that pain and suffering thing was going to my fucking body and I sat in that tub and it was hit me and it was the most amazing feeling of accomplishment and I want to be numb

<timemark seconds="3463" />

I want you to give me drugs in the in the numbness fucking paid I wanted to I did this over in as the crazy as it sounds it was the most amazing moment of my entire life to overcome such to come from this kid who was Miss Lee Torsten suffer with torture used to this kid to Sky now who is able to overcome such amazing eyes and obstacles. Call Criss-Cross method race director of that water and he said the idea of a 24-hour races to run 24 hours you only read 19

<timemark seconds="3496" />

he put doubt in my mind that you would let me do that one so a month later or so about my other half later with his race car to hurt 100 200 mile race in Hawaii 26,000 feet of, he said that's all he said so crazy he's a hardcore dude and he said he might let you win he put enough doubt my mind say Matt I got to do more so I was broken I was broken bad and like how long does it take you to recover the funny thing about this out to the story very often I had signed up for. Duncan's that answer is right now

<timemark seconds="3539" />

when deployment in me and my wife my mom signed up for the first Las Vegas Marathon down the strip of Las Vegas

<timemark seconds="3546" />

and the incident happened so I ran a hundred miles before I ran a marathon 2 weeks later roughly December 5th was this Marathon that we all signed up for I couldn't walk I could not walk I was fucked up so 10 days or 2 weeks after this Hundred Mile and One race I did this Marathon December 5th Las Vegas I can't run maybe I can walk with my mom so I try to go out this little no around our grassy area San Diego Chargers run laser broke I said fuck I can't even put that on jet can't do shit so I said I said I'll try to rock my mom

<timemark seconds="3595" />

surface happen that gun went off 2005 14 days after I drop myself off and I qualify for the Boston Marathon route 308

<timemark seconds="3608" />

that's crazy it was funny about an old people are here safe my fucking even when I tell you the story I dropped and I want to drop so many names Google it look it up I don't give a fuck almost seems like I'm making my own story up it does it almost seems like the black dude from fucking Brazilian song about I just happened this happened three whole weeks Ranger school Red Hood your mouth put my feet but my body is able to tell my story he almost sounds like some made-up shit so yes I'm so crazy before you ever ran a marathon then you didn't run again at all and you still qualified for the Boston Marathon so you ran the 308 for the first marathon you ever did every two weeks after alright with no training and nothing in between

<timemark seconds="3668" />

you can see my training log to actually posted up so that's when I started training

<timemark seconds="3674" />

for the heart 100 so basically what happened was after that I had about 4 weeks what does it feel like to run that 308 if you could barely walk when that gun went off something off in my head and I didn't feel that much pain at all

<timemark seconds="3692" />

afterwards I did but something happened where I was like the gun went off and that thing came back like all right man

<timemark seconds="3701" />

what if I want to call if I could bought it that was my goal but I was I was jacked up you know and I and I didn't run as much as I should have it all over my erect training I hit the weights my goal was not signed up for the year early I want to qualify for boss was at 3 1059 I was like what if you can qualify for Boston now you trying to help me out I spent a hundred miles

<timemark seconds="3732" />

what the fuck is 26 miles to me now so the mindset going into was like I ran 75 more miles in this

<timemark seconds="3740" />

so I can use it to my advantage so after that happened I ran my feet pretty much broke out I'll go to the physical therapist and they had this compression tape compression tape help cuz I'm pretty bad off and I would run 70 80 hundred mile weeks and then I went to the heart 100 race in Hawaii 26,000 feet of climbing over a hundred miles on the top 5 hardest hundred mile race in the world about 2 months I want to run it out there and got through the race didn't 33 hours with a nice place finisher not many people finished at that year and I qualify for bad water and got in and I went on to lose weight and train hard and I got V my first year and went that mastectomy and got there when you see you went you lost weight but will you eventually way in

<timemark seconds="3795" />

so I went to the race about 190 she lost quite a bit of time that's over a short. Of time how did you lose all that way once again protein so much I got off I was on this stuff Carter nitro tech that I got all the protein stuff I started stop hitting the weights so hard I just became a running. Man pretty much pretty simple man that's what happen when you say you were using compression tape on your feet and that your feet were jacked up what was the extent of the injuries so basically because of my poor Nations I never figured out cuz my psoas muscles

<timemark seconds="3838" />

I always had issues with stress fracture shin splints so I put a lot of pressure on the inside of my ankles it so that there's a tendon that goes up the backside of your get your fibula my backside that that little bone on your foot it goes right beside that and that thing was just so floored up on both sides even if Lexie my foot was just killing me so I realize when you can you know when you pass that thing up Kathy my feet always help me out cuz it it it locked my foot into a position that would have been coded as much so between the casting of that and it was the a bad water video of 2006 you see me cross the finish line with this compression tape literally like flying on my ankles because I went to the race with compression tape on my ankles

<timemark seconds="3890" />

it so basically

<timemark seconds="3892" />

I have that on my on my ankles I had inserts in my in my shoes and also this wedge on the back heel of my left foot so that it would keep me from pronating that hill so much all that on just to go run and I ran my ass off and went to bed water 2006 and

<timemark seconds="3911" />

Amazon compression tape on my feet and walked a lot but I got 3rd place you always run with regular running shoes now I don't have those issues anymore all the stretching is open my body up to where it should have been pretty good it's not perfect so now I know you see the compressor in your see my ex-wife here in a second taking the compression take off of me she doing it right now see her right now she said tape so that's where every day of my life to run wow so as you see the story may be kind of unbelievable but there's some proof right there so that's not what I said as you see right now I'm trying to get a man I'm free just about there

<timemark seconds="3964" />

what is the most amount of Miles you've ever run at one time

<timemark seconds="3975" />

yeah I've had quite a few people on quite a few people now over the last year so that have run Ultras Courtney dauwalter you know she is she won the Moab okay I heard about her yes she she beat all the men by 22 Mi some like that some crazy thing she was first place winner should be everybody else with her and you would never believe it when you talk to her she seems so normal she drinks beer and eats nachos and needs candy she's just silly and she's fun and there's no demon they're not waiting to meet a demon you know I like how you getting through that some of the people that everybody I know that that can do that as a demon

<timemark seconds="4035" />

qualify in that race in Hawaii they just let you in after that like I did have 100 mile race I believe this I had 100 mile you did or you did the Vegas with the heart 100 did that hundred Miler and all this is in a very short amount of time December 26th in Las Vegas January was the next Hundred Mile and Hawaii fucking crazy that is like see if I was your friend and I called you up on October 20th I go hey man how many times you run my race schedule for 2017 pull up David Goggins race results because he's some real crazy and second I say this is good

<timemark seconds="4095" />

but just look at the dates of these races is so is he in a second

<timemark seconds="4100" />

it just look at the hundred miles and 50 miles back-to-back weekends how many week is it worth between races so if you look right here if you can't really see it 2007 you go all the way down

<timemark seconds="4112" />

keep on going to have the Seven Seals race is there to that okay get right there so how's your mother Hawaii a $50 a month later they looking at 14 days later another 50k 50-miler month later they look at left in the month another 50 miler 53 miles are in June July was another hundred Miler bad water was literally just that one it was a month after I did that hundred Miler house at 35 Marlette bill was less than a month after that water the plane 100 was 3 weeks after Leadville Angels Crest was to attend a the week after that I was your mother the bear 113 days after that hundred Miler and then I ran the 202 and 3.5 but I did Ranch what is 2 + 5 miles around there

<timemark seconds="4171" />

but what's not in there was that McNaughton race I didn't do that so that her and 50 mile race I also didn't 2007 that wasn't listed so that was just my 2007 years that's insane know now but fuck my body up as hell week really go through three whole weeks in one year so I was so happy when I realize that my body is really jacked up was I when I was a big-time squatter Squad and I went through the first hell week got messed up so I can look at you all the way through then throw with a guy with a guy died on Thursday and then the whole weekend it and I graduated pulmonary edema John stop

<timemark seconds="4220" />

it's cold as fuck hell week

<timemark seconds="4223" />

the Pacific Ocean never warm and it rained it the whole time the whole time is rain and he pretty much just drown us on fluid pretty much we were in the pool During the Revolution he sunk to the bottom his temperature was hot she missed a lot of hell week for getting pulled out for different stuff he went to quit and dine in hell week but yeah so anyway I'm going to go back to the gym and also second phase happened I face I got to get back in the gym so Jack and I wait I love Jack and wait and I realized I couldn't squat

<timemark seconds="4257" />

Subway from squatting a lot so I could even squat the bar cuz my lower back was all fucked up once I don't know what's going on it was cuz this this muscle so it hell week your hip flexors are so I went through so many of them so fast and so the hardest part of buds I went through 3 times not not the hell we part that's one of the hardest part but it was the initial part of the with everybody sees on TV tomorrow PT to serve torture the daggone boats over your head lot all that shit I went to that person 3 times in one year

<timemark seconds="4289" />

over pretty time my hip flexors got so tight that is Jack me up and jacked me up from my hip flexor so always being so cold and so stressed out and everything lit up to it but this really was the part that I noticed I can squat before hell week or before my first time going to Bud's after after buds

<timemark seconds="4313" />

finish Quantum or do you just think it might just be because your body was exhausted for 12 years like I said fuck I want to go out with your friends but I just couldn't squat cuz that that muscle is attached to your T12 so what was it doing to is it locking up or just going to sync my ass incredible pain and then with the weight pushing me down and then try to push up the pain was just is it too much so it's all this all Ranger Power Ranger Morphin issues yeah that's important thing for my friend cam Hanes it doesn't stretch he's another friend of mine who runs Ultra races here and that Moab 240

<timemark seconds="4360" />

please run the Bigfoot 205 East want a few of those I know he's listening go stretch dude if you working that hard right if you're doing that much I can make it barely touches toes that's not good you probably because I'm trying to get there I'm trying to get there so I stretch every night for these two hours does a thing two people said that always piss me off like that cuz I'm pretty flexible these are all well you're naturally flexible people have a natural threshold like no they don't like the doctor told me that I know you don't know what you're talking about I'm like you don't know what you talk about cuz most people don't push themselves past that painted that stretch I paying people want to put it exactly aren't usually flexible. You have to force yourself to do this and I know it because I had a friend my friend

<timemark seconds="4420" />

Palmer dog know he was a football player Jack big thick dude terrible flexibility was taking taekwondo with me and over the course of a couple years I saw that dude eventually develop a full split yes was everybody else is done training that guy would be on the mat constantly stretching always working out cuz he had built his body up so strong all those years of squatting and lifting could help that he just know he's all tense and then he was just like this super powerful but all a very tense that's why I stopped I never stress cuz I think you're not supposed to stretch before you do big physical activities because I think it does like we can use someone but I don't think being flexible overall makes you weaker doesn't from martial arts because you need that flexibility to have leg dexterity to be able to kick it's got to be fluid where it's not tightened up by the Restriction of the motion of your body

<timemark seconds="4480" />

for whatever reason and I'm one of those drone on too much about yoga I'm like one of those vegans it's like you got to do it man I just checked so I'm getting that way now man you know if you do anything like weightlifting type shed or martial arts type shyt where it's just everything's explosion lifting too heavy to push push push it out recently that was something along the lines of hot yoga is just trendy nonsense I read that and then even in the article talked about that there might be some benefits and terms of like the strengthening your arteries and they didn't even mention heat shock proteins is a study going on right now I believe it's at Harvard one of my friends was telling me about it where they're they're trying to find the benefits of 90 minute hot yoga class

<timemark seconds="4540" />

cuz they think it might mirror The observed benefits of sauna was they already know for a fact has big benefits because of your body producing heat shock protein to do with the heat that's why I put that song in here man I go in that fucker all the time when no one can tell me doesn't work that's a big change my medication or disorder combined change it but I just think it balances out your body in those static poses we just holding those poles and it just works you out in a weird way then you just don't get lifting weights or hitting the bag or anything I use not going to get that that kind of working out anymore it's so difficult those are just what your ass off you inject struggle assembly did nobody knows it's like if you see like to doorways right and one of them is like fucking CT Ali Fletcher's fucking Super Pump iron addicts gym

<timemark seconds="4600" />

which is hard work and then right next to it is once you get done with all that hard work you go over to that you know joke two different kinds of hard work so what do you do now in terms of like you got over this

<timemark seconds="4619" />

5 years ago you're in this bad situation with your body's not working right now everything's working great again I had two heart surgery also so so you know you supposed to hold your heart be a seal it was born with it pushing so hard so I'll try to finish Race Across America and another for my life with the whole active-duty seal for 3 years if they're trying to fix it to the hole with significantly large like how big they say it was as big as a quarter of the hell is a big as a quarter that the huge patches that I'm a heart so the two stents what is a helix patch it is like a little mesh very like what they do for hernias it's not mine or maybe something like that

<timemark seconds="4679" />

small artery Play Dispatch but they go through your artery artery or the camera too much more artery went to my heart they went and they took the Helix patch that they place it in there and then they found out 6 months later at the whole wasn't covered up enough you can always this I mean in the Hills pass was very damn big say it too late to go back in there in 2010 Hatchet hear your heart I guess your heart heals around the patch but how did they stick it in place I guess they put it where the holes at and then it kind of like in flights the holes that goes in there and then it kind of a hole in the heart so there's 2 things in my heart right now that the heart is going to cover it up okay

<timemark seconds="4739" />

so it's attached to this little probe right and then they put it over the area where the injury is

<timemark seconds="4746" />

wow that's insane atrial septal defect that I have atrial septal defect so amazing everything I've done I don't got from Edison shit's crazy crazy they could do that so I was out for 3 years so I stuck a recruiting area for 3 years trying to get back on active duty and that's why was my last three years so they put that patch in and now your heart 200% it's 100% I was that off it's just amazing that you were able to do all that with a hole in your heart that's what the doctors are saying and the EK geez all this stuff once again after I ran like 25 miles you know

<timemark seconds="4806" />

so the doctor. Shrek is a Keno game because you go to the doctor get an echocardiogram I'm in there just chilling out and the guys talking to me have the little one in my heart for bullshittin about stuff and he when people get quiet as one of my heart chilling out

<timemark seconds="4833" />

and he says I'll be right back he goes and gets a doctor doctor comes in first thing I'm a heart

<timemark seconds="4841" />

doctor gets another doctor

<timemark seconds="4843" />

now I'm just freaking the fuck out I'm like okay can we come to your heart when I was big deal so they come back in and say hey we can stop the echocardiogram when you talk to you in the hallway you have a hole in your heart and the guy didn't know that I was in u.s. Navy got all things as a CEO cuz not many black guys are seals and you get a conversation about know we got fixed this real quick I said yeah I mean I want to see you he said man you could have died jumping you can die diving you could have died in all this stuff is basically the whole in your heart if it gets plugged with something like anything like you don't listen to get a bubble from diving or something like that because I so I called luck I called love surgeries they put it back on I lost the give you the first one and then how about when do they realize it's not. Not good enough so they take you back in a bubble study a bubble test

<timemark seconds="4903" />

safe bubbles that way to see if the bubble goes through your heart so they have this echocardiogram again and they hook you up I think to Ivy or something like that and I throw these bubbles through your heart and they see if it goes through after 6 months going to Sleep Inn Hewitt up the bubble went through so I had to tell me where Dan hey we got to you know you're not you're not good to go so I had to take a year before I have another surgery because you wanted to get that patch at it be completely completely healed so they can go to all this time you knew you had a whole right so it's because of the heart surgery all this time like when you're waiting for a deal you know you have an extra hole on the go you know do how you feel comfortable and so you know that the whole is not going to kill you right now but you can't. You can't jump you from sweating steal anymore so I was recruiter for a.

<timemark seconds="4963" />

so basically I was crazy about that is before my second surgery I was actually training for Delta Force I want to go to Delta and I was rocking rock running a lot and before my second run with a Pacquiao pack of my back was so late or not have his back 50 60 lb and you run with that on your supposed to hike or Humpback Rock helping I ran with it because I wouldn't cuz you know that's what I did so the day before the day off the day of heart surgery I did a Ruck run because I knew I was giving out of commission for a while so fuck it matter get my last one in dude Jesus Christ so I could do I have not have my training logs after my second heart surgery I could do was walk so I became an ultra Walker

<timemark seconds="5015" />

what I want my fucking ass off and it's over. Time it took a year for that thing to heal up and heal you help my first Bible study at my second heart surgery came back negative or positive the bubble went through again no crack me open and I passed the second level test so the first bubble test was how long after a year it was so the first bubble test after the first surgery for 6 months and then you had to go through a full 6 months after that after I totally heal then you have the second heart surgery and when does the bubble test fail after the second heart surgery it was about 6 months Jesus Christ you know I'm sorry to inform him ever hit the crack your chest open the next time you need to get in there and so I sat back thinking it would be a third heart surgery

<timemark seconds="5064" />

is there an app that one they said we have to wait for six months to see if this thing is going to close up right I came back thinking man bout to get cracked open and that bubble

<timemark seconds="5077" />

got pinned up man go through maybe force it through tomorrow and I know right. It's crazy when a Ruck run with a hole in your heart to but I did it for several years I said fuck it I'm about to keep on going man

<timemark seconds="5097" />

that's amazing after all said and done everything is good now it's the best day of my life because life bucket life comes at you dude so I mean I would go to guy for injuries like if anybody said I've had them all world record for chin up then you rip you apart pull-ups and chin-ups our hands for a half or so I fell 3 times fell twice before I finally got it that their time and

<timemark seconds="5152" />

the first time I ripped the shit out of my forearm and then the second time you'll see there's a picture of my hand and it is a third degree burn so that's my hand oh Jesus man what in the fuck is going on with your bit by a wolf so what's funny about that is he see that that doesn't create after 1 pull up so if you can imagine the pain of cuz I know you have one contact Point that's it running you can overcome it cuz he was big giant legs and front it's different when you have these little punk ass hands touching the bar imagine 4030 pull-ups how many times you're coming on that bar coming off at the time I was a bigger guy now so I was 22 pounds heavier so I was a lot bigger than I am right there and get that shit man so you were doing it in sets of 5 sets of 5 so

<timemark seconds="5212" />

I have these different people who are witnessing you you have to have your your your number there to make sure that you're you know qualify for the Guinness Book of World Records 1450 Avalon way to Governor 4015 pull up to your heart Jesus Christ so yeah and how long did you do this over 24 hours it was 7

<timemark seconds="5238" />

what does it feel like in the last chin up you know what actually is a video that we have and I was chasing this guy named Steven Highland so just getting Stephen have had the record and the video is my last 3 + 4 broke the record I'm talking so much shit this motherfucker motherfucker we talkin shit it's a cool video but I felt I felt nothing I was just happy to have to do I just 67,000 pull ups in 9 months training for a record for 4000 and the failures I did the first time of September failed miserably I was the date of the 2588 or something like that to people

<timemark seconds="5285" />

too much later November tried again failed again 2 months later in January 19th I finally fucking got it so after I got it wasn't like I'm happy cuz like I ain't got you more fucking pull-ups anymore Rodger that salt was that if I can check that

<timemark seconds="5307" />

can I watch it now surprise me dude that's the part of the man I like doing what you can get some get me to knock some out like if they smell it they'll get disgusted like I like Jagermeister or something like that and they smell it is that what it's like with you would like if you don't believe it but you know what I was out the big guy twice in my life so hit the reason why I just don't like running man it hurts it's brutal it sucks going out and only gone for 2 hours or 49 hours

<timemark seconds="5347" />

the fuck I'm not crazy man it's just sucks people put me in this category you must be some crazy guy who loves it take these classes I'm in the class about this was Jason shoptalk elephant one bite I'm breathing control Rodger that you gotta put yourself in a relationship relation it's a lifestyle how are you going to react how you going to react to it that's all that training was out the fucking door when you're in a fucking cold water and your fucking miserable at the first hour of 130 hours of Hell Week in that first wave goes over your head and your the coldest you been in your life and your mind goes from Hour 1 Hour 1 fucking 30 all that fucking self talkin shit dude anything about these about getting a fuck out of here but if you live this shit on a daily basis and you want to call me or mine down the self-talk will help all that stuff will help but usually react

<timemark seconds="5407" />

we have pain we have supper movie Act and react about get the fuck out of here we got to go it's those people able to control that fucking feeling a fucking flight is a normal fucker there's a way through this is not going to be your forever I'm not cold right now I went to three of them I'm not cold now I'm in a nice warm to deal with you you got to think about that shit that's just going to end up going to bed but we don't know that we don't think that at that time this will last forever and then you get to sit back on Friday there by walking across the you know back on the grinder all the 16th 17th and guy that graduated hell week need a chance to watch these guys Victorious and then you get a chance thank about that you take that hot warm shower birthday comes your fucking mind why the fuck did I quit so what keeps me going I've quit but thanks I know what's on the back in the fucking quitting it's a lifetime I think about why the fuck did I do that

<timemark seconds="5463" />

and I fucking do nothing this something about talking to a guy like you that a lot of people hope that you're going to say some magic thing that's going to click in their brain everybody gets change who they are like what is it what is the thing that's why people go to these self-help conferences and they take these classes and they hope that someone's going to say something and it changes the way their mind works it's hilarious to me it is it's kind of hilarious to me too but what is also hilarious is that what you're saying is that you have to do those things you have to suffer you have to live in it you have to be comfortable in it and then maybe some of that shit will help you a little bit of on the way. And I was still recruit I got invited to a mighty smart ass motherfuckers there man I'm not that I'm a cigarette

<timemark seconds="5522" />

there was this guy that I forget his name but he was like the top head old white guy you know all all genius doubt everyone this panel and they were asking us all these questions about the mental toughness and she was answering them I was answering any questions I'll never forget he was his answer them off of know how the fuck am I work since you're not going through hell just a kid and then all way up until now so I know that theory is bullshit yeah there's a lot of good stuff out there you can read from people but I lived help it when you put yourself in hell that's the only time you can figure out how to fuck to get through that motherfucker you can't you can't read somebody else's book about some theory of how to do shit some guy who set up another nice warm office and Retin-A wrote some book with nice cup of coffee in the fucking hang up I want to see that guy

<timemark seconds="5582" />

Marston self in fucking hell and he thought about quitting and leaving and his wife and his kids and why am I here is it is it worth it all this crazy shit is still said If found out a way to get through it so basically that's that's the bottom line of it all we all want to read about how we can quickly get somewhere that's why the six minute abs so powerful you make it some results from it but they're not permanent the permanent result comes from you fucking I say it all the time you have to suffer

<timemark seconds="5619" />

you have to make that a tattoo on your fucking brain so that hard time comes again you don't forget it

<timemark seconds="5628" />

you may forget it for a second but you can go back in the cookie jar call it's a it's something that we've all endured I called the cookie jar and we often forget how hard we are but you got to reflect back to pick up with respect I've been through this I've been through that and then remind yourself I'm a bad mother fucker

<timemark seconds="5645" />

and then you can get you that shit but if you don't believe it you have an indoor shit you're just blowing smoke man and you not going to get to me what was this guy saying there is was about I forget exactly what the Mind does under stress

<timemark seconds="5663" />

and how we can't he said how we can't do something and I did it I did what he said we couldn't do it what was he saying couldn't do it was

<timemark seconds="5677" />

if you're born a certain way somebody if you're born a certain way you can't become this way it was totally saying that would who I am now like I had to do more with some not genetic power or some some gift from God that I had to have some kind of special gift that has some kind of special do not forget what set me off because we had to be treat you to be somewhere you had to be born with it was the concept and I know what I was born with and I know the battle that I had in my mind so when he said it I said to look at my face in some of the crowd ask me question. I totally count addicted everything you said I was like nah man I mean I fucking know for a fact that you can be this fucked-up dude really fucked up dude and with the right mindset and it is it is it sound so easy with the right mindset doesn't sound easy

<timemark seconds="5737" />

where is simplistic answer you can you can but you have to go into a dark chambers that we often shut off and you got to open up your open up at 5 that fucking demon get in there talk that mother fucker say what's up and we often take the we all like to take this four-lane highway the easy Highway has has fucking signs that has restaurants we all love that for the highway we always step over the shovel

<timemark seconds="5765" />

it all I did was I pick up that fucking shovel and shovel I made my own path and you may have big boulders and shit they need to get in 200 miles of the road faster than you but going through this path of Life The Journey over here that you make yourself that's incredibly difficult but comes out the other end of that mother fucker and some glorious shit that you can't even explain to people and we're afraid

<timemark seconds="5788" />

bottom line is most of us even the people have all these theories and shit it's easier to accept the fact that I'm just not good enough I wasn't made to do that and yes I'm fucking James birthday right now man we can do a lot of shit when it comes just pure on cuts and willpower and getting through shit we will lot more with a lot more than we think we have the other problem with a guy like that with his theories his theories are based on results and those results are based on human beings and most human beings there certain people that are born with certain gifts like a guy like LeBron James obvious physical Talent you know Jon Jones MMA obviously physical count but there's

<timemark seconds="5829" />

when you look at someone who's super successful you always assume that it has to be because of some sort of physical gifts because people look at themselves and I'm sure this doctor this old dude probably had like a little gut and probably have tiny arms weak shoulders and it probably thought well there certain people that are just mesomorphic and probably broke it down only scientific terms you know they they they just have fast twitch muscle fibers and they say all this crazy shit that is true at the very highest levels of the winners right but it doesn't mean that you can become that just means it's too painful for most people to go through so very few people ever get there so if you look at the actual results he would be correct but he's not correct cuz she doesn't take the shovel that's. The more the story does not some easy lit up street light right with nice smooth roads right is a difficult mother fucker would you going to fail and you could be in your head you could be

<timemark seconds="5889" />

and I'm not good enough and it's how you get through that is how you get through that on a daily basis with nothing I say man I'm 43 I've done so much you start to become civilized the refrigerator gets for you start making money and you start I'm not getting cold anymore I'm retired and have 40 people shouldn't be playing basketball or football or are you start to believe this shit and it becomes in your fucking mind like there's people who are retiring you know if 47 years old 37 years old at 40 weeks to do in thousands of pull-ups 2002 push-ups cuz I'm not allowing myself to become civilized the worst didn't happen to a man's We Can Save A Lot you lose that fucking fight you why the fuck am I doing this shit I'm good you ain't good man you ain't never fucking rot and that's just my mentality you may have more but you never fucking a ride

<timemark seconds="5949" />

common people

<timemark seconds="5951" />

uncommon among son, people's one of the greatest ways to put it if you're like for me what got me in trouble with the Navy Seals if I want to be one so bad so bad I thought my ass off that's all those uncommon people

<timemark seconds="5976" />

I want to be uncommon the most uncommon people I wanted to be the guy I don't care if you fucking like milk if you understand me I don't give a fuck once I went through this fucking Journeys path of life you ain't got a whole bunch of fucking guys that don't fucking lie to me I don't give a fuck I'm a warrior. There's like I've been a lot more combat to me A Warrior's not always at war is a mother fucker says I'm here again today I'm here again tomorrow or the next day I'm 50 years old and still function after it is important to put no fucking limit on West possible that's what got me in trouble. That's why I went to Ranger school as a seal that's why I try to go to Delta Force twice you know why I've been I've been through all these different training programs that I was looking for in the military

<timemark seconds="6025" />

in the training these people get their ass handed to him after they get out a lot of them get civilized

<timemark seconds="6032" />

I always wanted to go back in the training where I was at I want to go back to war in the war was in that training program where you see guys you can quit guys who are brutal got you a surfer guys were you ghost as a seal you don't volunteer for Ranger school I did I put in seven ships got turned down a street getting you got accepted I went at 28 29 years old and they go why did you go. Started becoming civilized I thought of becoming complacent I need to get my fucking ass kicked again and when you go at the seal Goin Down to it you have no ranking Ranger school you can be a major you just fucking Joe Brown you nobody and you not eat and you're not sleeping so I always put myself I would embarrass myself and shit like that even I will climb the ladder

<timemark seconds="6079" />

got it officially fall back down that mother fucker that's alright man getting soft dude getting soft kick your fucking ass again and you know it's kind of process did you find resistance from that amongst other guys that didn't like to make that you were making them uncomfortable because that is something that people there's a natural instinct that people have when someone's working harder than them to the diminish that person well I know that a lot of guys allow me for a lot of reasons and I realize that I am a guy that doesn't care if you like me or not alpha male and your gift other off of males and we eat your own Alpha Mills eat their own I love that shit

<timemark seconds="6121" />

fucking go man I want to eat it at 8 man I'm all about that kind of mentality but I was sometimes take it to another level of a good old boy Network for too long in my life and it got me in trouble for trauma left I want to be accepted if you fucking like UFC and I did it I love it I love it maskell fucking watch me be my friend be my buddy that fucking weak ass shit I found out through this path of Life who is David Goggins who am I to go to a loan there was a fucking trophy on the fucking wall that mantle that's always my fucking brain no one help me get to know I pay my fucking bills or that shit from you don't know where man was fucking the fucking weight with you I suffered on my own and developed this man who said who I am an

<timemark seconds="6175" />

very competitive Ultra compared to do that take it what you want man like all that personal sovereignty exactly was not a lot of people that have that there's a lot of people that change who they are depending upon what people want from them that's that's me that's important man in most people struggle their whole life to find out who they are struggle there hold their whole life to find out what defines them what they actually enjoying what they don't start putting yourself in situations that suck yourself I've gotten from paying attention to you is that you what you're preaching what you're talking about is finding yourself through struggle what do you find out if you like to swim that's why you want to do is swim

<timemark seconds="6228" />

what are you finding out

<timemark seconds="6230" />

put the people talk about triple down on your fucking strikes that's the fucking we cash it in the world triple down your fucking weaknesses the goodshit you another happy shit that's why I might on my face because she talked about Good Times you know how to get to that shit motherfuckers get you a copy I would tell you how you can help yourself get through the times that suck real life this is real life 90% of your life will suck

<timemark seconds="6266" />

Man I'm not special I just stop listening to that voice to talk so fucking aggressive people do you believe in God you cuss so much

<timemark seconds="6306" />

what I say fuck it is is that you know what I'm thinking if I try to make it all pretty and shit that's not what my life was it was a violet Violet trouble daily to get where I'm at today I'm not going to water down like water down she wasn't fun it ain't fun today I'm happy don't you think that your happiness is probably elevated by the amount of pain that you've gone through a hundred percent so the amount of suffering you understand the amount of pain that you've gone through makes you appreciate the happiness and the Beautiful Moments with much more intensity that's what week people miss about my story meet people here this soft cast on my God you must be miserable on my God what the hell is wrong with them you're missing the fucking story you're not listening to the story man

<timemark seconds="6360" />

look what I overcame if that is a put some badge of honor tattooed in your fucking brain for the rest your life you can die today talking to Joe Rogan you're missing the story man am I happy what the fuck do you think don't miss it don't misunderstand the passion which I speak for not being intensely happy happiest person in the world but I'm not done so I can speak to you like all man everything is great. I have a lot more shit to do that worship to do with this is in the same use of the word that you used the Warrior's mentality the Warriors life right this is this is the way that you can keep balanced and saying right and and keep a good grip on who you are. Here's a quote that was said I don't know who said it those are great quote this guy said

<timemark seconds="6414" />

going to combat going to war by the hundred men that go on the war tensioning fucking be there 80 of them are just targets 10 do most of the fighting one is a warrior

<timemark seconds="6430" />

it's a true quote to life I saw it going to train I saw it everywhere I went there so many people that show up to life that shouldn't even fucking be around you people do all the work I want to be part of that 9 I'm working towards being that one and that's just how I live my life know what are you doing with your life these days right now I'm very routine I give every morning run I go to the gym and then at night time I stretch out I am just trying to develop a business card to me a lot of money trying to do that I'm just getting out I'm a I'm an introvert so I never want to get on social media I'm not big on that I'm big on being

<timemark seconds="6475" />

I can run a mile babe I'm going to 215 fucking miles to Fort I've been asleep she doesn't matter I want you to see how fucking far you can go and that's all it's about yourself and that's what all comes from guarantee you've already done that what you experience from watching a television show and what what got you out the door would got you to sort of take the first step to change your life will you experience by watching Rocky would you expect those those moments of inspiration those are critical for people they need to know that someone's done something that someone's done something that's greater than they would they can imagine themselves doing and they want to take it a step towards trying to be better.... Inspirations gigantic and sometimes it comes across as corny you know people read too much of it online it because it becomes a drowns out if you lose it the meaning gets lost Minnesota and there's a lot of posers is a lot of people out there that are pretending that

<timemark seconds="6708" />

trying to offer up inspiration or a true honest account of their experiences but really what they're trying to do is say something that's going to get likes you now they're trying to say things that they think people going to go yeah double high-five you know there's a thing that people are doing when they're just trying to just get social cred right Ryan picture picture of my fucking real life. Is fuel for people it's fuel for me I mean I thought I love that she and I live off of it there's a lot of people that I follow them online and you're one of them that I can get something out of that I could watch a short clip of Utah gun show clips of this podcast people going to play these clips go for fucking crazy runs after work I hope so it's going to happen what is this business you doing

<timemark seconds="6765" />

what is my own Goggins loc basically I invested in myself I'm invested in myself in I hope that this story is can can change somebody's life not to be me cuz I ain't about me and I and I I try to be as real as I can because we're all fucking suffering in this world we're all hurting and I tried to take away all titles you want to give me that you know that I did not come from that shit that's right to be so authentic and so real about my own insecurities I'm not gifted I'm just driven it's all about trying to share that message with people is all about you know I speak to a lot of people and that's what I do now and how you doing it as a business I do some motivational speaking but you know right now I'm not rich I make a lot of fucking money I'm just trying to build a brand of authentic as possible because I don't want to build it

<timemark seconds="6825" />

too fast cuz my my biggest fear in life is people can be right through a motherfucker that's not real I do it all the time like a lot you have these great quote tonight and it and they Mass produce

<timemark seconds="6837" />

I can't master do something man and they have these great quotes and shit but are you living that mother fucker what you just quoted and how powerful it may sound are you getting up every fucking more about working at whatever are you really getting the fuck after are you just talkin to motivate people Brian and I don't want to be that guy to pretend that you wish shopping made a lot and they talked this shit and they're off this until it's gone boys bullshit bullshit man wake up get what you're saying and then it comes to people can see what I talk to real talk so fucking dispassionate cuz I'm reliving my fucking life

<timemark seconds="6887" />

are we living this morning when I got up I want to do that shit I'm reliving everything I did and I can't speak to you like all the time and shit just sucks it sucks that's what I'm talking about like to see man got you so calm right now what the fuck is wrong with you I'm not going back through that shit man that I'm not going back to the the suffering and shitted it took to become who I just ran to the point where I can slowly hopefully make people from motivated to driven cuz motivation is scrapp shit people right now maybe go run if it's cold out somewhere were there at a lot more for the shut that door go back inside that's motivation it comes and go as how you feel if you and your wife were good if you and your kids are good if you're good at work you're motivated

<timemark seconds="6936" />

I like a motherfuker whose life is imploded ain't got shit in life and says

<timemark seconds="6943" />

still got fucked it after today man so it's about so that's when you move from motivation to driven to obsessed and I want people to realize once you get to the portion of it over here at the gym access part. This commitment that you have to authenticity is one of the reasons why people are connected to what you meant your messages that's one of the reasons why what you're saying you don't want to grow up too fast you don't want it to be bullshit you're terrified of that thing just like we're talking about was weak people you terrified of seeing that weakness in yourself right you know that we all see that we've all seen motivational things that are bullshit we've all talked to people that are talking and you realize there's nothing really that they're connected to the not really connected to their words the words just a bunch of words to piece together cuz they sound like something that someone who's you know enlightened on the subject would say

<timemark seconds="6994" />

yeah I just doesn't doesn't connect at all so your struggle now is to try to figure out how to stay you and get the message out but still be fully connected to that message you know it's not so much a struggle because I'm not really about

<timemark seconds="7013" />

I'm not driven by the business I'm not I'm not trying to be I make a very small salary for being retired from the military that's all I need so I'm not fast to I'm a minimalist motherfuker give me a backpack a fucking ground asleep on and a pull-up bar in a fucking some running shoes in a Subway sandwich or some shit no fucking straight so it's I believe patience patient dude I can watch the piece of grass grow 20 years cuz I know that

<timemark seconds="7046" />

it is how you get somewhere in life by being that look like mentality and be able to watch something very scholarly patiently and that's all I'm doing right now about money it's about people know me I'll kick you like me whoever wants to hear this is out there it's also your your your goal is to grow this and you goes to grow this in order to impact people. It's not about me what do you get out of impacting people

<timemark seconds="7079" />

it's a good question I don't get anything out of it I'm going to but you must get something they must be personal satisfaction must be a connection to those people who must be it must be enriching to you it's hard to connect with people cuz there's quite a few now they're coming in it's it's my duty is my duty to share my stomach is somebody who discovered a new Earth in a water source in the food source I discovered a whole nother part of your fucking brain

<timemark seconds="7115" />

a lot of people don't even know about is my job at being a fucking on this journey being the discovery person didn't even the person that discovered this part I discovered a very important part that I haven't met many people that have discovered this part that I'm sure there's a lot out there that's my job now to take these weak people in the category 2 hours in stop reading the Bullshit stop listening to the bullshit

<timemark seconds="7142" />

success can impact somebody it is my job is my duty to show this to as much as I'm not really fond of it I'm not the kind of guy wants to sit in the fucking room and just be just leave me alone by myself is who I am about to get uncomfortable and tell people all this shit is needed to get those good tell me about it out of 4th grade reading level high school I stuttered I lied to people to be the fucking friends

<timemark seconds="7172" />

so good it doesn't feel good at all but maybe somebody is doing the same shit

<timemark seconds="7178" />

and maybe they can realize wow that mother fucker was a piece of shit you fucking now is it a Navy SEAL retired guy runs his mouth was 297 pounds in poker in wow in truth I was a fucking pathetic motherfuker my people cannot say that to themselves just we have to choose these great fucking magical words that that makes that that make people feel good tell yourself the truth it's going to cause you fucking fat then maybe bullying you but you might be fucking fat

<timemark seconds="7215" />

I called you dumb it's me but you might be fucking dumb

<timemark seconds="7220" />

it's like man take it for what it's worth and change it and that terrible feeling when someone does tell you they have fat you can use that as fuel. And that's all this is about it and where it goes if it goes somewhere and never will you said something that I think of when I run and it's at most people quit at 40%, 40% real man I love that quote 40% rule my heart surgery and I developed that to that first ones at my run and I thought I had given hundred percent I'll set it up I thought I'd give it a hundred percent and to go to At Last I go mad I wouldn't even near a hundred percent so I came up with this thing called the 40% rule is Basie where you is like a car you put a governor on a car and they said the car can go 1:30 that Governor stop the car at 91

<timemark seconds="7280" />

I am driving thinking I want to fucking floor if I can't go I can't go any faster with you at your brain we put a girlfriend a brain send me feel pain discomfort suffering all those words that we hate to say cuz we in this happy peaceful world we live in now we stopped we slow down and if you can get through these different barriers and game 5% 2 % 3% that 40% become 60s certificate you can 70 80 90 and then you'll hopefully one day near 100 I don't I don't know if you can probably at a hundred more store though I love that I think a true I think that's a hundred percent true I think when you were laying in a tub you knocked on the door that is 100% true no one is ever get that is on for the truth I didn't give a hundred percent and that was it 1 mile run I did for the first time so that's the scary thing that's the scariest thing in the world I didn't die you probably gave 99.99999
