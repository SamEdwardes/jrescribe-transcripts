<timemark seconds="411" />

 I feel

<timemark seconds="412" />

 pretentious want to do that like I'm pretending I'm one of them everybody white people say the night they say Lanai it's awesome Paradise call what you want my good buddy Cameron Hanes

<timemark seconds="425" />

 The Joe Rogan Experience

<timemark seconds="429" />

 boom and we live back from Hawaii right before it fucking blows up and sinks into the ocean just in time we barely made it when we were flying above the Big Island as we're flying above it what's the matter

<timemark seconds="448" />

 as we're flying above the Big Island a 6.9 earthquake blew up and I want like explode and sink at least I mean we had a bigger that's what it is I mean the whole thing's a fucking volcano people shocked the volcanoes volcano I was looking at the map of the way we fly so we can't see it the entire way which is bullshit cool I even asked a guy like a which way do we go that would be fucking awesome for flew over that thing who fuck living on a volcano

<timemark seconds="507" />

 is beautiful we were on Lanai and interesting place in Deer right and until you do the math you think hey this is going to be gravy way more for sure this is one of the best examples of if you want to make an argument for hunting like this in in certain situations this is probably the best example you must control the population is animals they don't have any predators and they evolved around Tigers they come from India so these Axis deer they were a gift from Hong Kong to King Kamehameha V I know your history and I was getting all into it today and I want to make my post about as also I'm so date that they shoot

<timemark seconds="569" />

 play shoot a week just to just to meet people and control the population said 1500 but not a week was it a day right because I have to go at night with night vision scopes goes to take him out just to take him out to dinner that's so many deer when we were there at night we got the first of all we got super lucky thanks to you you let me take that deer and we went to scout we got out of the car we went and looked around and within 5 minutes we saw a buck in it in adorable spot it just gives you a distorted perception of your chances of success though yeah until the last day but then 15 minutes I got the first deer but when you get there you realized how switched on these things so yeah

<timemark seconds="626" />

 like there's there's nothing like these things so it's at you know I've hunted in Africa in it and the antelope there are pretty quick also just like that but just because of lions and hyenas are super jumpy Twitchy but these deer are very similar so quick when we were leaving that night when you and me and Adam were in the truck we're leaving and we turn the lights on the truck and you could see hundreds of deer in front of us was the craziest like it was like a crowd being let out of a concert or something yeah basketball game crossing the road into the open field where we've been hunting and it's just hundreds you can't imagine if you haven't been any can't imagine if you if you move there or if you just went there for a few days you kind of get it you be like okay what are you doing about these things when you can't give him birth control I mean they eat grass so like how are you going to stop them from breeding you're not so we can do we can introduce Tire

<timemark seconds="687" />

 crystalline I may be the only way to do it good deer meat I was thinking about it to that stretch or those Hunters a deer cross the highway you know that's I mean it's a straight as can be you can see

<timemark seconds="706" />

 I mean great visibility but the speed limit is 35 I think it's because the deer are always jumped out in front of cars there oh yeah I'm sure would be dying so it's it seems like why you should be 70 but somebody dear it's also because they like where you going slow down people in the island maybe that was part of it too. I'm so relaxed and the people are so friendly that's an awesome awesome place it was thankful for the experience and and Ferb seen animals but also meeting the people you know what's Alec Bob The Butcher they're just like these people that are ingrained in her in your memory and yeah that's it that's such a special part of the trip also experience is very very unusual because

<timemark seconds="763" />

 there's really not a place like that that I know of anywhere on the planet that's just a small island with a small population of people in a massive population of the most delicious animals in the world and even though there's so many of them good fucking lock getting one we had my friend Ben O'Brien he went home empty-handed so one of us in a group of very experienced hunters in other than me everybody in that group is super super experience damn you know and still is no Cakewalk these things are switched on and they Dodge arrows like they're in the Matrix me to Crazy there's no gimmes no I mean it's so you can do everything right you can you can think in your head why I travel all the way here I'm here too hun I need to take me home doesn't matter those dear there's no gimmies they are trying to stay alive and they know what's up they get hunted I don't know if it's everyday because when they

<timemark seconds="824" />

 when their antlers fall off you know the Box probably are hunted but because they're killing dough is at night there hunted most days out of the year so they are as well as wired as it can be I mean because they're used to being pursued yeah it's different than to say like whitetail deer like whitetail deer seem to kind of know when hunting season comes around down like when they're velvet drops off and the rubber valve it off and then the the female start coming into season that's when they get fucking sketchy and nervous cuz they know that guns are going to be going off, they just kind of chilling these things in the winter more focused on food and putting on some weight to to make it to the winter so other than hunting season they are more chill but these things I don't think they ever get a day off a day off cuz if if everybody said hey

<timemark seconds="881" />

 if they did they would all die either of starvation that or they would population the island because people brought goats and the goats literally had decimated the vegetation to the point where the island started going into a drought I don't understand this but somehow or another if you eat all of the vegetation the the rain stops falling in certain areas or the lack of participation or condensation doesn't gather because there's no no leaves to catch capture it or one of the ladies who lives there was explaining it to me why they had to kill all the goats how I said she was like trees were dying everything was dying and they're in the process right now of in Maui they have this gigantic area that they are trying to eradicate dear from and they want to fence it in to let the forest regrow because the forest doesn't have a chance to regrow with again same animal Axis deer cuz they just eat all the little baby trees as a little trees are coming up there just to those

<timemark seconds="944" />

 Microsoft and that's what they eat these shoots and they want the new Brown I mean as far as I know Ben was one of them but we had just an awesome group of hunters there are all our friends and some of the best Vault hunters in the world and it was a man it was a good time hearing the stories from everybody was John Dudley made an amazing meal cooked up some meat one night and it said you could access deer is so delicious it's incredible how it goes if my theory that the fastest things in the most delicious cuz they trying to get away cuz they know they taste good salmon how good is salmon do I give me the fuck out of here I don't like fish but don't like fish at all I like hell of it I like white white fish

<timemark seconds="999" />

 big wave surfer / awesome bow hunter my buddy Adam Greentree Sam Soha Ben O'Brien I don't know the last name Will from Yeti yeah I don't know either I don't know what a fucking crew yeah so awesome so much respect for guys like those guys were at the top of their game you know I mean I don't think people realize how hard it is so when I see these guys go out and are successful with basically sharp stick you know it's on its special an animal like that so a lot of these people it's new country like Adam hadn't been there I hadn't I'd never been there when she guys go out there and do that on a new hunt in new country for new animals it's it's impressive

<timemark seconds="1058" />

 Max and will be honest

<timemark seconds="1066" />

 you got a deer though I'd lie and Adam and Remy I mean fucking straight assassins and Shane I mean and he lives out there people don't know like you Shane is world renowned as a big wave surfer but he's an awesome bow hunter I mean he's a really excellent and does it all the time out their spot and stalk crawling around the bushes for all the mean you were there the last day when I shot my last year I crawled a quarter of a mile to get to these fuckers I was watching you guys from an elevated spot up on top of the hill and I was when you guys were up walking from a mile I could see you easy you know I'm going to put on dealers no problem and then all sudden you were gone and so I sent Alex a text to Mike why are you guys hiding from me cuz I would you like to have to really glass really got something to be like there's a head

<timemark seconds="1122" />

 how long

<timemark seconds="1129" />

 I would say an hour almost an hour an hour to get a quarter mile and it that is a lot of work I know you got to be so you had a bow in your head out didn't have anything but you're moving that bow with each yeah whatever you crawling step and in especially doing a plank for an hour I was I was winded by the time we got to where the deer now to take a deep breath take a deep breath so we got within 55 yards and I'm like we're good right here at this a good spot we're behind a bush but my shoulders are sore from doing push ups cuz like you're you're crawling like a cat so you're saying you're trying to be super quiet so I can do it people are listening you're crawling but you're not just kind of crawling along. Crawling as quietly as you can a deep respect for camouflage to like I was wearing a camouflage face mask in it

<timemark seconds="1190" />

 I had a camouflage backpack by the final day I had gloves on I was fucking fully camo we watch took the shoes off we're crawling a lot of it was in wool socks just so you could be even more quiet yeah yeah there's there's no you can't take to Greater measures on being more stealthy or quiet on these animals and immediately I put up a post and I saw one negative comment on my comment and I'm reading this shit it happened while I was there was my phone fucked up I dropped my phone on the first day and when I drop my phone the first day it just went haywire wouldn't work anymore and so I had to get a new phone so I ordered a new phone had it shipped to the island and when I was doing that I didn't use anything I didn't use any apps I didn't check my email I didn't check Twitter and I felt better I felt better he went cold turkey I went cold turkey for 3 days and why was out there going cold turkey I was like I feel better like this is better like check and all that

<timemark seconds="1250" />

 stuff all the time I do I need to know about the Mueller probe 24/7 if I was a super billionaire character I'd give Stormy Daniels money until please stop now but everybody I don't I don't want to hear it what do you want you want money you want money I'm not even saying that he's not guilty of the cheese you know she's in the wrong I think she is but what are you looking for let's can we get this out of the news but I don't need to hear the people since that time it was irritating you pay $135,000 I okay so you can just keep it on the DL right we're good hundred thirty-five you get the money now she's talking I don't think she has that money anymore I think she spent it

<timemark seconds="1302" />

 I don't know how to look at it cuz I want one hand I'm like well I think we should hold the president up to higher standards and you you shouldn't be able to just lie all the time be the president because how could we trust you if it comes to something serious like a war with China or something crazier invading Iran let's just go off the charger with everything if I can't trust you that you you don't want to tell everybody that you're banging a pornstar be great if you just had a press conference in Lay's gentleman who cares I enjoy sex and her sexual man before he was elected or whatever was the president economy is up down thank you goodnight support the troops you say you can't trust him

<timemark seconds="1370" />

 cuz if you lie about this stuff but okay so you say another present how do you know they're not lying I think you know I had a conversation with a friend of mine about Hillary Clinton and he's he's a big Hillary Clinton supporter to the point where it's like he like Jamie with the Cavaliers hat on he might as well have a Hillary Clinton hat on he's like Hillary Clinton's I'm sure they do I'm with her him and his wife are both like super Hillary supporters and I'm like it doesn't bother you at all that she deleted 30,000 emails it doesn't bother you at all right like they told her there's a probe we need to see all your emails just deleted them all that doesn't seem like maybe she's a liar and then when you hear call me account of what happened versus her account of what happened she's clearly not being honest that doesn't bother you and he's like why I think in comparison she doesn't lies much like what are you talking about like these are lies it doesn't matter in comparison right

<timemark seconds="1430" />

 my point is I think anybody who gets to that level of that business is slimy slimy maybe we would like you to not be a great mood like everybody I don't know I think the only way to get to the bottom of it is get him on the podcast I would love to get on the podcast that's getting drunk just so just so you know most people have podcast that aren't being Joe Rogan but that's almost true right now like most people do have podcasts that do they be like they got this get this dream guest list you know the wish list I'd love to have these people saying about you it's like it seems like I don't know I'm not you but like the Courtney dauwalter that people you're interested in

<timemark seconds="1490" />

 are more important to you than say like the air like a the president knighted states I mean what how do you do you have a wish list of guess I don't have a wish list now on the plane ride I don't I like talking to my friends and like talking to you I like talking to interesting people like the Sleep expert on the other day Matthew Walker like you didn't like me I didn't like that so I'm going to ignore that you said that that guy you Monday we have Michael Chandler and looking forward to that interesting people and they don't have to be famous to me at all right I'd like people that are interesting I mean this obviously pretty blankets day right but I'd like people that are doing things that are unique people that are that are

<timemark seconds="1550" />

 like Masters at a craft people that are working hard people that inspire me I like to be inspired you know I like I like talking to people who are curious and who study things you know whether it's Sean Carroll or Neil deGrasse Tyson or something people that understand things that I don't understand so I can pick their brain and ask him questions about stuff Trump how much did Noah trouble to be to me like a lot like sitting down with my friend Alex Jones like it's be like okay like I would be okay if you talk to him for three hours what kind of crazy stuff will come out and be awesome I really think that if he wasn't present I would like him I would really would like him I would say I would think he's a character if I didn't have business to do with him where was worried about like you know getting screwed over in some sort of a deal or something like that I would like him he's a wild man is character

<timemark seconds="1606" />

 where's a red bat baseball hat everywhere that says make America great again. That's awesome did you imagine that he is so divisive like he's so that people are so conflicted one side of the other against him that if you wear that hat they will kick you out of place again what world do we live in when you can't wear something that says make America great again yeah how how could that be considered anything but positive I don't write it but he's people hate him so much and that's so that's to me even a great accomplishment from what he's done is like he's got so much hate and you still look on the positive is it happen but most people don't take any positives to happen because most people live in my most people don't know I think there has been well I think most people live in an echo chamber and if you're like my friend who's a giant Hillary Clinton supporter

<timemark seconds="1664" />

 Trump's going to be kicked out of office in the first 60 days and it's like trust me it's not going to last year Mercury Doberman retired that show he's like yeah I don't need to do this anymore it's just a matter of days ago I don't know it was it wasn't soon enough I think you just had to fuking take a break I think he was losing his marbles nut that but they're so interested in the negative narrative that they're not they won't even promote anything positive so it's like when he was saying all the Rocket Man stuffs like it's going to cause a nuclear war okay now he's talking and now they're in negotiations North Korea in South north and south or are talking and he's like Trump had nothing to do with it it's like how could he almost our nuclear war and then have nothing to do with what's going on it's like it can't be both

<timemark seconds="1729" />

 she probably could if they would like listen let's not start Nuka world how about you and I talk like North and South Korea he deserves credit for that son some respect he's very easy very interesting guy in the fact that his methods are so outrageous in outside the norm I don't think he's world leaders know what the fuck to do with them and then hit my button is bigger than yours t-shirt and but that's what he's always done that so it's he's consistent we just expected to do something different because he's right you know mother son playing to that you're working with what is your your position in the administration cuz you actually have a wildlife conservation position now in the government right

<timemark seconds="1789" />

 what can happen now I didn't know how the hell did this even come up I don't know I'm on the international Wildlife Conservation Council hell of I got a the business not on business card but if I did I should I think about the belt buckle so I did I was like I was like you said you said you wanted a belt buckle maybe I'll give him my belt buckle that I wore on the hunt but then I'm thinking so I gave you the belt back over there to my shit maybe he wants a new belt buckle in the box with his sweet custom Bop no no no I don't want to be disrespectful and try to say here's a used belt make sure you were good at that cuz I wasn't I just I want you to want to get what you want basically so international law of conservation Council so I don't know how it started cuz I am like

<timemark seconds="1846" />

 man there is some powerful people on their Safari Club International people super successful business people and political campaign contributors and then you know we go to this meeting there 16 of us on the council and I'm like but not to my face but maybe later is fucking Oregon hillbilly yeah I don't know I don't know why I'm on there I don't who contacted you

<timemark seconds="1887" />

 I said are the Interior Department so running up Mount Pisgah Washington DC I swear to God I don't like I know it must be good cuz it was after okay so Trump put out the tweet and he said something like he doesn't see how Hunting For Elephants is conservation or helps Wildlife it's a it's a horror show doesn't yell Elephants or any other animal something like that and I was like what in the hell is that what are we talking about elephants elephants that's fine whatever but he said or any other animal so I took that tweet I posted it and addressed it in and I don't know if he saw it I don't know we know but soon after that I got a call for this thing and so

<timemark seconds="1941" />

 because I was you know I know just from Hampton Africa and how it works and the hunting is necessary over there if the animals are going to survive if it's complicated complicated situation but people people don't want to hear that now and so here's an example I'm trying to think how big was aiight I can't put the the number on how big was but they've been in business for 40 years so I'm hunting concession is is they have no hunters from usually America go over there they pay for that for the access to the land and they pay for the right to hunting animals so this place it's been in business for 40 years they went out of business because of this import ban Obama put an import ban on the ivory of elephants coming back as trophies but also been lice

<timemark seconds="1999" />

 after Cecil the lion and it was done as a political measure right so he put a ban on you can go over there and I'm still could you know we're from America we can't say what's legal in Africa but he can say what he did was say we can hunt them whatever cuz I can't control that but you can't bring him home so nobody's going to go and spend $75,000 kill an elephant or 50000 to kill a lion if they can't bring it home right so that basically shut down hunting and this outfit in Tanzania that a business business for 40 years they close they went out of business about

<timemark seconds="2038" />

 I think about 2 months ago now and what happens is when they don't have the the concession they can't pay for that land is given back to the people and for t r w i o that's great you gave the land back to the people it's not good to use on back to the people there cuz people can't do anything or have any money that they don't just like so what happened to the posters as soon as the hunting conception movies out poachers move in and kill every animal the only reason the animals that were being protected in the hunting concession was because there was nothing in there these this outfit would spin thinking the last three years they spent over 2 million dollars on anti-poaching efforts so $2000000 to protect bass guitar investment which is those animals that were in there yeah they kill a couple because cuz elephants are hunted and they ran the house and and probably lion but by and large they're protecting

<timemark seconds="2096" />

 the majority the herd well give me the numbers on elephants legally and illegally killed and this email Peter was there and all these animal rights activist I don't want a psycho so that could be disrespectful but anyway these extremist were there and so it was kind of heated and some point some cases but I did ask this question how many elephants are killed legally in Africa each year and the number is about 400 400 to kill legally entire continent which is the area of America United States of America you can also get all the European countries you could fit a lot of shit in Africa Africa's huge yeah and so there's some there's some areas where you're not going to hunt elephants because there's not litter there's not enough or they don't live there but there's some areas where there's too many elephants are so yeah that's what's confusing

<timemark seconds="2156" />

 people here elephants are going extinct well yeah they are in some places in other places but the problem is with local farmers they have these plots of land and the elephants come in and eat everything and destroy their land how big is an elephant how many thousands of pounds 10000 pounds is how much they're like the elephant is ruining my crop yeah that's what I need to eat I'm starving there's a food chain going on there and humans here where we are we're so far above the food chain they were like sitting a platform looking down watching it there they're embedded it the ground it's it's the whole it's a whole analogy of you can't have first world people solving third world problems

<timemark seconds="2212" />

 just like you have everything you want you have that you live in excess your fat you have you throw food away what are you talking about you have no idea what it's like in Africa so they're 400 elephants are killed legally 30,000 or post year 30000 and the reason that's happening is because the hunting had to move out the hunting clothes down or hunting is what pays for the anti-poaching efforts but when hunting money isn't there the poachers run rampant 30,000 elephants that's why they are devastated is such a not hunting it's such a hard thing for people swallow because what I thought this is from the point of view of someone who loves Wildlife I think this is what people want what they want is the humans to leave the animals alone and the animals to live in this state of bliss where they exist perfectly and the balance of nature a predator and prey all plays out in a natural way without people going over there and shooting elephants then stick in there

 tasks on their wall pictures these giant fat Fox holding a rifle standing over a lion you like this just looks wrong it looks like makes its way over to Africa and some guy shoots a line with a rifle now he's standing on its head and he's going to put it on his wall and a fat fucking house somewhere that bothers people I get it I get it too I mean I'm not arguing that but you got to fix Africa first yeah so this idea that if you just leave all those animals alone and stop hunting them everything's going to be fine no they going to be wiped out you got two people have to look at it pragmatically first and then idealistically does pragmatically you have to understand that these animals 20 years ago we're on the verge of Extinction so many different Antelope so many different what would called game animals animals that people eat we're on the verge of Extinction until they started instituting these big hunting concessions and

<timemark seconds="2336" />

 having people come in from Europe and America and hunting in Africa then the community starting to prosper because of someone's paying you know I don't know how much is it to shoot like a nilgai or something like that maybe 1500 so how many of those things get shot and some of that money goes to the ranch some of that money goes to the professional hunting guys anti-poaching conservation efforts and then you have unprecedented numbers there's more of those animals today than there have been in decades and it's all because people put value on them it's all about the animals have to have value and people say no will to animal has value being alive it's like okay what does to you as it does to you if you have a picture of an a line is amazing okay I'm at animal is beautiful there's value in a being alive

<timemark seconds="2388" />

 but they got understand those people need to eat they need to work so if they're not worth working for the hunting concession at the Heineken session goes out of business like the largest one in Tanzania did after 40 years were they going to do they can't go get a job at the mail you know what I mean there's no it was nothing is not industry over there so what happens is they were some of those people and I don't know for a fact but I would I'm going to make an educated guess if they would go from working as anti-poaching officers or are helping keep animals why of his as part of the anti-poaching program straight to poaching back and forth both ways right former poachers became anti-poaching officers when the opportunity but it's just like

<timemark seconds="2437" />

 it's sad because that you know that last 2 months without that hunting in section there without the anti-poaching program in place I guarantee it's going to slaughter the animals that were being protected are now just being slaughtered by poachers and again the difference between idealistic people in Africa to have plenty of food and plenty of opportunity for employment and playing things to do with their life but they don't you know and the situation that had emerged with these hunting concessions is superior to the situation that's in place now and it's also Superior for the animals and cells including the lions in Zimbabwe they had to kill look look this up Jamie see if you can because they had to call I think it was something along the lines of 200 Lions recently because they decimated Angela population because they weren't kept in check because

<timemark seconds="2497" />

 the way these the balance of nature works out as you have to have a balance between predator and prey have the only way to keep the balance of predators humans that's it don't even exist in Zimbabwe Wildlife Reserve will call 200 lines to control a population explosion claiming Hunters have been scared off by the outcry overseas align the whole thing is so weird because people just jump on it you know that you watch The Lion King Simba and I'll see and all this craziness there was this discussion about Cecil's brother that Cecil's brother got her heel Jericho oh my God they killed Jericho and then people were relieved cuz they found it was a different line and it wasn't Cecil's brother Jericho

<timemark seconds="2549" />

 lying is crazy it's not Jericho it's it's it's Michael the line so it's okay that's crazy but this shows you this first world view of this wild life situation that is not ideal by any stretch of the imagination I think part of it like with that the whole Cecil I think they gave people purpose it's like I'll have something to stand for I got I have a purpose now and that's where I know people are struggling out there finding what's my purpose what am I doing you know and they're spinning their wheels they don't I don't know what they do but that gave him something to fight for and it wasn't right it didn't help anything it hurt those 200 Lions could have been $50,000 each to a hunter 10 million dollars into it went to Zimbabwe stay there or or at least employed people but no they were killed there's no game it still sucks all across the board

<timemark seconds="2618" />

 the whole situation sucks these weird a high fence operations where they let lines loose and then they let him out of the cage and then people show up that day and lines on it what the fuck's going on and they shoot this line and then stand up that sucks two things weird look wildlife and Wildlife it's not ideal by any stretch of the imagination and these animals that were going extinct and now aren't because people were hunting them it's fucking strange that's a strange balance like that the only reason exist so people can come over there and shoot like we don't I don't I don't want that I mean I would like them to just exist well the thing yeah but people aren't going to contribute that money to pay for the anti-poaching just to go take a picture you just happen if you go to the Missouri breaks or something like that you go hunting mule deer that's what I like I like animals that exist because they did their there this is their spot

<timemark seconds="2678" />

 this is where they are like if you go to the Missouri breaks and you go up into those those Hills and and look for for mule deer those fuckers have been there for thousands of years mean they have found skulls of deer of whitetail deer in Florida that are 2 million years old the exact same animal 2 million years ago so for millions of years old in there have been human beings those things have been in that form running around North America or whatever the fuck they can that's what I like I like that too but don't forget that hunting has played a part in keeping those numbers healthy beer in the out there's more deer at the game animal North animals in North America now than there were a hundred years ago and that's through hunting and conservation that is true but it's also because a hundred fifty years ago people one fucking ham yeah I wiped out most of them drives well real bad when they would leave Mark hunting before

<timemark seconds="2738" />

 exactly what we've learned from that we learn okay this is how this is how we need to do it this out hunting fits in this equation and that's where you know we talked about the Inter National Wildlife Conservation Council that's giving me a way in to talk about a bunch of other things too so one of those and we talked about animals North America is Ryan zinke who's the Secretary of interior created this new I guess it's a bill I'm not like just put a goal expert I'm about Hunter right I wear a flannel shirt and baseball hat but he did create this I'm going to call it a bill but that protects the the winter

<timemark seconds="2779" />

 that we call and Wildlife Corridor so it's where the animals can go from the summer summer range to Winter range where there's not going to be development there so he created that because that's how those animals like in Montana make it to the winter if they're up in the summer they make it through getting in fall and then I'll send winter hits they have to have a way down into the Lowcountry it to where they can their winter migration to where they can survive the snow and in where they can make down and there's good feed down there if there's gas rigs or mineral mineral extraction efforts going on at MP that then they might get hung up up there and get stuck in the snow and died so he realizes that he realized the need for that he created this this new program that's going to make sure that there's no development in there keep says core doors open and that's that's why are numbers do so well is because of people like that with the vision on keeping her animals healthy

<timemark seconds="2839" />

 about on the flight that I think is important to bring up there was just talk about the State Monument or the National Monument Utah and a Patagonia put that thing on their page the president stole your land. Explain what actually happened because it's not what everybody thinks it is an intron Ella said it best if you say the president stole your land you're not being accurate with your words that's not what happened it was a Patagonia did an awesome marketing job I mean in that there is efforts by saying the prison sold your land from what I've heard that resulted in a 15% increase in business for them so it worked great but with the truth is is a lot of people felt like Obama when he before he left office did an ovary John the National Monument protection so there's protecting the National monument and then

<timemark seconds="2894" />

 which is a certain area he protected he wanted it and Compass 2 million acres in that National Monument designation which seems excessive was think he says the sector of interior he went in there and he said that's an excessive that's an over reach I want to scale it back to what it was before Obama did that is it excessive is never excessive right what he wants to do is make sure people have access and what and it's like okay under Obama in the way it is under sink E-Z G scale back to what it was before which that would be still National Forest still federal land but you'd be able to and I'm not sure if it was if it was Wilderness or how to access would be with but would think he would say is that like I would be able to go into the land all the time that 2 million Acres because I might be considered by some to be elite you know because I can walk

<timemark seconds="2955" />

 20 miles not everybody in the United States can walk 20 miles to get somewhere already so but if it was a National Monument right then no Road systems like what is the difference that I think the road systems would be gated off and it be walking walking on the track traffic only instead of access to the roads make it 2 million acres and close out the road so I'm not sure what so it's still Federal and no mining permits have been issued now no plans to drill or anything like that now what I thought when I looked at up because I was unsure about and I talked was thinking about it just because it's you know I'm learning all this as we go also and I was concerned when when I read the presents told you man I'm like what's this about

<timemark seconds="3009" />

 and so what what it is is what he what Zekey wants to do is he wants to just make sure people of not all abilities cuz it's not like we want roads on Every Mountain but have access to to National Forest so people that can drive in four by fours you know what those little on road on existing rugs and it just like National Forest now never enforced now has roads right right designated Wilderness areas because then I talked about that too I'm like wow okay I understand I understand access I said that's great I want people to be able to enjoy the great outdoors also but I also grew up hunting Eagle Cap wilderness

<timemark seconds="3052" />

 which is Oregon's largest Wilderness Area 3 and 56000 Acres of no roads and I don't want Rosen there I don't want access in the middle of the heart of that Wilderness because of some of the most pristine beautiful country in the lower 48 I like it like that so

<timemark seconds="3069" />

 we still need to go protect those areas but this wasn't and this one this is Bears ears and and Utah this wasn't changing anything open if anything or or this big nefarious plan of of Mining and stripping everything out of his right right they went back to what it was before and at that time when I research that there had been no mining permits that from what I understand is there is no there's not there's minerals in there but not enough to Warrant going in there and setting up a full mineral extraction mine and building roads that they change the distinction is to allow people to have more access to that Wilderness through road that already exists Wendy Wilderness Sabine National Forest okay Federal and yeah so then meditation is it a lack of understanding about what the difference in the distinctions of the two things are just creating negative narrative this is saying it's something cheap

<timemark seconds="3130" />

 Obama had it this way Zeki scaled it back that right there is like why what's going on not really doing the research about. He's not he's just putting it back the way it was because he thought that it was a overage by Obama so it's just you don't do these outfits during business

<timemark seconds="3150" />

 yeah if everything's going good there's really no reason for people to get fired up and distribute money you know some of these some of these its political in some respects business is political cynical. I see what you're saying but I think they will really what's going on is people are very concerned and they see any movement chain CERN but like patagonia's businesses about the outdoors at their whole business so they see anything that's a change in the Trump Administration especially in the beginning when it came in people were really worried about them and in terms of environmental concerns because it opened up offshore drilling they've done a lot of things that people really freaked out about that opened up what was the area Jamie in Alaska where they were going to open up drilling that was near salmon runs that people are very very concerned about think there will concerned about the idea of money above nature like and then me too

<timemark seconds="3210" />

 money I'm not making any of that money so someone else is going to make money off of what supposed to be our land and our public land which you and I could maybe go even though you don't like salmon we can go salmon fishing in this fucked-up by someone else making billions of dollars in oil or natural gas whatever that we do they contaminate that I don't want that no I don't want I don't want that either end it now from Patagonia don't want that either so when they see something like this come up there red flags go up they want to give people outraged you want to get people activated because they think that they might be a chance that if you protest enough you can stop something like this happening before does friend because if you do look at like what happened to Alaska with that big oil spill in the 80s or what happened with the BP oil spill in the Gulf Coast that shit's devastating once I feel like that does happen someone else is profiting making fucking billions of dollars while our our planet that we all share is getting fucked up you're not making a nickel off it I'm not making a nickel

<timemark seconds="3272" />

 top of it and they're making billions of dogs and their fucking up the land and by the government by Trump or anybody else where was opening it up giving them access to drill you open up the possibility of ruining something that's amazing well so there's always going to be a balance though there's you can't just say k nobody can drive past this point forever you know what I mean there's always so you're saying that about the Eagle Cap Wilderness you don't want them I drive back that would be area there's got to be there as we have to protect Wilderness areas but for example where we've elk hunting in Colorado right Big Balls awesome elk hunting there's natural gas Wells all over right it's great elk hunting yeah they've got wiped out and it in a huge mineral extraction mine that were there used to be beautiful whatever I don't want that but

<timemark seconds="3328" />

 doesn't work well they're just like where we find a Colorado to check the average person has me included is that someone is going to profit and by doing that we're worse I going to benefit you or anybody we know it's going to fuck it up for everybody else yeah that's the real concern out for sure I know that's why I've tried to you know that's what I've wanted to be involved like I'm on that Council which has nothing to do with public lands in North America but it's giving me a way to get in there and try to learn more that's all I'm trying to do you also were involved with it when Jason Chaffetz had that proposal in Utah to sell off of public land you were one of the people that sat down with him and got his take on it and ultimately because the outcry from people who love the outdoors and fisherman that was stopped what it was

<timemark seconds="3386" />

 you know he's out of politics now on Fox News talk to him that was HR 622 and that was they wanted to sell just what they determine disposable public land and I'm like okay wait a second who says what's disposable cuz what's disposable to you might not be to me maybe it's a great hunting area so I don't really like there wasn't really a way to determine what was disposable that that's what caught my attention and other not just mine but even people like Steve rinella and a lot of people in a loop and in-the-know and I got advice from let's see Randy Newberg Steve rinella Joe Webster at the theater Roosevelt concert conservation program all those guys are really experts in the field Backcountry Hunters & Anglers

<timemark seconds="3450" />

 Super Active getting people to complain and protest us it's about one I did get a chance to go back there and I did a podcast with the Chaifetz and yeah he pulled it it was gone never happen but yes that's what I mean we just need to be educated on it and I just don't like the I don't know without that education jumping jumping on the bandwagon saying yeah the president stole my land as what is that even true you know I always defer to rinella when it comes to things like this because he's so well-versed in it so and he said that you're not being accurate with the word I got to look into a deeper but I don't really understand it until I was talking to you and you were explaining me the distinction between how it was before Obama was in office about Obama changed and then bring it back to how it was before so it's still Federal and I don't sold it off it's just giving him more access to Rosebud amazing how when something like that happens this is Chuck can take out cry and everybody freaks

<timemark seconds="3512" />

 it's a it's confusing it can be confusing cuz I'll read two different things and I'll be like what is it this or is that that I don't know so that's where I think he would he was lying to your face I might I don't know maybe but on video. Doubt it I don't he doesn't seem like that guy he seems like he's a straight you know I asked him about he was getting beat up because the national parks Advisory Board wouldn't he wouldn't be with them that's what it was and so he got said you know Zeke he doesn't care about national parks and he won't meet with the Advisory Board and and so I asked him about that because that was in the news and that was just like many maybe he doesn't care about public land you know I mean I didn't know what was going on so I wanted to ask him about that I'm like well they resigned in protest because you wouldn't be with him what was that and he goes well yeah you're right I wouldn't be with them he goes here's how it went

<timemark seconds="3570" />

 I'm in a secretary of interior and in charge of I don't know how many different council is just like the international one I'm on in this park Advisory board that what we're talking about and I think 200 and some that he's he really I think he over I don't even stop thousands of employees billions of dollars and all he asked was for these advisory boards he wanted a report written up that said what have you done in the last 2 years what are you working on now and what your goals for the next two years once you provide me with that report then I'll get up to speed on me with you they never did it

<timemark seconds="3607" />

 so you met with them now is it that's what the story was he he wouldn't be with them and they resigned in protest but the other half of the story was he asked him to do something so he could get up to speed and educated on what's going on and he never supplied it if they are the typical government employees and what is the typical Governor employee incompetent lazy I entitled bureaucrats I've got this job in like all said he's asking them to provide not not just tell them what they've done but tell them what they're going to do and provide like a framework for the future that make that's a lot of work on some of the lazy fuck your job

<timemark seconds="3664" />

 so they might have resented him for whatever their preconceived notions of who he is coming out of this job and they were I don't know if all 12 of them I think they're 12 but I think they were all Democrat so I mean obviously he's a Republican and he's he's pissed cancel it's like you don't do this for money you do it to make a difference yeah but if they're going to be a volunteer or unpaid volunteering if he asks you to have a plan you should probably have a plan otherwise you there's someone out there that would have a plan yeah especially when it comes to something that's important as national parks and public land things that like really dear an important people is this is something that you know what you want to have whoever these volunteers are if you're going to point them he one of the best ones for the job right so it's asking someone to write a plan up and that's if that's the only

<timemark seconds="3728" />

 she stopped because we don't have their take on it I read what they wrote and what did they write it said that he would meet with them and

<timemark seconds="3736" />

 whatever so they would meet with them until they did what he asked they didn't say that he told me that that's what he said right yeah that makes sense yeah I mean I'm kind of in his Camp that's it if we're looking at it a hundred percent accurately and he told me face to face that's what happened so I mean you know you can say well I don't believe anybody I don't believe you I don't believe what you just told me I don't believe at some point you have to be like man seem like he's telling me the truth and I believe it and not make sense yeah it does make sense that they would not want to do that you know yeah what have you been working out well I'll check my email and going for work yeah so I mean he seems like hardworking pretty demanding but he cares I mean he's in there trying to sew the Secretary of interior before the same key I had not I don't know what that is that's what that's what

<timemark seconds="3797" />

 involvement that person had in Hunter in the lives of hunting people like me or fisherman and so when I didn't know who it wasn't come to find out her name was Sally Jewell who is Obama's appointee before Trump appointed zinke so I like the fact that I think he's at Shot Show he's had me out there I'm on this council is at least I have a seat at the table to say and I don't know I might get kicked off the account so I might never get invited back because I'll ask him so what's going on with this but right now I have a seat at the table so whatever it's it's I consider that a win at least I can try to find out and going to learn yeah it's it's it's an interesting thing because everything that I've heard about him that have red in the media unless I'm reading like a hunting website or something like that. Everything I've heard is like that it's a horror show that he's bringing on all these Trophy Hunters and there was an article equating you would being a trophy

<timemark seconds="3857" />

 and that this Council that he's put together it's just a disgusting sort of justification for trophy hunting and that they're only putting it together so that wealthy people can bring back there elephants at the shooting Africa yeah I've read that too I mean for me and I'm not I've never kill an elephant I've never killed a lion in every purse it's so even the people on the council that have they do care about animals they care they're volunteers just like on the parks Advisory Board and they want to make a positive difference you know I know every person on that I don't know every person personally but I know they care about the people of Africa and that's why they understand how it works they've been there they've seen it

<timemark seconds="3901" />

 the guys who I've hunted with their personally

<timemark seconds="3905" />

 awesome people hard-working people I'm the one guy on my last trip there to Tanzania in his daughter was in college and he'd been a professional Hunter over there for over 20 or 30 years and she was going to college now getting her degree I mean professional Hunter over there over here there's no Hunters Guide mph is our professional Hunters so I mean because of hunting he's able to send his his daughter to college and I mean and now that's gone yeah I mean I'm not saying every person a lot of a lot of them and they're not getting any better because right now so that policy Trump said well we're going to review it on a case-by-case basis so he didn't say he didn't say okay it's legal now everybody can hunt and and go and bring the truck is back he said we'll review each one case-by-case basis so that

<timemark seconds="3965" />

 still doesn't make it that good for Hunter because they say well I'm not going to book a hunt if I don't know for a fact I can bring my trophy back yeah so it's not really that much better with new just saying that freaks people out like trophy like you sent trophy it's an animal is an animal's life you going to bring it back. Just that distinction is one of the things that triggers people trophy so I mean I see hairs on your wall right here that's a trophy but also you ate the meat of that elk so I mean it it's not like you can't be both A Trophy Hunter and hunt for me there's people are not blank bringing back line me no they're not but it's also not mutually exclusive to be a Trophy Hunter and eat the meat or on the elephant's those know that mean is going to waste on an elephant's true that's why I was gonna stand there elephants actually they actually taste good there was a documentary just yeah I haven't had elephant I mean I had

<timemark seconds="4026" />

 I've had crocodile and I've haven't had lion over there but that meat is mean the villagers that live there man it's they think they need it and there was a documentary on CNN recently called Trophy and I remember if there's a scene in there for the hunter shot an elephant and it wasn't a big one and the people were making fun of him for shooting their likes he's the small they wanted a big elephant with lots of meat you know okay so he he got his quote trophy they wanted more meat so it's like you can have both and that that's all say trophy hunting because guys are going over there for the meat I get it I mean that's not why you go to Africa you're going for the trophy but also that the meat isn't going to the meet is going to the villagers is not going to let it rot and these people I've seen it I've seen videos of it it's crazy they show up with baskets on their head filled with elephant meat in a carrying around

<timemark seconds="4086" />

 150 lb of meat on their hat yeah I mean it's really not so we can watch these people just run in and get chunks of this elephant and they need it it's it's really important protein for them the solution is very very complicated Africa is such an enormous place in the poverty is so intense and the options are so limited down for these people there is this is not like a simple like band the trophy hunting in the animals will live peacefully in the forests to tweet tweet bird bird that's not what's going to happen dies yeah it's not just that everything over there is really complicated and I always tell people to watch the lowest through documentary he did a thing on this hunting thing an African he was over there for a long time and when he was over there you got a sense cuz he's Louie through is really fascinating British documentary guy he's really polite and you like kind of pasta

<timemark seconds="4146" />

 stop over and over and over again to the heart of the matter but at the end of the documentary you realize like this is complex this is not as simple as hey these mean people want to go over there and kill animals and treat them as objects the whole place is kind of it it's very very confused like it's a it's a mess there's a there's a video

<timemark seconds="4168" />

 right now at Jamie could probably find it but so there's I think there's three hunters in there over there I can't remember if there they have bows and arrows or spears but what they do this lion kills an animal for them to get meat they run in there a Chase off the line and Chase off The Lion and steal the meat off the account remember what it was cut the legs off of it and get out of there before the Lions cuz Lions if you run out of lion sometimes I'll be like Lowe's that's weird and I'll back off and then before they figured out they'll be like wait a second I can kill you then but in that in that hesitation time they try to cut off that we can get out of there so you know when you're here in America making decisions for people like that like I got a problem with that what you said makes a lot of sense that it's a first world perspective on a third world problem where people are literally

<timemark seconds="4229" />

 starving to death they're trying to figure out how to get any survive they need protein that protein is like gold back there

<timemark seconds="4237" />

 yeah it's um yeah this is at this is the video in the sun Discovery Channel we can't show it but we're running in

<timemark seconds="4245" />

 yeah it's pretty intense so lying the lines basically covered with blood

<timemark seconds="4255" />

 it's crazy I mean the Lions just don't know what to do they see these people walking out them with look like weapons and they just take a chance and bought but what a fucking chance that is those are bows and arrows looks like

<timemark seconds="4271" />

 osteophyte stealing meat from Lions check it out to get an idea of how rough it is and just know that the measures I'll take to get some protein yeah I mean that whole thing just created this uproar if you steal the kill and nobody is hurt

<timemark seconds="4305" />

 that's when you can relax Jesus Christ yeah they're happy he goes with its hind quarter slung over his shoulders are vilified by a large majority of the population here where we said before 90s 96% of America eats meat and Hunters are the ones out there getting themselves and like I remember that last Buckeye killed and when I took care I was like meticulous on taking care of that me and as I I got it the animal as I took the bladder out what happened but I'd like a drop of urine dropped on a tiny little piece of the back camera I was just like what I was not happy and because not me is to me is Everything is Everything for the hunt and I was so disappointed in myself but I mean obviously the meat still good but that I I want to be perfect when I'm when I'm taking care of it

<timemark seconds="4366" />

 meanwhile there's people that eat 96% of people eat meat and we throw away was Ben was Ben figured 40% of our food goes in the food places in saying this country and I think Anthony Bourdain just did a documentary on it right I don't think it's out yet but he did a documentary on food waste so I'm worried about one little tiny piece of me on animal I killed and people who throw away 40% of of what they buy into the garbage they're judging me the negative you know that's one thing like like I said about to put up my post about Lanai I just saw a couple negative comments and like I'm not even reading this stuff like Coke have at it folks wait just walk away how did you how did you know what they said if you didn't read them because I put it up and I saw it immediately afterwards like a half a second of it is that people

<timemark seconds="4426" />

 will be negative cuz it's easy to do cuz they're douchebags they don't even look then I even thinking it through it's like you're just like 200 animals people like to just make a statement or get a reaction or push a button or fuck with you yeah they want they want a reaction that's how it is in 1/4 you can block the comments yeah yeah all those things are kind of fucked just sucks it's I've I've got I've been pretty frustrated whatever I'm not I don't read them cuz obviously I read them but I get frustrated

<timemark seconds="4466" />

 man it's just hunting people just don't understand hunting because he would hunters will say I'll say I don't enjoy the kill and I don't enjoy the kill I enjoy getting me that I can feed my family myself enjoy the kill in that it's not like this is awesome but it is like huh it's a relief it feels good that your hard work paid off it feels good that all the ethical consideration that you put into making a perfect shot is all worked out in the amount of work that's involved in making you know 70 yard shot 70 yards is a long fucking way to hit an animal perfectly that comes out of his a good feeling but it's not like it's that shoot A3 pointer at the buzzer win the Championships and everybody's jumping up in the air it's not it's not fun people say well hunting is killing us fun

<timemark seconds="4527" />

 it's like no it's not fun is that for me it's not fun at all I killed two bucks made to perfect shots they went not far over down and seconds and that was a huge relief to me that's why I do what I do every single day and like I said I posted on it to be merciful and I don't enjoy when I'm not as perfect as I want to be and I killed a bowl last year in Colorado

<timemark seconds="4554" />

 house of Johnny Hamilton when she know Johnny and he was back cal-con hear this book comes up the hill he shops at 15 yards and I hit him perfect right behind the shoulder it perfect he ran down stopped at 30 hesitated again I already had another airline boom hit him right beside the first first hole and I'm like that bull I was so convinced he was down and I was just like home and that's that's all good got to win them perfect through the lungs he's going to be done in seconds he wasn't done in seconds and I have no I don't know what happened it was it was testosterone cuz he's coming off the hill he's bugle and he was super fired up so I don't know what was going on but ended up it wasn't as quick as you kill is what I have in my mind what to prepare for what I'm happy accepting and that and Johnny knows I wasn't happy I was just like I was so disillusioned

<timemark seconds="4615" />

 I don't know maybe

<timemark seconds="4619" />

 maybe 20 minutes 20 minutes something like that wow that's crazy yeah you as a possible I don't know I have no idea that's incredible it really bothering me it it it it upset me I wasn't I was disappointed with myself I was disappointed you could have done better I don't know I don't think she made a perfect shot I felt like it was perfect but you know if it's perfect animals dead in in 10 seconds so I don't know but when I watched it I killed a lot of bowls I want to the process a lot I would take those two shots on any animal any time and fill a hundred percent confident he was going to go 50 yard and about when we filmed at Under Armour hunt in Utah this is no

<timemark seconds="4677" />

 it's a big deal I want to make sure that this thing is that it's a perfect hit you know and so the feeling of relief that I got when I saw that it was a perfect pass through and the arrow he was bleeding on both sides on very unsteady legs walked about 20 30 hours and then tipped over that's an amazing feeling of relief but it doesn't feel good but doesn't feel good I like yet no it's not fun now there's a feeling of like accomplishment but also have remorse tied in together hits

<timemark seconds="4719" />

 and for the animal like with a bow with a perfect shot that you know on on these box that I killed they didn't know I was there so it was just I know they didn't feel it wasn't like there's a rifle report and Bone shattering and they're dying from trauma they're dying from him is like you're both at in Utah that took off his legs are wobbly because of blood pressure get a blood pressure loss because of hemorrhage that's not painful you know that's a bats that was a perfect scenario that's what we prepare for and that's that's our goal and when it doesn't work like that that bothers me and so when people chime in on your page or or on my page and he's uneducated comments trying to trying to tell me how I feel or why I do what I do man that does not make me happy no but I understand it's the ability to comment on things is a very strange thing because the ability

<timemark seconds="4780" />

 talk to people is very difficult very difficult to have an audience to sit in front of someone that you know to pick a person a famous pug Morgan Freeman sit down across from epic Morgan Freeman was very hard trunk it's very hard to be in front of them to be able to sit down and talk to someone and to look them in the eyes you would choose your words properly and you'd have a conversation but if you just like what's on your face bro like you just what song has black spots on your face you dumb fuck yeah I put that on Twitter and it's easy it's easy and that's so it's a human being communicating with another human being and saying something insulting and it's so incredibly easy to do yeah it's too easy to understand

<timemark seconds="4823" />

 there's something about the fact that 90 I think it's 97% actually eat meet somewhere the range and maybe 3% do it themselves 3% like what is Nationwide if you to pick Nationwide like how many people Nationwide kill their own food is it even 5% okay well there's I know cuz I look this up cuz I was curious on how many people I'm reaching on Instagram so there's 13 million license Hunters

<timemark seconds="4858" />

 13 million how to know how many is in a 300 and some how many people are in America is it 3:20 somewhere in the range 320 million Yeah Yeah Sandlot

<timemark seconds="4873" />

 it's a very small amount and how many of them are only eating that how many of them are spending so much time hunting that they can live off of the meat that they kill themselves it's one maybe 1% I saw people like we had the picture of your freezer back here. With me and they're like you know saying you couldn't eat that bad I thought you know you're just killing what you need to eat but so that's just some people have a lot of my friend that was the key is I thought I was going to say is every guess that comes you ask if they want game me and they take me to fucking mooch he comes over here consolation or steak have you seen have you seen his body he's I thought he ate steaks like all day everyday

<timemark seconds="4934" />

 can you talk a lot of my friends and I love it where you going to get it l i see a lot of people send me messages said they want to know what this whole elk me things about so that they want to be involved they want to know where can I buy elk because I don't hunt or they want to start hunting but yeah what that's what we talked about when we loaded up my dear in your freezer to freeze it is that they don't Hunters are providers it's that's a big feels good to be able to give PA me that food to me it's it's everything it's either to feed my family or to give my friends or not my extended family. Harvested

<timemark seconds="4983" />

 that's to me that's as good as it gets yeah I had Michael hunter in the podcast recently is the chef that runs that restaurant and antler in Toronto and they're getting protest by vegans they gave him a bunch of meat is cooked it put up on Instagram how do you just like this so awesome send it made me feel so good like look at these delicious meals at this guy prepare his professional shaft with me from an animal that I killed I give away a lot of that me but I eat it everyday I eat almost everyday I eat some sort of game me if I'm home that's what I eat lunch in Lanai I know what are those sticks called

<timemark seconds="5025" />

 oh the Bob The Butcher makes because Max's Jack's pepperoni pepperoni out of Sensational Sensational he's a really good butcher to look what he's done with all the cuts and label them onto gives you an envelope that has all of the recipes of how you should cook each individual cut yeah it's awesome and it makes me feel like I never saw any of this when I was a kid I grew up in the city I never I used to fish like to eat fish that I caught but I never was involved in hunting at all and tells in my 40s so when I you know I see comments from people that probably grew up the way I grew up they don't get it they never never involved it but yet they're eating meat and it's just it's because no one's holding you accountable for what they're saying and it cuz it's easy to say you want to go to little see if so common so dumb

<timemark seconds="5084" />

 give a little give a little dick you just want to go out and kill this be a lot of death out there a lot of little dick maybe we should show him just to prove prove her wrong let's look at that bear attack the selfie very good forgot to do that while taking a selfie with It Go full screen in this please God has stupid fuck

<timemark seconds="5112" />

 so this bear apparently was injured and this dumbass in India decided he was going to go and take a selfie with it you stupid fuck

<timemark seconds="5124" />

 oh no it's got the guy that's why. The guy he's already fucking this guy up Jesus Christ

<timemark seconds="5137" />

 I'll see you look at that right there are you free bro you're free. That's the shitt way to go folks God Alex Terrible No One have a fucking gun does no one have a knife does no one have a baseball bat and going clock that fucking thing in the head nobody's doing anything it's over we've lost him at the bear

<timemark seconds="5180" />

 or that the bear

<timemark seconds="5183" />

 is that what it says why they would show it afterwards this is what it looks like it's just some stupid video Do Ya bad bad to take pictures of bears it's a real common thing y'all still never really sure what that other people there to get real close to barres take selfies with him I've done that before well I think it's different. You've done a y while bear hunting yeah but you've only done it with black bears yeah but you never turn your back on crazy like that I don't know no button black bear is still still not say and I can say is smart at all definitely not yeah but it's a you know you can read bears bears have personality your attitude just like dogs so it's coming in, not going to turn my back and yeah I have one dog that I will let my kids that Mike my Mastiff my kids could ride that dog they do anything that dog is a loving dog he loves everybody

<timemark seconds="5244" />

 you know and then I have another dog that's a Shiba Inu Bulldog I don't let anybody talk with him he's a littlest dog to he's an asshole like if you would like try to get him to get up and get out of house in the morning who growl at you like this motherfucker come on I'll go outside yeah man for 14 years get up he's just old and he's in pain a lot it's really hard for me to get up at the point is the other dog I'm sure he's old too but he just seems like a sweetheart he's got no aggression in him towards people just right dog that's just personalities Bears just like that the sun bears are cunts actually there's a petition out there about I don't know something about me but it says I took a selfie of a bear then killed it which is the bear took a selfie of I did not kill because it wasn't old enough so just have to spell any rumors those petitions are fascinating you know I mean

<timemark seconds="5303" />

 people don't want you to kill bears here's the thing people don't they won't don't want animals to die I don't want you to kill him was how do you feel about animals killing animals because if you don't want to. One of the best ways to stop at is to kill bears yeah but if you kill bears they get more angry at you for killing Bears Mount Lyons and Lyons than anything else maybe elephants which don't kill anything total herb they kill people galivants do occasionally people do something stupid like fuck with them something I will go out of their way to kill people think they do I doubt it I think they kill people if people just where they they want to go and like hey asshole that's killing on

<timemark seconds="5346" />

 how about you get away from the elephant but you know the problem with that is like if you growing crops like we're saying the elephant start eating your crops like get out of here and accuse me yeah rap kid know if it's going to be aggressive they can but they're also fucked with constantly and you know there's just something to me I like elephants yeah I think they look awesome they're cool I'm glad there are other real I know they're smart I know they have like tight Bonds in their community and you have to kill one of those to eat it I mean it's like there's plenty of other animals to eat this late I just bought call starving to death and I was living in a place that only had elephants for sure killing elephant yeah I mean if that was all I had to eat our friend Brian Steven said it tasted delicious he said he ate one in Africa he said it was like won the most delicious steaks you never had his life and I was like what like how is that possible

<timemark seconds="5400" />

 endangered elephants and tigers kill a human human a day in India is growing population squeezes habitat yeah but this is a crazy situation man India's fucking so overpopulated it is a very very small placed what is he doing trying to get over that fence since 2014 how many human deaths in 4 years lost Tigers of killed 92 people in the same. So elephants kill way more that's nuts

<timemark seconds="5434" />

 at the end of that bear selfie thing it said two other people were killed in that state in India and they're both trying to take selfies with elephants it's one of the kid there's too many people in India in India is grossly overpopulated India I think is smaller than the United States right isn't it like what size is India I don't know it's smaller than the contiguous United States but it has a billion people in it more than one third the size more than one-third okay a billion is a lot yeah that's a lot of fucking people saying triple we have in the third the size third larger oh that's what I heard are size I thought you were seeing a third larger I reread it and

<timemark seconds="5487" />

 Jesus Christ is killed that's crazy how do you fix a place you know yeah that's that's part of Africa is some places in Africa also they aren't I know that because malaria medicine is good people are dying from AIDS there's a lot of people that's how big is India compared to the USA look at this India fits right in there how big is Africa go to how big is Africa is Africa's hilariously that USA India China

<timemark seconds="5532" />

 Eastern Europe Germany France Spain Italy Switzerland Netherlands Belgium Portugal and Japan and Great Britain inside of Africa that is crazy that's crazy when you look at that on a map you feel like how the Congo is as wide as America is just a Congo

<timemark seconds="5567" />

 the true size of Africa man so when someone says like elephants are endangered in Africa in some spots sounds fun some spots they're over run that's just like Grizzlies are endangered in La there really in danger in La unless you go to the certain bars in Santa Monica Boulevard I didn't know that was a gay reference till recently not gay people I guess you got to read don't have to hang out take your pants down first if you want to get you a job hey speaking of I don't know what were speaking of but we need to talk about Kanye Jamie's got crazy Kanye conspiracy theories theories self first of all he was like he came out for Trump recently sort of

<timemark seconds="5629" />

 he also called Trump bald Thief all day Kanye is a lunatic so I could care less what people think that should come on it's not a it's a it's a pendant with a picture with his picture in it and Trump yeah she loves nuclear bombs and he loves physics class pierce ears here's what I like by Kanye is a lunatic but I do like Candace Owens who is also new on the scene in My Fox News world I love you

<timemark seconds="5688" />

 what in Candace's just like she I walked in from work the other day and I was like started listening to Fox News on of course I'm watching on my who the hell is this course he has foxy just Blair and propaganda for your house all the time to 2:30 p.m. to watch Infowars exclusive on Candice Candice and Kanye so I just going to let them in together you talking about that everyone thought they were going to be on the show together cuz I'd like what Candace says well Jamie thinks that all this wackiness with Candace Owens and Kanye is really Kanye just getting people hyped up about the release of his new album which be out of gas

<timemark seconds="5749" />

 yeah who's getting people fired up you think that's what's happening Jamie

<timemark seconds="5752" />

 yeah there's a internet conspiracy it's been like not proven cuz it can't be proven yet but there's a long Twitter thread in a few like reports and on blogs or magazines if you will that sort of lead so I can Andy Kaufman type performance art piece that he's doing the maybe I'll bring up a conversation about some of these topics is actually talking about or maybe we'll find out in the album comes out in Kanye is doing performance then what's the point here's the here's the problem is it's a certain amount of him that is undeniably insane and you seen that like that thing that Jimmy Kimmel mocked we had that little kid he used to do little kids saying things that Kanye said and like you would have like he would have little kids say they can a camel by the way you better be like them I like I would he say he cries about hunting

<timemark seconds="5805" />

 what are you crying about lions sea salt

<timemark seconds="5808" />

 yeah that's why I went really well I feel like a bitch sometimes I cried when Conor McGregor was talking about the support he gets from Ireland I had to hold back the tears did you being honest I was being honest he started talking about the love I get from these people from Ireland my car that must be amazing I get that that's different than Jimmy though trying to drum up stupid stuff for Cecil the lion the lion thing is weird weird you know there was a great article that was in the New York Times in Zimbabwe we don't cry four Lions bright happened right after that this guy was talking about his family members were killed by lions yeah we have a very idealistic view of what a lion is and I'm a big fan of lions I'd love that they're real I love that exist I love you see videos of them one of my favorite documentaries of all time is a document called Relentless enemies and is about these this one pack of lions that got

<timemark seconds="5878" />

 a river changed its path and they got stranded on island and is one pack of Eye of lions grew in normous because all they have to hunt is water buffalo so instead of his variety of different game animals all they have to hunt is huge 2000 pound so they grew jacked like Hulk size lines were the female lions or is big is a regular mail really it's all fucking amazing. Printing some images from it the way they look like they're so muscular they're fucking huge My 600-lb Life I fucking amazing but the documentary incredible because these water buffalo are so big and so hard to take out they need like six or seven of them just jump oh yeah but because of his I believe this is all

<timemark seconds="5938" />

 for the. I think it's a short amount of time they do circus yes and short amount of time that these Lions have lived on this one Island okay they did a whole documentary about hyenas cape buffalo and lion in a few birds and some other shit so there's nothing else for them to eat then I want to eat Hyenas hyenas steak taste like in Africa they say hyenas are witches witches it's like an alpha female has a dick remember that it's not cool no Jimmy Kimmel also made the small penis

<timemark seconds="5998" />

 about hunters what is this Delta Alliance from planet Earth II really talented picture Google enormous Lions Relentless enemies I know this video on it you can get this planet Earth 2 but the documentary is just really just Google Relentless enemies documentary

<timemark seconds="6028" />

 so this is this area where are the lines of stranded in this one particular it's not a very large spot but in this one place yeah there it is

<timemark seconds="6041" />

 it's really fucking awesome now get some good images of how big these things are can't wait till they just want to watch no dang go to the second one not that one but go back to the page that go to the second one Relentless enemies lions and buffalo up this is the one this is so this is the actual documentary and there's also a pride of lions at a regular size on this island to just really confusing to biologists tell him what the fuck

<timemark seconds="6074" />

 can't really tell here

<timemark seconds="6077" />

 let's see how Jack these females are

<timemark seconds="6081" />

 yeah it's tough to tell here but here they are trying to take out the skate Buffalo Outlook this this is crazy they're all piling on it the females are much much larger than a regular female pretty brutal a man Evolution fast any shit watching things struggle to survive

<timemark seconds="6101" />

 turn out there for a Pimp death is never pretty know the thing is people would have a really hard time if a person was doing any of the things that line yeah me and you would think that would be awful but do you have a hard time with Lions doing the things that lines to say no because that's natural people do you realize the only reason why people even exist is because people did what lines do the difference is humans have compassion you know I mean animals there's no they don't have time for compassion out there you know I mean it's Justin. I put up this video on my Instagram this Zebrahead just zero full had just been dropped it was just barely standing wobbly legs lion big male lion walks up to it kills it like it been alive minutes I saw that video that's life that bums me out but not as much as the one where you said you had was in a Moose Cafe

<timemark seconds="6163" />

 call Kalkaska screaming out its mother is just a few feet away trying to figure out what to do in the grizzly just tearing apart that sucked if you don't control the populations of Grizzlies that happens all the time and it even today right now with the gist of populations as they exist right now in places like Alberto the estimate that 50% of all moose elk and deer calves are killed or killed by bears they just a part of them and that's that's what happened at the British Columbia cuz they did that they didn't vote in Vancouver essentially to vote on whether Grizzly hunting should be allowed course people in the city in or just like here don't think there are hardly any bruises left so they said now until the new

<timemark seconds="6214" />

 but I can't remember what the political parties called but the one in control now said Grizzly hunting is no longer socially acceptable and so they can't hunt them and you'll see what's going to happen with the with the other animals they're going to hire people to hunt them what happens in those situations is what happens in California when it comes to mountain lions and they still get hunted but they get hunted a very hush-hush way assassin's to go out to these lines to kill dogs and cats and you know it scared the shit out of joggers and that's they're going to have to do two bears the problem with that hunt

<timemark seconds="6249" />

 though it was the way it was explained gritty bowmen did a podcast about it and what they were explaining was that was a very small percentage of people that even voted on this I mean it was like it's a few thousand people voted for the consequences that there needs to be a balance of these bears and these animals or otherwise the animals going to get dust made in the Bears getting crochet human populations and then on top of that these bears like that there's been this whole business of guiding and outfitting for these bears in the biologists are not talking to the people that are actually in the woods on the ground but that the population numbers if you talk to people like my friend Mike Hawk Ridge right who lives up there is I'll tell you there is a lot of bears there's a large population of grizzly bears and it's very difficult to determine what the actual population is if they're not listening to the people that are on the ground every day

<timemark seconds="6307" />

 boots on the ground when you have a vote on something like this no one's taking into consideration these things like you're just going there so why would you kill a bear they're amazing yeah you know I love bears the anthropomorphisation of animals is one of the more dangerous things that people have done with civilization what we've decided that animals are like us there are friends they have they wear baseball hats and fucking ties guy it's just weird and we do it from the time kids are little you know you give him a teddy bear and then you know you tell him all you don't kill real bears do you like going to kill you do understand what a bear is bear is that thing with that guy in India that's what they are it's a monster it's an awesome monster I'm glad they're real but their meat is delicious it is like people think that somehow or another you can't eat bears like people get mad at you for killing a bear but they won't get mad at you for killing a pig because

<timemark seconds="6370" />

 pigs are ugly like a wild pig like wild pigs with one of those one animals were vegans and animal rights activist don't have an answer to frame you know they really don't like seeing people shoot them out of helicopters they don't like seeing people hunting them but if you looked at the actual numbers I would love to sit down and have someone from pita or any animal rights activist group sit down with someone who really understands the wild pig infestation problem the invasive species that doesn't have a natural predator that breeds 3 to 4 times a year and can have as many as six to eight piglets in his litter and they're just just fucking like there's no tomorrow and they're having tons of them and they just destroy billions of dollars in crops every year what do you do about that we're going to do

<timemark seconds="6417" />

 tell me what to do animal right people tell her they don't think about it because this is not a balanced nuanced objective approach they haven't looked this whole thing with Dave decided is that killing a sentient beings is bad speciesism is bad you know that one species as I do yours a species species list everybody is when it comes to bugs

<timemark seconds="6441" />

 contract everybody is at Subway hey you want some bacon on that yeah Throw Some Bacon on there but if you don't that's if you eat at Subway bro everybody vegans at what 3% yeah what is it the number of vegans what's the percentage 3% will not not not Wesley Town know I know a lot of cool because you have me to Edward's out right about a cool beans but there's a lot of things that are just super self-righteous so he wants the ones there on that team is super self-righteous and ask him how much time they have in the woods not much how much time you have a lot of time in the woods form that opinion

<timemark seconds="6495" />

 killing a calf elk when I put that up I don't even like to watch it I'm a Hunter I've killed a lot of animals I don't like to watch it but we have to show it how do you think they feel about animals killing animals do you think they feel it's okay because it's natural

<timemark seconds="6521" />

 I don't know what they think but wonder if it's just a convenient thing that they just look past la la la la la la I think that's probably what it is like what is more beautiful that's a beautiful dear bear I don't know but I do know that one doesn't eat the other

<timemark seconds="6543" />

 deers on eat bears you know so if you like if you if you felt like they're both equally beautiful you'd want to protect the deer from the bear man I don't know I know as a hunter I do people always ask me what do you enjoy hunting them out it's whatever I'm hunting I mean I'm I I respect and I'm drawn to all that I like being close to all the animals so it's it's I don't really have a hard time raising them personally well for me

<timemark seconds="6574" />

 I just like the ones are delicious

<timemark seconds="6578" />

 they're all pretty delicious they are the we hunt yeah they are a variety of it I just like the fact that I'm not getting meat from some fucking factory farm yeah the people that are getting meat from the store and from Burger King they're still sitting on hunters and saying you got a little dick like you being silly silly reaching out is growing exponentially daily on Who Wants to be a hunter who wants to provide for themselves and their family and really sees the draw to that and that is some it's the natural way it's it's everyday everyday people have in the concern for getting food that has it been painted with antibiotics and hormones yeah getting natural food there's no more natural organic food than an animal that is literally living in the wild to take it out of there so that Arrow hits of the most perfect

<timemark seconds="6639" />

 up until that time generally and it's it's the it's the way it's meant to be really it's you know humans have hunted up until very recently that's for for most of our existence hunting

<timemark seconds="6654" />

 if you just I'll take anybody hunting would you take them I take a bear bear is good because you know it's like your first bow hunt with bear just because it's it's pretty controlled there's a lot of bear you can go on some of these hunts and if you went on an axis deer hunt for your first night you would quit that stuff yesterday so with bear I think it's a good first time and then I can I like to know to explain why we're bear hunting the bear were looking for a religion for the big old male here's how you identified I like being right there so if if I took Kanye hunt hunting it would be bear hunting

<timemark seconds="6697" />

 do you think he would be able to do it I don't know him I mean he's he seems crazy but I don't know where is Conneaut there bear hunting in Wyoming so maybe he didn't answer me about 300 acres in Wyoming is probably sneaker Factory out there are finishing his album right now I think you filter recorded part that I would go with the album again I mean he's also apparently building in the interview he talks about I think he's done some houses or something out there that Kim Kardashian

<timemark seconds="6743" />

 that's some people going to really want to get rid of the bear population is Wyoming's get some fucking Grizzlies and grizzly bears take out the Kardashians well I think you know I think people like she's white laughing Jamie that's terrible that would hey think about it think about the album sales yeah so if you like covered her would be fat and what horror movie send her out there in the woods I think people like Kanye and I don't know about camera but man archery is a discipline people need so I mean I need some discipline that I think our tree can be a could be powerful you know I had sent you that quote I think yesterday about there's like it and there's things you do in your life where there's before you did a man after he did and they're not definitive line right there I think archery can't be a line like that where everything was before and now everything after and stop power

<timemark seconds="6805" />

 watching difficult things are important for people to do you know I mean I think challenges are extremely important if you don't have a challenge you know that the human mind you know we were talking about

<timemark seconds="6815" />

 idle time being the Devil's Playground the human mind needs challenges you need something that's stimulating and intriguing to you and bow hunting is insanely difficult archery forget about bowhunting you just want to eat vegetables all day archery is insanely difficult it's and it's something that requires concentration on all these different levels like mental concentration you have to focus on your posture and your form and make sure that everything's right time either released this shot is right all that stuff requires so much of your focus and so much thought that it cleans your mind that cleans your mind of all these other things all the bullshit and life stress goes away when that Arrow flies through the air hit that Bullseye like it feels amazing that's that's one I had a lot of respect for Ryan thank you and I went back there to DC cuz I took him a bow back there and there's a huge group of people staying around he's shooting an arrow at a

<timemark seconds="6877" />

 call Target in the gymnasium and you know I mean you're putting you're putting yourself out there cuz there's no guarantee you're going to be very good with the bow what he's got one at the Western hunting Expo but I saw him shoot in the air like that the arrow was lined up like you shooting you know down schools instead of what the site saw some old pictures of Ted Nugent used to shoot a compound bow without a release without a site right and he was like looking down the shaft turbo that's a little more that's a little more yeah well that's it that's a compliment that's a recurve I think isn't it hard to tell because you only looking at the top of the Riser but I can't tell

<timemark seconds="6935" />

 but it says Ted Nugent is an irresponsible idiot but he's also got the boat canted sideways to the yeah yeah that's sort of how you do that yeah looking down the arrow that's how he used to hunt he used to shoot with the tiny little stabilizer no site and shoot instinctive a few years back and start shooting with sorry sight you know but so anyway so he was there put himself out there

<timemark seconds="6979" />

 hit the floor and it ricocheted off of the crowd right it's so I respected that you know you take your taking a chance and I just think that that stuff like that is good for people so you know Kanye included man if you want to shoot a few arrows and kill a bear I'll go she doesn't have time for that man is revolutionising fashion dresses men are going to wear dresses song cuz it look like it's what is this all true the dresses if you want to have your finger on the pulse what gaming with the kids God that's amazing what the fuck these kids are up to

<timemark seconds="7035" />

 everything that's for sure I can't I can't keep up with everything in the phone instead of discipline I'm not like Ari shaffir you heard me re going to fucking discipline is that right I mean he talks about it if he gets his phone in his hand like he's like I can't because I'll be late for everything I'll be like 20 minutes late I just sit down I can't get off because I'm powerless wow that's crazy I don't get that that's not good but I do know that not thinking about that stuff for 3 Days made me feel better your is like a cleanse ultimately there's a there's a tremendous amount of pressure in being in the public eye like whether you're in the public eye on social media or public I doing a podcast or anything like that so for me doing nothing but bow hunting

<timemark seconds="7099" />

 6 days like was a it was a very difficult release in that difficult in a difficult task not difficult to like I needed to go back to it quickly difficult in that like bow hunting is hard to do so in doing that thing concentrating on that thing only I wasn't thinking at all about like at Twitter or you are distracted by a stupid shift news know what I liked that last day it was

<timemark seconds="7129" />

 I loved so I killed a buck earlier in the day you guys have been on some stocks you came drove down loaded the backup took it to Bob The Butcher and then so is I think later in the morning normally when it be like okay let's you know go get something to eat will regroup and come back in the afternoon but you're like no I want to keep honey you know you were just so tunnel vision focused on hunting and it was so I was like I was so excited so we were out there and it's getting hot by this time and we're just finding deer glassing deer putting together these stocks and it was just like he was seriously one of

<timemark seconds="7176" />

 sounds stupid I said the best day of my life but I mean that's a perfect day for me it was fun it was it was you guys went down on that stock you and Alec and I found that betted back by himself the wide buck and is just like man what a great day it was an awesome day that's how I would have done been doing all day yeah yeah yeah that's what I'm there to do you know it's yeah and it's you know like I said it's it's like a cleanse something about the difficulty of especially when I was doing it by myself it was all time for wild world stocking on this block by myself without a life without anybody in like this is like it's such a singular Focus you thinking about one thing we just checking the wind checking your range try to close it on I'm putting bushes in between you and him so you can see you have creeping trying to end it

<timemark seconds="7233" />

 there's something about that that's so it's so Primal it just resonates with your DNA there's something about it we're like you get if you get one of those animals and then as you're eating you're going to remember that moment forever going to remember it's not just like getting something from a restaurant from the grocery store it's getting something you're eating something has to give a massive connection to it and that's a video to little bit on that deer I killed that day and I put it on my Instagram story just a little clips about where I was where the buck was kind of the strategy take off my boots and all that and so many people send messages saying that that was fascinating and I don't have Instagram on the highlights it says access talk it out and it's just like I was reading the comments and

<timemark seconds="7294" />

 messages and people saying how fascinating it was and how educational and I'm like

<timemark seconds="7299" />

 on one hand I'm like that's awesome I'm not another had it made me feel bad for him because that's just I've done that so many times and it is it's it's powerful and as it feels like the way it should be but I feel bad for people who have an experience that and so I feel good for you now that you're in that and that but the people sending me messages I'm like I would love to almost be able to share that with them somehow our or I mean that's as good as I can do right now to get started you can go hunting now what was that first boho it went on what year was that 2013 or 14

<timemark seconds="7344" />

 14 so 4 years something like that yeah yeah so for years and it's I don't know it's what what what's change from that first year to this year for you I mean experience for sure more understanding how little I really know it's like one of those think there's a there's a great expression that I think from Dennis McKenna that once the the bonfire of understanding grows the surface area of ignorance is right right is that the bigger the bonfire the more you realize like the more you understand the more you realize how much there is to learn right that's one of the things about hunting with each experience especially something like Lanai which is so it's so difficult it's like

<timemark seconds="7396" />

 the most difficult but mean at least what I've experienced in my short amount of time doing it the most difficult kind of hunting spot and stocking things that are just fucking wired yeah pressured the stock is the most difficult there I mean if you if you have the backpack in the mountains different kind the stock of these and getting bow range making the shot yeah that's yeah it's almost as hard as it gets on the animals that I've hunted there's some antelope in Africa there just as quick but that's a whole different challenge that a whole different knowledge base that you'd have to delve into but as far as stocking and getting those killed with a bow these Axis deer you're right also like I would imagine that backpack hunting in the mountains is also more mentally taxing cuz you can't just go back to the cabin can just go back to the lodge at you're out there

<timemark seconds="7456" />

 in a tent and your 20 miles in and if you break your ankle you're going to die yeah yeah I just have to take that thing up and crawl out of there it's a little better now because people have way more access then when I started when I said there is a you have to get to the top of the mound even get barely cell phone service if that was even possible but now you know there's a lot of yeah yeah yeah a lot of people have access which is still it's it's it's intimidating for a lot of people at the barrier for entries very high yeah it's very hard to get started and I'm just really lucky that I got started because of a podcast the. Got to meet rinella and got it done hunting and I got to meet you and then got into archery and bow hunting and all that stuff in but it's for someone on the outside that's looking in it's extremely difficult but here's what you do you go to a archery Pro Shop most people have those I know there's one down here in San Diego Performance Archery I'm at Scott Eastwood at 1 in Riverside

<timemark seconds="7516" />

 I think it's going to Riverside archery back home it's a bow rack but there's use Pro Shops if that's what they do every day so the key with any hunting any archery hunting you're going to do shooting a bow and shooting it consistently getting those wraps in and that's where you know you can't control the experience you get you know it you that kind of kind of slowly but like what you've taken control of is the repetition and the discipline was shooting an arrow on doing an Acura leave so once you control that part of it the hunting experience is going to come the stock experience the learning the animals I was going to come but at least when you get that opportunity to go to make a shot so for what for new people who are interested get to an archery Pro Shop get set up with a good bow learn how to shoot correctly and do it a lot and then you Branch out and set up the Hunts it's just so difficult to execute a shot on animal weight way different people don't have any idea how much anxiety

<timemark seconds="7576" />

 and how much adrenaline is pumping through your system when you're drawn back on an animal is a consequences are so grave everything is so high stakes it's just it's and you only get this one shot like your it is especially say if you're on a Backcountry hunt you go 20 miles in theirs is 190 inch mule deer just standing there they feeding you get is one shot ass is your one shot even you haven't seen a deer in 6 days and you draw back and arms are shaking and you just try and try to go through your shot process without flinching and fucking panicking and just slamming that trigger like it's fucking people want a shortcut and I was the same way I've been on house like that I've been on Nate Simmons fill me on a hot water was in the Eagle Cap Wilderness and I don't

<timemark seconds="7629" />

 attorney thank you yeah we didn't see

<timemark seconds="7633" />

 God I want to say we didn't see an elk for something like six days

<timemark seconds="7640" />

 I killed a buck on day 7 I think and a bowl on day 8 but there's a long time in there where is like what are we doing so it's really easy when you finally do get that opportunity to want to shortcut from seeing it to holding antlers in Your Hands Music Festival and that's what people rush it they get back and I just want to get that arrow on its way anxiety cuz it sooner and arrow can be going towards that animal that feel like the closer they are to holding that animal to make it a good shot but man you still have to go through if you you can't skip a step and sign is a crazy thing man yeah it's a crazy thing it's like that adrenaline and that the the feeling of discomfort is like this like uncertainty feeling now it just very hard for people to handle but that's with the case of anything we have to perform anything where it's difficult to do or you just like oh my God is it happening is happening right now

<timemark seconds="7697" />

 yeah the rain so it's wired with all these different chemicals that are excreted when that when that moments happening when there's a final event this is it here it is oh my God ready action that's where I think all the Reps you put in paid off cuz on that first box so it was 15 minutes into it was even Alex has been doing that for 30 years has never had a hunt that played out that quickly. Perfectly but I think you told me I'm always I'm always trying to get in to the heads of other hunters in and just want to know what the thought process is but I think you told me that when you're in bow range out of that bike right out of the gate on it early in the hunt didn't you take a few deep breaths and relax do you say that yeah and that's a lot of people there tense their tents because there's so much going on they never relax and that shot is just not going to be at

<timemark seconds="7758" />

 and then just like in your backyard you, you focus you're just as calm as you've done a thousand times and you can pick that spot level that bubble and slowly squeeze that trigger that's when it works that's super hard to do well it was it was happening so fast that before we knew it we would kick their shoes off and we're walking no just with socks on his creeping through the grass and we got to 45 yards he's like you want to get closer I'm like this perfect stop right here under got it yeah I just went to the couple of deep ones and it was feeding and then I'm like okay I know what to do I just did it and went when they walk when I heard that the impact the arrows are holy shit that was a perfect execution yeah it's a weird feeling man once like did that really happen if that really happened they were standing over a picture of it

<timemark seconds="7817" />

 yeah and I say perfect execution not of killing the animal of the shots as a perfect execution of the shot I'm not saying we at for executing animals

<timemark seconds="7827" />

 there's so much physical action involved in pulling the ball back and being in perfect position and making sure you're not torquing the bow and leveling the bubble on the side and pulling with the back muscles and making sure everything's in line and there's no flinching or extra movement and you're concentrating on the exact spot you want that Arrow to hit as the things releasing all under extreme anxiety and pressure in the stings that moving is going to keep walking what's going to happen and there's so much about but the feeling when it's over the relief and then knowing that I'm going to have this organic meat that is the most delicious meat in the world and I'm going to be cooking and I can't wait to cook it and haven't cooked any of it but I can't wait I'm going to cook some tonight I mean I think it's a it's a powerful experience for almost anybody in this one that I know not everybody can hunt underwear you listen to this is probably ever going to hunt but those that do will understand you know and it's not always going to be comfortable

<timemark seconds="7890" />

 it's not always killing animals not people aren't going to have warm and fuzzy feelings about soon animal dead but they are going to there's something about taking responsibility for the meat that you're eating and that's going to be I don't know if relief is a right word but it's it's just a connection that I think they're going to it's going to make more sense well one thing that confuses people with you is when they find out that you run Ultra marathons and you working out all the time like why is he doing all that stuff like why do that to be my very best when I'm in the mountains when I'm hunting people I've seen people go what wait wait a minute you work out everyday you run twice a day you run Ultra marathons but to test yourself so that when you're hunting you could be at your very best

<timemark seconds="7941" />

 yeah that's right I don't think people understand how much it means to me I feel like I owe it to the animal to be at my best I feel like if the animal stuffers longer than then I believe it should that's I don't like dealing with that I don't like that that's why I feel like I said there's a way to bet on my shoulder shoulders where I need to be at my best as a hunter and to do that I put in work I prepare every day and I just want to know that I'm going to be merciful when it comes time to kill the animal you're also going to be in shape enough to get the position to get to the animal n have your heart rate drop down and also the ass stay calm this is why you do so much cardio yeah yeah you know on this hunt I felt all that work out exactly how it was supposed to quit very quick clean deaths and then you know I can about that I killed a couple days ago that second Bach I was able to

<timemark seconds="8002" />

 you know there's something about putting the addendum on your shoulders and packing it out that you know it's just part of the process it just feels right yeah but for a lot of people so crazy like you when you run a marathon a day so you could be in shape to go hunting down can you just go hunting you can I'm not here to judge anybody or tell somebody that they need to do what I do or they're doing it wrong I'm saying that's what people that you know hunting is such a personal Journey you know when people say maybe hunting is fun for some people maybe for some people it is fun to kill an animal I don't know for me it's not a people said oh you can admit it it's fun I might I know what it means to me what it means to me is I need to be at my very best to be at my very best I need to run a marathon a day I need to work harder than I've ever worked so I'm at the top of my game on the hunt I don't care what you

<timemark seconds="8062" />

 about that or I don't care about your mindset I'm not talking about you I'm talking about me and that's people have a hard time with that will they have a hard time believing first of all you run a marathon a day even you saying that I'm like this guy I feel like he's full of shit yeah and it's not supposed to take 6 months off and do nothing it's true it's true

<timemark seconds="8082" />

 man you know it is not all the time it's what I do is I get up in the morning I'll get 6 miles done fasted cardio in people at Bennett people also like to to say why they don't do it is because I spend time with my family say shut the fuk up I spend time with my family too so anyway I get up while they're still sitting there sleeping yeah yeah I go before any buddies up the second time I run is at lunch and I got to get out of the office I got a regular 9 to 5 job drives me insane because I'm meant to be in the mountains but hey I got a job at the best job I ever had on I want to do a good job for the company I work for been there 21 years but to be at my best there I need a break at lunch so I say they said what hey do you want to be superintendent of the water department on my yeah I'll be superintendent but I'm going to run everyday at lunch and if they would have said and I can't do that I'm like well I'm not going to pretend to thin but they said okay you can do that

<timemark seconds="8145" />

 I like all right I'll come in early I'll stay late will make it work so that's my second one I can't spend time with my family at lunch they're not going to come to my work and sit in the lunchroom with me so I go running and how far do you run at lunch at lunch I'll try to get if I if I'm trying to get a marathon done today I don't go to the mountain I just go flatten I get at least $13 lunch so see you at 9:19 before you can get home so then the last run of the day on my way home from work I'll go to the mountain I'll get that last seven or eight done and that's free runs a day and I'll be a mess on a day that's a lot of fucking running now it's not a hundred percent healthy I don't feel banged up I don't feel anything and that's a question always get what how do you people say well how are you recover and how do you already have so much muscle

<timemark seconds="8205" />

 well I weigh 170 lb I'm not I don't have like muscle everywhere so I'm not big but I also eat meat all the time every day you know you talked about the Lions and wherever with the river and they were eating to Buffalo they were Jack you going to have protein so if you can run a marathon a day if you're eating salad you're going to weigh 240 lb okay if you run a marathon a day and you're eating steak 3 times a day you going to retain some muscle so that's what I do I know what my body needs for calories and I know when I'm at my best when I have excess calories to burn that's what I do I make sure I'm eating non-stop but you're also lifting weights I do how do you have the time to do all this time like listening to the schedule like this is ridiculous and then you shoot your bow means that the family the family time is about from us how to get home at about 6:30

<timemark seconds="8260" />

 tell about and then people are going to be going to bed at 10 so that's Fox News time hanging out on you know really where you are at night we like to get to place these liberals Luke's on American around American Idol Luke Bryan's on there so watch that a little bit sometimes my daughter my daughter do she loves the voice and such fun it's fine to get into that so that's what I do and I can if I'm just doing the Coast raps like during the workweek is generally just at my house just you know 20 yards shooting my bow and that's in his just and then went out lift on Monday Wednesday Friday I lift right after work and I'll going Outlaw strength and you know sometimes Nick the trainer dude hammered out as to go home at the same time so on those days

<timemark seconds="8319" />

 I'm not going to get a marathon done a day on those 3 days do you feel like shit on those days cuz you didn't get your Marathon then no cuz lifting his heart it let you know it's hard but I'm in the back I'll be honest I'm not normal I get it but in the back of my mind I'm thinking

<timemark seconds="8336" />

 I kind of suck a little bit cuz I didn't get a marathon.

<timemark seconds="8340" />

 That is so crazy yeah. That's what I'm thinking like when you run an ultra and to see if you run a hundred miles or more what what kind of demons are going through your head when you're out there running I don't I don't know if it's just I don't know what it is it's like the Moab 240 in 3 days while you're at Day 2 and 1/2 what I'm thinking is I'm I'm honoring myself by getting the absolute most out of my I don't think I've I've reached my limit I think I think if you're not getting the most out of your body you're not you're not taking advantage of your life that you're not honoring your life so to me

<timemark seconds="8383" />

 I need to find what my limit is

<timemark seconds="8387" />

 I can't halfway it I can't help it because I feel like that I'm not man that's not I don't know why I can't live with myself if I if I don't feel like I have given everything that I have the weird thing about running is like as you run more Your Capacity to run more increases so you realize like o like the body has more capability than you think because you just have to get it a custom to this amount of work and then you could just do it all the time and then it gets used to it and then it grows expands and then your threshold and what your expectations are they increase to so in the beginning you were saying that when you first started running like running a 5k is like holy shit this is harder a 10K is brutal you would never think a man can I do a marathon right now you're fucking doing a marathon everyday and this is the same person it's not like you know you are I've always first time I started running around a fucking ultramarathon you know it's not

<timemark seconds="8447" />

 no no no no and that's I mean that's everything that's everybody and everything you work up to it and so that it's no different from me I just feel like I'm finally getting to my potential and I wasted a lot of years not living up to my potential so when I do the running videos and I'm smiling I'm in a good mood that's a genuine cuz I'm like this is my potential yeah I can't be happy sitting at home watching TV I'm going to do it because I love my family I'm going to hang out and do that but I can't be I don't feel like that's my potential

<timemark seconds="8482" />

 this this is the thing that I think is very important for people like you and I think a lot of people it's that in achieving goals and I'm pushing hard there is a release of anxiety that I think overwhelmed a lot of people from most of their life most of I know a lot of people that are overwhelmed by anxiety and most of those people that I know they're overwhelmed by anxiety don't push themselves I think there's a connection there physically pushing yourself to your limit all the time whether it's lifting weights or Jiu-Jitsu or running or whatever you do that strenuous I think it's a requirement for the human body that we think of as an option I don't think it's an option I don't think so especially not for mental health I think I think it's really critical I think I think really hard exercises one and I don't care what you do with your swimming or what it whatever you like whatever you enjoy the mountain

<timemark seconds="8543" />

 but I think really hard exercise is one of the most important requirements for like a happy healthy life I really do I thank a man I could say that maybe I try to justify what I do to try to

<timemark seconds="8560" />

 put logic to it maybe even what you're saying is is

<timemark seconds="8565" />

 is a little bit of justification I don't know so I don't know if what I do is right or what we should be doing I don't know I just know how I feel when I do it but that doesn't mean I don't have regrets sometimes like even with my kids now that they're older and you know I really struggled wondering if the message I've been sending to my family about averages a failure if you're not giving your best

<timemark seconds="8595" />

 you're not honoring your life basically and then I'm like

<timemark seconds="8600" />

 maybe that's okay for some people maybe not everybody needs to run a marathon a day and they're fine and they're happy it's like who am I to say what make somebody else happy just like I get mad when somebody tells me how I should feel I can't say why they need it so then I was like here's my kids my boys who are great young man strong have all the potential in the world have I somehow have I said being just a regular guy has a job on comes home there's something wrong with that and I'm like God did I screw up and it's just like it's really been bought cuz my son quit a good job as a deputy my oldest and he join the Army because he says he has more to offer this world

<timemark seconds="8644" />

 that's hard is it hard because well it's hard first of all because your son is joining the military and you like wow my son could go to combat and I could lose him but is it also hard because you feel like your high expectations for yourself

<timemark seconds="8662" />

 might have said a bar for him that maybe doesn't line up with his initial expectations you've made him think that whatever might have made him happy before is not good enough right and that's what I thought you know I was like

<timemark seconds="8679" />

 it was it was hard to deal with when he was leaving and I'm like what did I do

<timemark seconds="8687" />

 so you know I told him you know I am sorry if I ever made you feel that that being a regular average person there something wrong with that and he said you know did the example that I've set growing up was that to work hard and chief me down big goals and and that's and that's what he wants to do and so he he said you know he said that was for him and then my my younger son who's in his third year of college now he I have the same talk with him and I just said I'm you know I'm sorry if if I've done something to make it feel like you know being being average was a failure and he said that he wants to graduate he wants to join the service and maybe try to go to Special Forces 2 for the same reason and so I don't know I don't know they don't act they act completely fine with it and they let you know they love working hard and

<timemark seconds="8749" />

 big goals to achieve and that part feels good but sometimes I wonder if you know I don't know I just second-guess myself I guess

<timemark seconds="8760" />

 yeah it's hard high expectations you put on kids it's very difficult like you want to say I just want them to be happy yeah I just want them to live their lives on their path in the rain like every kid has their own personality and you know your three kids are all uniquely different in their own way and who's to say I mean who's to say I think all you can do is live by example and and support them and let them make the choices they said that they decide to make the choices that they've made are you know very stressful and very dangerous yeah you know I mean it might turn out today might turn out like Tim Kennedy or someone like Andy Stomp and being awesome human being

<timemark seconds="8801" />

 but it's for you as a parent this is this incredibly stressful pressure-filled situation where you have to reevaluate how you raise them and I told them growing up always was I don't care if you're the best at whatever you're doing but could cuz not everybody can be the best but I said just give your best just be your best as last rites if either Coast in whatever I'm I I think you got some more you got some more in you and that's all I ever wanted about stuff they have

<timemark seconds="8837" />

 but I thought of doing better and they just don't put in the effort they feel like shit you know you they feel like shit for you telling them that but they feel like shit for for not doing well too and yeah especially if they have an ambition if he unrealized potential is a very fucking horrible feeling and unrealized potential and unrealized expectations are just like this feeling you haven't done enough will keep you up at night yeah I will fuck with your head and that's I just know how I felt not giving all I got and I don't want I didn't want my kids to feel like that so I was just make sure you're giving your best be your best that's it and but then I then I was like what have I done so it's you know I can only speak for myself you know when I when I when Tanner was born I was young

<timemark seconds="8892" />

 I don't you know being a parent is like I feel like I'm better now than I was when I was 24 years old and you know hopefully I'm pretty. Maybe more. Different with my daughter she's also a girl so it's it is just that's different but man it's like there's no blueprint on how to be the perfect parent and now I'm like I hope I did okay yeah just there's no blueprint I mean what's the blueprint be be honest give them the best version of your thoughts on life that you can give them spend time with them when you can then what is the what is the blueprint mean just try to help them figure out their path in life and it's also hard to because you got a full-time job. How much time do you dedicate to them in a how much time can you have yeah I mean it would be great if I'd be like I'm not going to work anymore I'm just going to hang out with the kids all day I mean it's not realistic

<timemark seconds="8954" />

 we can't do it and then also to be the example I felt like I would needed to set for the kids so they believe they could achieve whatever they wanted to I had to put in work myself I can't say you can be amazing while I'm

<timemark seconds="8970" />

 passing stuff when you say that you didn't reach your full potential until like later in life like when do you feel like that was I haven't know but I mean like you realize that you're like really pushing to reach your full potential now I still don't think I have a but you're pushing towards it I'm doing more and so on when did that change

<timemark seconds="8991" />

 God

<timemark seconds="8997" />

 I don't know maybe maybe when I did my first hundred so that's 2009 I felt would what's a cruel sacrifice was and

<timemark seconds="9009" />

 I don't know you know hard hunts when Roy and I would do super hard Hans I felt like I was giving all I got back pack hunts deer the backcountry 2008 I mean I always did what I did Hard Times by myself and Eagle cab but there's not really a great chance of dying in the Eagle Cap you know it's you could but you know that I felt like I was I was giving all I had on on the hunt that require the most of me and then at that same time so that was 2007/2008 then at the same time I was also wrapping up what I did with it running and push my body 200 Mi and things like that because you realize that you needed more endurance I just realized I had I had I've been doing what I've been telling my kids not to do I've been coasting

<timemark seconds="9063" />

 you know it still was more than a lot of people are doing but to me it felt like I wasn't living up to my full potential so I'm like you know I want to do more and then that led to Moab and that when I meet people and see people that are doing amazing things as just shows me what's possible and so that's why I know I can I have more to offer that's a fascinating thing that you know you just take these steps towards this journey and then you realize as you're making these steps that your capacity for work is increasing so you have to push yourself further to test your body and then yellow a marathon seems Out Of Reach but then the marathon becomes a normal thing and then a 50-miler and then a hundred Miler than 205 Mi 238th Mile and now you were talking to the day with I guess Candice was considering 500 MI

<timemark seconds="9116" />

 Courtney and I said both said we do it and it would just be amazing it would be you know what I mean that's what people do those type of races live for the next big Challenge and you know when you haven't what did you cross the finish line like I did Moab and Courtney did she do you know Dominic had a great race and that race but she you when you get finished I finish line in your smiling you're like a little more got some more left the sound of something epic like 500 non-stop is is so incredible that sounds so insane that you would run 230 miles to be basically halfway done yeah I know but listen when we were a hundred miles in a hundred miles is a long way and I told my brother was With Me Taylor I go you know it's a different thought when you're not even halfway you

<timemark seconds="9180" />

 got a hundred a hundred is hurts yeah but you're not half way so it's the same thing

<timemark seconds="9187" />

 well I need a year can I do that yeah and every year I need 10 hours sleep at night I was listening to Matthew Walker dr. Matthew Walker say to me 10 hours already night she asks yeah I had one I had a one she slept 20-some minutes Toma she was there and I did the exact same thing for one minute because he was watching the watch and I fell asleep there's a picture and I woke up I was like how long was I sleeping he goes a minute I'm like what's ago and it for whatever reason that minute it doesn't I don't know what else to do but she said I don't have no idea so long I know you only slept for a minute oh shit let's go yeah that's that's one thing I learned in that first 200 I did Richard won that race and that was a mistake I made is

<timemark seconds="9252" />

 I was asking how how long he been sleeping that was what you said because he is like and he said that he says I was the greatest day of my life and it said Richard Kessler but he said he was sleeping short durations like 15 minutes and I didn't realize that your body will reset that quick yeah yeah and plus you know I'm sitting here sound like it's got is really hard to be good at Ultra marathoning and also want a pack of milk muscle what I weigh is not going to so I kind of throwing myself in the category of Richard and in a Courtney can't my I can't do it at what I do so I get the best of both worlds and it's just you're going to give up on both ends

<timemark seconds="9310" />

 is you ran his want to Randy he was on the podcast us record of a hundred miles and 11 hours and 40 minutes averaging 7 minutes and yeah one second let me know was it 11 hours and 40 minutes so I think you ran a 7 minute frame seconds per mile which is a fucking Madness best Besame so fast that's impressive high fat High stay high steak and protein diet yeah well it's so yeah I mean to be that to be the optimal endurance athlete Ultra endurance athlete in the mountains you need to be lighter I weigh too much so you need to have some weight on you to be the best at bowhunting I'm not doing it to be the best runner and I'm not

<timemark seconds="9373" />

 saying I could be I don't have the talent that I'm pretty tough but I mean bet they're super tough and super talented what is a talent for running what's the talent Left Foot Right Foot Left Foot Right Foot it's not enough saying it's not like you're there's a difference I don't know if that's it, but it's theirs having great endurance is a thing it's certainly a thing and managing the body to get the most out of that endurance doing most of it is is in Courtney said there's two she didn't realize how far she could push in the paint she was into her first hundred she quit

<timemark seconds="9417" />

 400 Mi or she dropped out of cuz she was in pain I was it and she's like I can't do this and then she quit and she's like what a second

<timemark seconds="9427" />

 I quit for no reason I quit this cuz I was in pain so then after that she realized pain is just part of the deal and has a quit censoring and she just didn't realize that the pain quotient of those races it doesn't feel good just cuz it. Most people can't push that push through that amount of pain it hurts the worst pain I've ever felt What Hurts the Most

<timemark seconds="9457" />

 that just depends like I've run and my foot starts hurting I might come I got this is probably broke my foot maybe stress fracture then all the sudden my other knee hurts on my oh my okay my my ligament is got Tight cuz I got dehydrated as rubbing on my bone it's like I'll wait no this other right hip hurt it's just like everything hurts different things your feet could beat up you got blisters you're getting dry it out. So things are just things are different in your body like I got up a bone on top of my foot that rubs and if I get dried out that stuff's not sliding well enough so that rubs and it swells up more so it's just like

<timemark seconds="9499" />

 all sorts of things happen

<timemark seconds="9501" />

 yeah people want everything to feel good I don't feel comfortable and you shouldn't push too hard but she just smiled just be comfortable he's just be comfortable yes that's the biggest thing is people you know there's this guy too that's that's been following me I love I love the guy and he's like so he sees the pictures he follows along he's like well I want to do a hundred miles an hour and cuz it sounds amazing right right and I signed up to do a hundred on my brother just just did recently called Badger Mountain

<timemark seconds="9538" />

 had done it before I think he came and run Pisgah did about for Summit ones about 16 miles or whatever and went out and he's going to do a hundred mile or after that and started throwing up a like Mal 30 threw up like 13 times and couldn't walk with the hydrated throwing up and it was a hardest thing to do but he had to drop and that so there's your getting your body to a place where you can run that far and then so that's part he hasn't been there yet and I think part of that was he wasn't taking insult there's a lot of lot of things that go on with pushing your body that heart but he got 50 miles done for me I thought that was a great success because just people just because they want to run a hundred doesn't miss necessarily mean you're going to there's a lot of things I have to go into preparation in the tactics in it and fueling and everything else learning just like Courtney did learning just like he

<timemark seconds="9600" />

 he got 50 in and now we signed up for bigfoot so he's going to do 205 miles to 205 miles sick in the head. I think they're all getting sick together I think he can do it but and that's just as part of the process of learning what what you're capable of and it's not even like that when you say take salt in like what are you what are you doing a scab so it's just all pills but that's all give you high blood pressure it's bad for you but when you're sweating on stop it doesn't give you high blood pressure folks house not bad for you okay so it's a fucking bad study for Mike the nineteen-seventies of people recite salts an essential mineral so when you're when you're doing and how much you take it in take I take salt every hour but how much salt couple pills a couple of capsules of a scab so it's a couple caps like if you don't

<timemark seconds="9659" />

 you won't make it really

<timemark seconds="9662" />

 wow so it's just your body just gets too dehydrated efficient and what is the water in the Salt Lake has it what is it what is what's happening when you taking salt I don't know but you know is everybody does it. I'm not sure exactly but all I know is I remember the first time I did western states have only done it once but it was a hundred mile in 2010 and I got two mile 55 I think I was dragging ass come out of the canyon the super hot and there's you know 90s or 100s in Canyon City, pop out on the mile 55 and I was hurting and Sean misner who's been a very good Ultra runner for a long time he's like you taking so long, I know I have it so he gave me some salt right then and it made it took a little while but made the biggest difference. Just salt so you never taken saw before heading I didn't take it

<timemark seconds="9723" />

 55 Mi oh wow so then you just got to get in that community and understand what they do and how they survive and how they feel and how many people are entering erase what I did it with your two years goes I think 70 some now I think she's over over a hundred and all these races wow it's what Candice always says 200 200 is the new 100 or 100 was out like a long way 202 when did shift over that like

<timemark seconds="9762" />

 maybe 2016 and when I did Bigfoot may be right in there that's really recent yeah so this whole sport is kind of evolving right now hundreds the $200 and it's evolving based on how far people can that are willing to push themselves are continuing to go past the boundaries

<timemark seconds="9783" />

 so when does 500 does take place when do they think that's going to happen she hopes do it next year yeah I got one I got one after another one I'm taking over from here to do it terrible am definitely terrible at business that's a fact it's not possible number one thing I hate more than anything is when business screws up my passions so when I hate the business of hunting it sounds weird because I'm probably sitting here because of the business of hunting but I can't stand it the business of like the industry involved in hunting gear and goods and all that stuff yeah

<timemark seconds="9838" />

 yellow hunting I love the connection with animals I love doing what I do and I know I have value like I get it I mean I heard about you because I put my name on stuff and they sell it

<timemark seconds="9849" />

 I hate it that's why we're good at it I don't know I think those two are correlated you know I'm fucking terrible at the business part of Comedy you know I mean I just I just wanted to do it I don't I don't like thinking about the money part yeah I know that's why I have managers and agents right they take care of everything so I can just be free and if you're not eat it I N Out you only have certain amount of resources and if you put all your resources into the business side how you going to have the concentration to do all the other things you're doing right practice shooting and running all the other different things to my phone didn't work for 4 days or 3 days whatever it was is that how much time I'm wasting

<timemark seconds="9901" />

 how much energy I'm wasting

<timemark seconds="9903" />

 you can only interact so much with other people's thoughts and ideas and information and you you have a lot of things already in your head that you're going over and thinking about and managing and the more shit you stuff in there it doesn't make you better at doing those original to lose it dilutes it and it also deleted my my peace of mind like

<timemark seconds="9934" />

 I think you know did you join have certain amount of resources in your life and you have to choose what's important to you and what's not you know and I think it's real easy to get distracted it's real easy to flood your brain with nonsense I think so you know I'm not I'm not like I'm good at a few things so I try to focus on those the business part yeah you can take that over for me yeah I'll take it over for you I'm not even good at it but I'm good I'm good I'm good at is I know people that I like and what I like about them and what's he asking about them and I like promoting people I can spoil things that I've gotten out of this podcast that is there's a lot of things that have gotten out of this podcast that I really like unexpected approved the one of them is the ability to make my friends famous like this podcast is made Joey Diaz famous and Ari shaffir famous and Duncan Trussell Family

<timemark seconds="9995" />

 people that I think are amazing better hope I got a chance to let other people know about them and that's the only reason why I. That means a lot to me to help people like it that's something that's very very rewarding to me and it's almost along the same lines of being able to provide as a hunter and provide food like to be unable to provide to let people know he's got to see this guy this guy's awesome or even things people that I even I don't even know people like their documentary I see a documentary is fucking amazing I want to tell people about it I like promoting things without any expectation of something coming back to me in return I like I just like tell you like 5 people say like you know you doing ads for products on your Instagram never have everything that I've ever put up on Instagram and less it's my own stuff must suck my fanny packs or something I sell anything that I've ever put it put on

<timemark seconds="10056" />

 like people so choose me of like working for Vibram Five Finger shoes I like them I like them I don't want anything from them and all this is what I wear them all the time this is why I think they're good I think they build your feet up I know my feeder stronger cuz I run with these things yeah that's the one thing of having Financial Independence that's that's really rewarding is that I don't have to think like that yeah I know I got been offered to do as on Instagram like I can't because the last I saw him less was something I super believed in that I may consider doing it but I could never do it with some nonsense like Coca-Cola or something like that because then Skinny Tea what's on Instagram single fucking got I go to sleep what's that called again what are you doing what's going on

<timemark seconds="10111" />

 the dunking say it no it's like popular

<timemark seconds="10121" />

 I will we talk about a dinner yeah I remember doubles Duncan just kept going on about Lil B Lil B The BasedGod also saying like the kids new and Mike there's a word Zeitgeist yes Jamie is online all day and he's just ever ever since the Eddie Bravo podcast has been blocking people blocking Rampage

<timemark seconds="10156" />

 that's that's like so what is Skinny Tea what is that paid to promote those well wasn't that thing you were telling me the garyvee was saying that you know you can get a lot of money for your Instagram post house and followers I believe you can get up to about $5,000 per post so crazy there was a script I want to sell out now I'm offering my services to anything that sucks there's this girl and I can't remember who she was in the movie account

<timemark seconds="10202" />

 she was getting 65,000 and Instagram post in 20,000 a story post she said she bought a house for doing what do I what do I sell out to who do I sell out to anybody everyone you know I've been promoting for free

<timemark seconds="10227" />

 you owe me the only thing I would ever promote is the same thing I feel about the the stuff that I promote for free yeah we have to be something that I like believe it came to me and said you are if they actually put your picture up me and you beautiful around you are joking about you like helping your friends but I don't know how long the powerful Joe Rogan how long is a powerful Joe Rogan been around this saying yeah yeah but the point is is like now that this is powerful because if I put up hey where'd you hear about or where to start following me from or where did you hear about what I do 80% is Joe Rogan show

<timemark seconds="10288" />

 experience and it so it it's been a saying for a long time but it is powerful and this lady said she was in her 60s walked up to us to Bert Kreischer what the fuck I texted me go do that was crazy cuz he was like wow it goes that's a hit me what the fuck I'm reaching like middle-aged ladies yeah yeah yeah we're middle age if everything goes perfect with science today I think we're probably not even I think we're probably 1:30 aged easy today that someone's going to live to be 150 I don't think there's any questions whatsoever yeah but stem cell treatments and all this other crazy 950 I believe that today

<timemark seconds="10347" />

 LG and medical science physics increasing its viability and its potential so fast and so many people working on things all the time that if you do everything right right now I think Brenda see people that are alive today they going to hit 150 the people that are born like 5 years from now 10 years now they're probably had 200 before we go before we go Chicago UFC good one so I was telling them that Jon Jones might slap them oh I'm just saying be careful who you talk shit to talking shit to Jon Jones it's not a bad ass mother fucking ass ever lived a lot of money for the title is going to fight Hotmail dos anjos for the inter inter inter

<timemark seconds="10408" />

 is not just because he's beating good guys cuz he has a beat Demian Maia but it's more importantly that he's got he's going to put asses in the seats that's part of the fight business Spotify business now I mean yeah especially now that me and post Conor McGregor and post Conor McGregor the fucking game has changed everything is different I see people hate on it on Colby for you know did he deserve the shot at all I know is he wins one fight he's holding the belt yeah I mean if you look at one more fight and not one pull up is Michigan's record you look at who is beating in comparison to Summit like there's some people that have been calling him out that can't get a fight with him like tomorrow loose man wants to fight him in there is a beast yeah and then there's some other guys that are really talented but haven't beaten like any high-level guys yet

<timemark seconds="10465" />

 okay so we lost a Worley Alvarez Bryan barberena is a good guy dong young Kim is it as a tough guy stun gun came and gave me my that is not really I mean I'm just going to be honest this is not a resume of someone who you would normally see fighting for the title right now I think he's fighting for the title based not just on his beat beating Damian Marley it was a really tough guy but I think

<timemark seconds="10495" />

 the fact that he's a controversial very popular character that you talk so much shit and because you talk so much shit about Brazilians and her daughter Maya over a titled a former titletown giraffe who's the top level guy who's also 40 years old I mean Damien Maya is is best days are behind him just has a huge Demian Maia fan take too much away from Colby because I think of a lot of great fighter say so if you say Nate Diaz who's been an icon for years one of my favorite of all time he's never fought for title right now so if Kobe got there however he got there he wins one more fight he's holding up belt I think about fighters who come up and maybe if they've been in Oakland

<timemark seconds="10556" />

 maybe they haven't sold their fights maybe like as as well as Colby has and grinding it out good guys maybe because it taking it slow Road maybe somebody gets lucky and one of these fights in and catches mom to chin and then there were two wrongs back and they got to grind all the way back up that's a lot of damage they're taking record we didn't have to be mean he played the game the right way for today and it's paying off has one loss in one now but you know but other people would say We'll look at guys like Anderson Silva didn't talk any shit just fucked people up yeah you know and became one of the greatest of all time because of that yeah that's true you know you could look at it like do you want to get that shot at the title or do you want to be the greatest that's ever done it like how it what is the difference I would rather get the title and then show on the greatest I mean

<timemark seconds="10609" />

 Woodley right we will definitely get a fight with Woodley if he wins one hundred percent right so what if what if that happens and what if they showed a video to understand how the fuck he did this but Tyron Woodley has a video up on Instagram with him and Tiki ghosn and he's hitting the pads he just had fucking shoulder surgery yeah I mean he had shoulder surgery what watch this

<timemark seconds="10641" />

 mean you're fucking shoulder surgery like 4 months ago and he's firing up as I don't even know how he did this

<timemark seconds="10648" />

 what shoulder that won that right yes

<timemark seconds="10654" />

 he looks like a freaking Beast he is a fucking beast beast

<timemark seconds="10660" />

 Kobe says he's a nerd get the fuck out of here just getting ready C's talk shit about him for sure it's amazing he puts people to sleep it's just insane that that shoulder was operated on 

<timemark seconds="10680" />

I want to say like 4 months ago I don't even understand it like 4 months after shoulder surgery supposed to be like doing like the little pink way to chase use and pilates class supposed to be doing this I don't get it I mean but it's very smart and he's very smart was Rehabilitation gas doing PRP stem cells everything you can to rejuvenate all that tissue but that's just that's insanely impressive unless unless that is an old video that he's

<timemark seconds="10712" />

baby scared yeah I want is Aegis yeah yeah I mean you just beat Jorge Mas but you know you know you know I get Kobe's worked out with me you know he's from We're from the same town back there and so people are you support whatever like he's a blah blah blah that's just like he's just doing his job I don't want to be selling of Kai's game but that's not how he is in real life then there's the nicest people ever so it's just like it's a Smart Lock guys younger than smart moved it worked for it though

<timemark seconds="10774" />

you know all I know is he one more fight and he's got the UFC belt that interim belt belt is about I don't care what kind of belt whatever cuz he's got an injury to be around his waist so it'll be in this fucking his trophy cabinet exactly so I think I love you have some fun that's going to pull up that June UFC card that is a killer card there's some real good fights on that card is that the card with Derrick Lewis and Francis ngannou

<timemark seconds="10825" />

oh God I don't think so is it I want to say it is I don't think I want to see it is which ones that is that Vegas Whitaker Romero Jeezy biggest daddy can see that he's a freak A Freak bro the freak of the old green vs Curtis blaydes to CM Punk versus Michael Jackson both guys zero and one fucking killer bro Megan Anderson is going to be our first fight in UFC she's a Legit Beast and a challenge at 1:45 that's fucking awesome we got our last you got a legend

<timemark seconds="10880" />

yeah God damn this is very good I really hope not all these fall through like normal well we have only a month and then it'll be one of my way fighting Romero Whittaker yellow Romero is a fucking bang and fight for Chicago versus Covington now that's the fight that's the fight cuz dos anjos at 170 has been a fucking monster is he's one of those guys that was cutting so much weight to make 150 I just couldn't take it anymore it was just beating his body up and then he moves up to 170 and he looks like a fucking killer again he looks like a world-beater at 170 and he's been trying to fight Woodley and he just beat the shit out of Robbie Lawler yeah so that's a big fight for him and a big fight for Colby

<timemark seconds="10946" />

for the interim title can't wait till then marathons Toronto arrows to shoot that strictly which go shoot some arrows supposed to tell you who I got a lot of fucking people going down a lot of podcast this week in Chandler I love him to Matt Taibbi will be here this week my friend Mike Baker I got a lot of shit happening
