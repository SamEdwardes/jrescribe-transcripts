<timemark seconds="584" />

that's it and on with the show

<timemark seconds="588" />

but some quick getting better these am I guess today is one of the most requested guests and so we finally have answered your request he is an online conservative commentator he has a very popular online show that I was actually listening to on the way over here he's if you're into Politics the Ben Shapiro show is his show I bet you can guess who he is now it's Ben Shapiro please welcome

<timemark seconds="625" />

set a reminder check it out The Joe Rogan Experience

<timemark seconds="634" />

Ben Shapiro we are live the people have spoken well thank you for having me it was glorious like right away immediately and he literally said how dare you which is what I say with the people all the time when I'm joking you say when interviewer during the break I sent him thanks so much for having me any kind of growled at me she was not a happy camper and my other favorite ones was Chelsea Handler crushing up where she was literally talk talk to me in the break the break to check on your phone and check in Twitter and any Italians like oh no he just weird British tabloid

<timemark seconds="694" />

you found out that the company that you work for did really creepy shit like check people's voice at all maybe she still alive yes it is you have a British accent we automatically add 20 points your IQ rate for like selling mops late-night nonstick cookware and I enjoyed I think John Oliver's great apparently he has you know a lot of people think of all British act back sense of being the same but he has like blue collar British accent but I don't know I can't wait for later or something

<timemark seconds="754" />

but yeah Oliver's his his recent one was fucking hilarious I don't know if you seen it coming. Funny about Alex Jones you got to meet Alex I don't know that given how much I made fun of him to calm down he would come around after Alex's on Piers Morgan die because he had that whole debate with Alex and Alex said his stick and was really over-the-top and he thought I was going to be like Alex Jones cartoon is going to be Piers again and Alex and I could not be more different than you know you're very rational and very reasonable and you know where we've been talking about some of your debates there's not a lot of guys like you out there which is really interesting it's like you are up fast Thinking Fast

<timemark seconds="814" />

talking very smart young guy who's also a conservative like there's not a lot of those out there and this is one of the separation between the left and the right to the point where the right is like almost non-existent or at least doesn't have any representation and they're actively shunning that representation like they're pushing people out I know what's going on with you and Berkeley is that I actually spoke that before any of this happened I smoke you see broken like April 2016 and then Milo was supposed to speak there and he actually went there and there was a riot where antifa infiltrated the student community in there all these pictures of them bombing things

<timemark seconds="874" />

directions to stopher I kept saying we have safety problems we can't figure out how to do the event and in the end they just cancelled it because didn't have security and then young America's Foundation sponsors me to go to and a half ago and a half months advance and Berkeley said we have no videos available and so this seemed to be another cover for we're not going to allow conservative on campus because their security problems so we made that public and then Brooklyn said no no we'll make sure that you get in you and yes I will you know what happened with Jordan Peterson yesterday yes just yesterday Jordan Peterson was banned from YouTube and YouTube has a new policy that it's very weirdly worded but apparently they're allowed to block and restrict any kind of videos that are about religion or that could be defensive which is almost everything

<timemark seconds="934" />

that's right anything that remotely if they block like 10 other videos a couple of months ago this is nasty stuff and they have the right to do what they want but don't Proclaim that you're a free speech promoting institution if you can block people like Jordan Peterson 4.6 wealth of the problem is they're not blocking things that are offencive to other people if they're not blocking certain things that are representing Islam in a positive light there's a there's a lot of weirdness with this left-wing choice of what two sensor and what not to censor and it's it's not just dangerous it's also bad for the whole idea of being Progressive or being a liberal cuz it makes you look it makes them look really Petty and really weird and resistant hesitant to actually have real debate

<timemark seconds="994" />

pressure and this is one of the reasons why I'm I'm very meticulous in my terminology about people who are on the other side of the eyelash you separate people who are liberal from people who left us so when they're people who try to ban them leftist and if they are not Justin Jennings Beach the government they disagree on politics but they're still willing to have a conversation and they want an open Forum people who are on the hard left think that it's actually an insult to their identity to disagree with them and this is what I experience sometimes on on campus housing at Cal State LA work there's an ear right when I speaker University of Wisconsin where people storm the stage and stand in front of it won't leave and state actually ban me out right sometimes you get this routine from people who think that that they complete their Viewpoint with their identity and then if you have a different view point you're denying them their humanity and no I'm not I just think that's a very good and when you

<timemark seconds="1054" />

Posey's people when you have these debates of these people what's really fascinating is the level of a stereo that gets reached while you're staying calm relatively calm just as a human being and very often when I'm debating some reason getting more and more and more emotional than right love this because of course it's the triggering of the snowflakes he doesn't know his ass from a hole in the ground and it what what's what's hard to do is actually discuss issues with somebody who's intelligent enough to make the to make the point but it's I don't have to travel with two members of security to every campus just so you don't know which campus is going to go off I never had to travel security before it's the weirdest thing in the world I started traveling with security so I spoke to University of Missouri didn't know they had a big blow up at 8 University of Missouri with black lives matter taking over campus offices and suggesting there some sort of the great schism problem it Mizzou which is just ridiculous

<timemark seconds="1114" />

and so they speak there and then the next time I spoke was Cal State LA and they brought in a couple of security guys and what do I need security for me to speak now I can't we get to the campus and they'd already tried to cancel my speech because of security and I said I'm coming anyway so tough I had to be escorted in by 20 armed police officers I had to be escorted off campus by motorcycle cops flashing their lights there were 300 students who had blocked all the entrances were physically assaulting people trying to get into the theater the police had to sneak the students in two by two into the theater they told them that until I left the campus they can let the kids out of the theater cuz they were afraid that they let the kids out of the theater that attacked as they got is they released it was that one is pretty well it's after that it's okay well I guess the Securities necessary

<timemark seconds="1157" />

what is Shifting what is what is wrapping things up out there it's this intersectionality Politics on the left that says that they're bunch of victim groups basically are there blacks and Hispanics and Asians they're all victim groups and we get those all those people together to attack the system because the system is keeping them down and if you and end of the hierarchy and if you are a straight white male you at the very very bottom of the hierarchy in terms of you points that should be acknowledged because you're the creators of the vast white supremacist system that keeps telling everybody else of your black woman your job right here at the Top If You're A white guy and you challenge the Viewpoint of a black woman your Viewpoint is an attack on her identity and therefore she has the right to shut you down and so the idea is that your words are violence to her I done today and therefore she has the right to react this is the attorney here on campus why does microaggressions that I did it my opinion microaggressions you now

<timemark seconds="1217" />

terminology I think is really stupid because normally in regular life would say that's insulting and he said to me I don't like the terminology microaggression suggest aggression like I'm actually doing something impressive to you and the rational response to someone saying you is to use physical force in response and so you start you start to see I'm more violent response I think I think there's a reactionary side on the right that's that's growing identity Politics on the left that says no black attorney politics gay identity politics politics I think you're starting to see in some areas of white identity politics that's almost formed in response like okay well if everybody else why can't we defend ourselves on the same ground I hate that shit they didn't they created quite a mess I'm sure you saw what happened Evergreen with Bret Weinstein the left is eating itself and not Progressive enough unless you're literally

<timemark seconds="1277" />

leaving your class because you're white you can't be there because your wife absence meaning the professor's the white people and then when you don't do your somehow another racist and a Nazi mean the whole thing's the whole thing was very bizarre to watch because you so much so often all over the country right now it's almost like some new flower of ridiculous thinking and behavior in Missouri with that woman I was that woman who got the video when you see her on video saying can we get some muscle over here exactly ographer photos of a public place

<timemark seconds="1337" />

you created some safe space but it's it's it's this weird thing where it's half of it is identity politics but it's also wrapped up in this need to control people and control people's behavior control their vernacular control the way they communicate and how how much you give into group think it's it's weird it it's scary and a social psychologist Albert NYU he did really good piece for the Atlantic in 2015 about this phenomenon is going to save space trigger warning phenomenon this idea that you must never be forced into a position where someone has an idea that opposes yours and what he said it's basically make people crazy makes you crazy that's the idea in Psychology is that if you have a chain of thoughts leading to a bad outcome if you're depressed thoughts leading the way that psychologists deal with that of the cognitive behavioral therapy they say okay we're in this chain of thoughts are you going wrong are you attributing to somebody a motive they don't have as your wife really being nasty or is it you just attributing nasty to her and that's why

<timemark seconds="1397" />

getting depressed or spinning off right try to control your own Chain of Thought what does is it actually offended actually an interest in being offended will give you a Ward's if you're offended get your your treasured if you're offended because it demonstrates that you're right you're the more you are offended the more we can show that you are welcome and because you are there for your this virtual you get to Lord over everyone else mess and my speeches if we could somehow identify like the LGBT half-black half-Hispanic one-quarter Native American little person you know then we would finally have the the person who we can go to dance or all of our questions because their identity would be unquestionable want to put a gender on Yoda

<timemark seconds="1457" />

no one is no one's left to know and it's in there so far left that they've actually made common cross with the people that hate rides on the talk about safe spaces and misery get all these black students protesting and actually said we don't want white people who think like us and want to help us in our safe spaces we feel insulted by that I just left the KKK agrees safe spaces for separate races I can find some Jim Crow races are totally up for that my 1962 black people and white people because they don't have any power over why people

<timemark seconds="1497" />

wow Ventures just you have to have power in the superstructure in order for you to even to be erased I can understand you being racist is not connected to racist action if you don't have the capacity for Action that affects people then your personal racism is not as important as the racism the people in power is an argument the idea that you can't be racist at all if you're if you're black because black people don't have enough. First of all the idea of the black people have no power in the United States is utterly crazy really crazy going on why was President the Attorney General was the chief of police was black the majority of the city council was black and Democrat the entire day that the deputy Attorney General of the United States

<timemark seconds="1557" />

president of the United States with butt up here in the majority of the city of Baltimore make your ideas actually work in concert with reality I can't I can't do this with you do you ever step back and look at this trend and look at what's going on in popular culture and looking what's going on with identity politics in this war between the left and the right and wonder where it's going I mean it feels like people are completely emboldened by the fact that you have this guy in office who is said things like grabbed by the pussy and he lies all the time and makes fun of people's plastic surgery you think that having this guy in in this position

<timemark seconds="1603" />

I guess in some way in Bolton's them and makes them even more convinced the factor right and you no fight but put up the resistance in the hashtag resistance hashtag resist it's all over the place where is this go I think I think what's happening in this one of the things that I personally am not a fan of it in this was all the way back to the Piers Morgan saying to you don't get to contribute intent to me that I don't have right where you're standing on the bridge I don't care enough about dead kids because I don't agree with you is that is the sweet spot where a lot of people like to live which is if we disagree on politics because you're an asshole to get to the goal or we have different goals is his you're a bad person and I think that what you're seeing is with there's an attempt to cast all of his voters as people who love all of the things that are bad that he does and says is that they voted for him because I thought Hillary Clinton was the worst president true

<timemark seconds="1663" />

vote for him because they like the ground by the p word stuff right they voted for him because they like that he's older and realize a lot they voted for him because they are bad people write this is why people think Hillary Clinton deplorable speech at the implication was okay everybody who voted for Trump is a bad human being they tried to try to catch him as Joe Biden said a guy wants to put y'all back in Chains and he said that he straps dogs on top of his car is an evil nasty guy there said there's a story in the Boston Globe about how like back in 1982 he went on a family vacation and when they're traveling you put the dog in a cage with the dog on the top of his car and this is and this was like a big campaign issue you never binders full of women

<timemark seconds="1723" />

my Administration said bring binders full of female resumes to me and I think that you see some of that on the right by things more reactionary I think that did the owner of moral superiority that the left likes the kind of wallowing and I think that's that's more on the left on the right I think that there is an attempt by some on the right now in response to it to do some of that well it becomes he's sticking points that you used when you know and it becomes something that people repeat over and over again do you know like the deplorable thing or a homophobe yeah that's just what I was walking to New York City street testing and there was this guy right next to me fucking screaming in the actual parade itself he was like on the sidewalk but he was screaming Donald Trump KKK racist sexist anti-gay but the best part about it was

<timemark seconds="1783" />

he saw black guy coming towards him and he just started screaming black lives matter black lives matter and I just want to scream black lives matter yeah it's almost like the the laziness and having the ability to communicate is one thing but having a Express a complete thought that covers something as new as complex as American politics in 2017 that's too hard so let's just yell out Donald Trump KKK and disability to like boiled down what's the difference between the left and the right to like a little statement is a bucket of deplorable cuz it's like it's so powerful

<timemark seconds="1843" />

it works you put it on the back of a bumper sticker and petting it also been changed a little bit by Stevie ever do watches movies so when we do power text to see it through the prism of House of Cards or or any of the other political movies you've ever seen and that means there's a bad guy right every but there's a bad villain in the villain has to be the villain is somebody was incompetent like usually in politics if somebody is bad sometimes they have a malevolent point of you usually it's somebody who's misguided and it's in bad ideas usually just stupid or incompetent do I keep saying the people who oppose Trump like why are you attributing to him now is when stupidity would do like you keep saying that everything Trump is doing is out of some sort of malicious genius are we watching the same film like it if you have a problem with trump it seems by the way if they if they really hate Trump as much as the power of Washington DC

<timemark seconds="1903" />

that was the president of the United State time we treated as we watch it for fun I mean right now the last week particularly with scaramucci it for fun but it's actually kind of serious business actually looking at this like for us to look at it without what's on TV tonight episode of 300 + million people it is kind of ridiculous at this point I'm but how would you go about doing that like hot what would be the best way to implement something like that to reduce the power of congress as well back to a federalist base system where localities and states have more power over over local issues in the federal government isn't that powerful because what happened basically in in the Constitutional structure

<timemark seconds="1963" />

never supposed to be anywhere near this pic right there very certain delegated powers in the Constitution of the United States that Congress has a very small post offices but the idea that they can regulate you know your toilet flushing is just that that's what I thought that was ridiculous yet you have a federal government that it's that big so Congress regulate on that but if you're in Congress the last thing I want is to be answerable for that so what you do instead as you drop big statutes right you say things like we hope but we're passing a law that says that we should fix the environment and then you kick it over to the executive branch and the executive branch by President Trump or President Obama has a bunch of executive branch agencies like the EPA actually got on your life so if you're in Congress and things go bad you say well that's not what I meant to do I told you good stuff and the bureaucrats were not elected don't have to care so basically have everyone kicking the can

<timemark seconds="2023" />

person for purposes of responsibility you know what's going to happen is if the American people just said they're sick of the federal government running all this stuff and they start actively working to elect people who want me to my son on power which is difficult I mean most people in power don't want them in my son on power seems almost impossible it seems like work so hard to get to the top of the game is going to try to shift the game so that they don't have any power in their hand on the state level for pretty jealous about their own authority of the federal government listen you're telling me to do something goes Chris I was like what do you do about it almost ready to leave for the longest time they were they were not really a state

<timemark seconds="2083" />

single store is called Lone Star Brewery or Texas that's everything is named after the state more than any place else I've ever been transplanted some sort of liberal Paradise where you could get famous for doing nothing

<timemark seconds="2113" />

Lakers Hollywood Pride there San Jose Pride but my California we have it we have a team called the Los Angeles Lakers not stick the lake in this in this take concrete Ravine river is hilarious when when I've shown people to LA River my test LA River. Shut up

<timemark seconds="2147" />

I guess the river knows it's the LA River I could just it is a lie it's a fucking concrete shity slide for water and if it's so dirty I was born in Burbank North Hollywood like this is the first time but yeah I mean it's gotten so shabby lately it's such a pollution in Mexico City to me is just like Ellie in the future but with zero respect for the traffic lights when I mean 0 I've never seen anything like it it's crazy they're very worried about getting kidnapped over there I find Mexican people to be some of the nicest people and real friendly and easy to get along with but they don't give a fuck about traffic lights when we were stuck in traffic look there's

<timemark seconds="2207" />

Bumper to Bumper in tigrinya make their way through and people hit the brakes and they make their way through the intersection to straight up and it's not just one one guy goes another guy goes behind them and then he got like 20 cars and and it just gridlocked why do United States works lights like they didn't like it it's true Italy also it's true in Israel like when I visited Israel with my wife and we got married he like no one pays attention to the traffic rules everyone is honking their horns at each other because we have a Baseline and you know the country was based on the side the other social fabric we all have respect for each other enough that we don't follow the basic rules of the game and that's true as far as traffic lights it's true as far as Financial dealings with one and

<timemark seconds="2267" />

when you lose that when you lose the basic respect for the guy who lives next to collapse generally when small rule start to go broken leg is it 50% of their economies Black Market because they have high tax rates and no one pays them you're sorry California to California is the highest taxes in the country by far the number one rated deductions so we pass all these high taxes so we can congratulate ourselves for social justice and then we avoid all the taxes as much as we possibly can you go making a freaking Fortune also feel like when you get a giant number of people smash into a small area and it includes Great Valley and it's just that there's so many of us there so damn it's it's almost like you get that sorted diffusion of responsibility thing with it's just too many people to care about and you lose this

<timemark seconds="2326" />

value that you have for fellow people I lived in Boulder for little while then when I left on your lawn like a sign for someone running for they would take it down they will literally take things down but when I was there I was amazing how many people are polite when they drive and they waive like there's only a hundred thousand people is 10 million people and then you got to count everybody's connected to all the other counties around it's not like there's some a border around that's exactly right it is in the Oklahoma Oklahoma for a radio show

<timemark seconds="2386" />

I know now that you're from La you look away right you only stabbed in call my father Isaac where am I what's going on here like this is not regular but I do think that there is something to the idea that if you have too many people into small space we're all up in each other's business so much it is very hard to get to say to people okay Liberty stay away from one another leave each other alone like yeah but he was next door and he's a jackass hate that guy cuz he's like right next to you also it's been replicated in Rat population density studies that you get more mental illness you get more aggressive behavior when they stack cubicles in that disc Jam I'm closer and closer together and that's exactly what's happening with people to it what Manhattan is famous for it I mean I enjoyed visiting Manhattan and everytime I'm there I'm always like no I can't

<timemark seconds="2446" />

I can drive if I was there last week and I like this guy so you can actually see the sky in Manhattan right now we watch next passage door and there's a shirt on sale and the shirts entire tax was after you having a half and I thought only competitive SLR that's why I think it's one of the reasons why Trump won is because he's basically just a guy from New York he's like a taxi driver from New York is really really wealthy and he does want a taxi driver from New York to do if you're really really wealthy he marries bottles and don'ts gold toilets and all this kind of stuff and people the rest of the country actually take that language seriously so when he says stuff like going to bomb the shit out of them so we do you know and people in Oklahoma like wow he's serious but not actually going to happen and probably not probably that's just how people for me to talk

<timemark seconds="2506" />

weather for the entire meeting. How dare he's talking about how cops and rough people up listen is it appropriate for the president of the United States to talk like that about treatment of suspect know is it are we supposed to eat the super seriously like this is like how to change with regard to what he does he works the room the other reality TV star he's a real image guy I can put Trump on the side of his hotels great that's why I'm kind of shocked that is kind of crappy

<timemark seconds="2566" />

I hate that was going to come his way and I think he's such an ego Maniac he has a hard time dealing with it and it's a hard time separating and that's one of things that I've read about him that he's getting better at getting away from the comment and not reading comments on Twitter but you fucking blocks people you know about that look like being able to block citizens that ended up having their own opinion about what the first doing or not doing so then you have to say what are you allowed to be how far does that go I mean what are you allowed to say I mean I need is you to be able to whatever the hell you want about anybody but if you can't threaten on the planet are you busy blocking people on Twitter at 3 in the morning like to get on Scarborough Mika Brzezinski

<timemark seconds="2626" />

he sang she showed up with bloody scars or she was bleeding from her recent facelift exactly and it did it first of all it turns out they're probably wasn't true but goes out when you're bleeding I agree with you I agree with you but it's but this National Review about this hatred directed towards Trump is warping truck I think that it's also wore some people on my side of the aisle who are who are so interested in the fight that there wasn't written advancing the policies that I'd like to see a cheap sew and Mike Pence becomes president and then proceeds to do all the things conservatives wanted to give you know your tax reform and we do all of these things is not tweet about Mika brzezinski's bloody face I think there's a couple people and I will be pissed what exactly what they want is somebody who pisses off the left more than beats the left

<timemark seconds="2686" />

I didn't Obama sort of trolled some of the right into Insanity a lot of people on our side where is like this jerk he just he keeps saying things just to piss us off and Obama did you some of that in order for all in the same thing or like yeah that's awesome 2 days ago or yesterday there's a report that Trump said that he thinks the White House is shabby my entire life is Obama said that we would not let him forget that for 1,000 years did the White House and she happy I'm in people's house is a mansion building on the face of the planet and white house too shabby and and their people in the right for like fine it's funny like you know at least rolling the left at least it's taking them off and say guys taking off the left is not a substitute for defeating the left if you actually care about the feeding the left

<timemark seconds="2746" />

I just want to thank the drives me nuts because my my life goal has been to promulgate particular ideas not just to piss off the left but I think that in the fight there a lot of people who fall into the Trap of thinking these two things are done right because I have to let that means you're winning cuz I know pissing up a lot maybe part of it but that's not how you win you win by saying things that are true and if they get pissed I get pissed about Obama back when Obama was mocking Trump and saying the one thing that I am depressed stage and you see Trump of the audience boiling with see no big frog double chin just sitting there eating it all and that fucking stuck in his craw that there's there's a whole story BuzzFeed about his interaction of a kind of McKay coppins reporter for BuzzFeed in which McKay was basically like saying to Trump like your joke and I'm going to run I think from Brand just it just because he was sick of people telling

<timemark seconds="2806" />

and that he wasn't going to be pricey that's half of what drives him that doesn't mean that he can't because he was willing to keep the mood I'm in the mood she's in the bushes on the ousted because of John Kelly and the mooch's is it that's exactly right about him performing at it it doesn't matter just the idea that he would you must be emboldened by the fact that I said so many outrageous things that there's so much blow back that he had to replace Kelly and Kelly in there until he's like you can't do this

<timemark seconds="2866" />

I'm saying I don't say that again but at the same time remember this is the same week that Trump himself he's tweeting out that Attorney General Sessions who is his most loyal supporter for a year-and-a-half that that guy is like a traitor and that he wishes he go away cuz you work using self player any of these people at any time like this is very passive aggressive for a guy who made his living saying you're fired on TV it's amazing that all the people that Trump has fired have been fired actually through surrogate I James Comey was fired basically through Rod Rosenstein and sessions and then Rosenstein Television TV try and give him a letter and like everyone has to be fired in the most

<timemark seconds="2926" />

I think I think the Attic Kennewick Kennewick when he's not there and I can make a phone call Firearms hang up the phone have to actually see the guy because it was like oh you can do that like this this guy is looking into improprieties and you can just say no you can't do that anymore you're fired you can't look into things I've done wrong it was a walk the way he did it was the stupid part so I was calling for coming to be fired since last year I thought the way he handled the whole hell or anything from beginning. It was terrible I thought the trumpster to replace them before he became as basically Dave one here's my new cabinet, you did a great job you know I sure about the door and somebody knew he kept him around and then the person he said that, you remember was when he met him he said you're more famous than I am well when Trump says that to you

<timemark seconds="2986" />

what's the writing on the wall right there was also a part of the problem was a giant yeah it's which way did you join the wild our way I'm going to be pissed when Comey was handling the email what specifically did you not like about what I thought it was crazy was when he started to reopen the case because of her having used her cleaners Earth and all that stuff like that's not enough to me seems like

<timemark seconds="3046" />

add Mike Baker on from the CIA and he said essentially anyone else would be in jail for what she did her for sure he said publicly we're not going to prosecute Hillary Clinton he was doing something he didn't have the authority to do the FBI does not decide whether to prosecute people they were for the information to the doj and then the general Loretta Lynch's decision whether or not you have intent to commit Espionage to make classified Secrets public or expose them to the possibility of being made public intents is not an element of the crime right if you do it it's a crime to my wife as it dies your doctor and that means that she is under HIPAA requirements there's no elements under HIPAA it says that if she reveals somebody's proprietary medical information by accident was no intent so she's okay that's not part of the statute if she brings him his medical records at her car and somebody steals my medical records

<timemark seconds="3106" />

you know she's working at the VA or something that's a crime it doesn't matter if she intended to do it just left it in her purse so call me read the element of intent into the crime to get Hillary off and then he said okay we're not going to prosecute this going to leave it alone in the first place is basically for why she should be prosecuted and then at the end he goes but no we're not going to do that he also said we're going to keep us updated on any future development well and there's a future development they found his laptop with all sorts of information on it with new emails from Hillary Clinton's they haven't seen before and now he has an obligation to inform Congress cuz you told them that you would and so he screwed the pooch again because he's afraid that if he doesn't reveal that information Hillary goes on to win and then it comes out there something criminal then people going to blame him for Hillary winning and I'll be fully transparent I have to honor my institution I'm going to put this out there of course than Hillary loses and now he screwed up twice and then he gets into the White House and now he's supposed to be investigating the Trump Russia stuff

<timemark seconds="3166" />

now he's investigating basically both candidates in the 2016 election he handled this the wrong way every step of the way because he was so focused on what will uphold the end of the Integrity of the FBI and the Integrity of the investigations in the Integrity of the doj so in a sense Trump was right in saying that he's a grandstander the firing of Comey is the two days after he fired Comey he went to Western on NBC they said the reason I fired, it was not all the excuses I gave about the the Hillary stuff it's cuz of the Russia stuff in Russia

<timemark seconds="3212" />

I mean that's really stupid but it's also strange that it didn't go anywhere right like that was it like that that's against the law. Struction looking at the statutes obstruction is a little bit more than that so you have to actually UPS truck an ongoing investigation into criminal activity there's a counterintelligence investigation going on early criminal one specific about it but it specifically governs something like this plus it is true that Trump does have the power as the chief executive to fire as a matter to fire the FBI director for any reason he chooses now all that said he can be impeached for any reason for me to learn on criminal rating peachment is not a you don't actually have to admit it

<timemark seconds="3272" />

how can I have to vote to impeach you and then there's the Sun and have to go by two-thirds majority or 60 yeah me too actually convict you of a set of crimes they come up with but these are all political definition of high crimes and misdemeanors it doesn't mean they actually have to prosecute you like it when a criminal court and you have to go to jail or any of that kind of stuff like anybody at any time even have to commit perjury if they want if they wanted to get that way every President Buchanan Beach it's just about it's just about so all the talk about what's criminal and what's not personal the problem for Trump there two ways of reading Trump behavior in the hole Russia thing right way one is he's got something to hide most obvious way he's got something to hide that's why you get for the Flint we don't know what he got rid of Flynn he gets her to call me we don't really know why you got me to call me and then back to the Russians that it's a pressure off and on the Russia stuff away when is he's hiding something and now he's firing everybody gets in the way and there's you know the chain of evidence doesn't not fit that in order our attorney General Sessions the deputy

<timemark seconds="3332" />

General Rod Rosenstein the former head of the FBI James Comey the acting head of the FBI McCabe and and the special prosecutor right Robert Mueller so those are all people involved the free at so there's something to be said for the idea that may be trying to hide something on the other hand we haven't actually seen any hard evidence of collusion it's else we saw an attempt to collude by Donald Trump jr. We haven't actually seen any evidence that the Russians were providing special information to the Trump Administration which was bending weaponize for using the campaign we haven't seen any that stuff so personality he's so Patty and he wants to be loved so much that he is angry that people keep saying he run because he won because of the Russians and so now every time people say that he just got pissed and he fires people so call me call me comes to him and he said privately that you are not under investigation and trim system well why didn't you say that and I can't say that cuz if I say that

<timemark seconds="3392" />

Congress if you do fall under investigation and Trump doesn't like that he wants to know he's free and clear Rite Aid so there's two ways to read that either he's totally innocent but stupid or he's trying to hide something those are the only two possible ways of reading the situation but Donald Trump jr. thing was really bizarre because he released all the email I just got nothing to hide like you aren't supposed to do any of these things you're saying in these emails then you hear that he was coached by his dad again none of this is good stuff releasing the email it is imperative to Note 8 minutes later than your X released basically the email

<timemark seconds="3452" />

Alex works now is your smartest move if there's dirt about you is to be the first person out the gate with it and you put a spin on it right so like Barack Obama imagine if Obama hadn't said anything in 2008 in the week before the election that he did Coke in high school now a lot of people wouldn't care a lot of people would write in 2000 George W Bush was hit with a DUI charge with 1973 and it is probably lost him a point in the polls so what about that is right in the middle of stuff you have to put a spin on it from you didn't you just put out the emails and email from the cells contain the damming material is right in their lawyer the Russian government sees this as part of its effort to Aid mr. Trump's campaign and Donald jr. thumbs-up sounds all right that does not look good it's not quite as much as your people on what you want to say it is me that there's no

<timemark seconds="3512" />

no evidence yet that any information was actually exchange with the Russians or that anything came of the meeting most of people to meeting with said some things and nothing came of it you know considering every major campaign figure was there but he but they just keep lying and this is this the part that's probably the problem are they lying because they just think they can get away with it in their stupid or they lying because they're actually being meticulous about that a wise I tend to think the former because this isn't a professional Administration I think he's heading from a lot he says things that he says things like the leader of the Boy Scouts called me and told me that he loved my Facebook and I think it's just so used to putting that that spin on things that publicity publicity spend the right and the thing that he said about this was at this is what politics is what happens in politics

<timemark seconds="3572" />

dirt about your enemy and it people exchange information since what happened it's just you're seeing it now so loud but some of the stuff is not usual but it's actually not particularly usual to meet with it a government that is really not friendly to the United States to receive information about your political opponent but if you watch House of Cards you think it's like you stepped down from throwing somebody under the subway so what's the big deal I work in politics when I go home at night the last thing I want to do is watch dogs a great show but if it's like I always wonder the thing the thing that gets me is when people suicide themselves that are on our way to try. I don't want to be that guy but how many people are going to Suicide themselves for sure someone's been murdered somewhere along the line someone do something so powerful

<timemark seconds="3632" />

got to them and they murdered them how it's going to happen it has happened must have happened I think it happens a lot in Russia I don't think I don't believe what Trump said any vision of what politics is because he thinks that the outer limit of politics is Russia he thinks anything inside that limit is now okay I can't name a specific example of where it has I think that are you open to the possibility I don't think I don't think anybody but Hillary I don't think if I had my last thousand bucks

<timemark seconds="3674" />

I'd be super tempted to bet on black and be super tempted to go you know what I think she went dark Whitewater I want to see Vince Foster I want to see that Enron guy who shot himself in the head twice to see if I could really you know man I think it's happened I just don't know who should have went if I don't know when I'm hesitant it everyday I see Trump on TV saying like America hasn't killed people inside what is journalistic so I'm pretty sure that wasn't trying to kill Chris Wallace

<timemark seconds="3732" />

what food is obviously the extreme example write up blobs with extreme example is North Korea but Putin is in that range of essentially a dictator whose on in Turkey your shipping this is very reason why America is 8 liters in France have people regularly whacked I don't think regularly but I think every now and then the move is a possibility but I don't think it's a regular thing if you think I did not like a rare thing and maybe once in awhile you know once every 20 years and we gets whacked quietly for political reasons if you think I took a regular thing then fibbing is like way inside the line right right

<timemark seconds="3792" />

is really what were you like writing your son's stupid statement about a stupid Email exchange and then feeling about it publicly like that's really inside the lines again I don't think that I think I'm going to have a rule about the Trump Administration I never attribute malevolence when I contribute to stupid it because I think that that's more likely to be the case like the Occam's razor but I think sometimes malevolence is real Chandra Levy thing turned up. And then 9/11 happened right away afterwards so people kind of forgot about it but they they found her body in the park and everybody was like Jesus Christ like this is a woman that was about to testify that she was having an affair with this guy and that one was a good one good one obviously

<timemark seconds="3852" />

if I'm more into the personal than the political political Vendetta against this guy wasn't Teddy Kennedy left a woman in the back of his car and a body of water so drunk driving right that was the thing with him he just didn't want to be responsible for something horrible that he did not meeting with the police to collect something like 18 hours every shot in the face I would imagine control that one out so yeah but it made my God she said but yet when you leave somebody under water for 12 hours they tend to do that it's weird how that works

<timemark seconds="3912" />

crash my car to the bank go to somebody's house come back like a day later there was a girl in the backseat I've never had it happen but I have had 5 had what I would call slideshow nights if you know where I get hammered and then like a wake up this morning with a pounding headache and I just is have these flashes in my head like who is that person I'd where was I where were we oh yeah she's completely forgot about it but I forgot a lot of it but some people I have a friend and he goes gerbil eyes there's a switch that goes off three or four shots in and he he's gone and he's not there anymore and you almost got to like Nerf the world around him protecting me

<timemark seconds="3972" />

thing doesn't know a thing about what happened it's really bizarre it's just let horrible things happen but the stories are legendary but he does he gets shark eyes get these black like soulless eyes where he's gone and you got all know he's gone yeah it's weird I wonder what that is I feel like that's a neurological issue I feel like if you if alcohol does that to this probably some switches that aren't connected right in the head so Teddy Kennedy when he was obviously a raging alcoholic and that could have been a part of the problem I mean literally might have gone home not even knowing that he killed somebody minute Applebee's damages only to find imagine well that was one of the things that they said that they would have used as a defense again with OJ that OJ with the CTE that he

<timemark seconds="4032" />

what he was doing when he might have flown into some black outrage about the twinkie defense right but there are people that think that you know is you're going to see more and more things like that out of former NFL players with massive brain trauma issues NFL player Devon Hall accused of killing his mother he doesn't remember the mean of insanity defense

<timemark seconds="4092" />

but it should be in jail for that not not really into that cases where people are like sleep-walking and they think that in the dreaming at the same time so I think that their wife is actually like this defense is been used where they think they're the wife is super monster in the room snake-like love her to death and then they wake up and I owe that was my wife really creative defense or it's true the brain traumas a real issue the two of them together I mean there's something about getting knocked around in the head where it's so completely unpredictable and then you add in this impulsive nature of behavior that happens if something really weird about brain trauma it causes a lot of very strange impulsive behavior in people they really can't understand even why they're behaving the way they're behaving just not good obviously is way off track

<timemark seconds="4152" />

pictures of the CTE study was a hundred and eleven players and 110 of them had CTE Punch-Drunk since we'll see the thing is when you get to that when you get to the slurring your words part You're So Gone like you're already gone there's a lot of people that have CTE that speak really well and they're very articulate and they're very reasonable and you wouldn't even understand they're dealing with all these this host of neurological issues by the time you're not in the wrong but by the time your voice is slurring and you're dealing with like real heavy duty symptoms like you're fucked like you're So Gone like you're you you're you're way off the deep a question for you I'm in what would you do about

<timemark seconds="4212" />

the factor I think there's a there's two things going on there's the fuck it factor or people like I don't care I want to watch people get their ass kicked. It's fun it's exciting people love it and it's signing up for when they do with another consequences of it and it's worth of Glory to be the guy who delivers it versus the guy who receives it so I think there's that but then there's also look like the Colin Kaepernick saying I think that probably cost a lot of ratings for the NFL that 12% said that the Kaepernick national anthem thing was the reason this is 72% of black people thought it was great and like an equal percentage of white people thought that it was just terrible which is it which is a fascinating look at that sort of how race relations working

<timemark seconds="4272" />

country LR one of the reasons I think that piece of mine and every time I turn on ESPN after lecture about Caitlyn Jenner or about black lives matter shut up ugly relevant since before I was born in 1984 when they did it for ESPN and I don't know if this is true or not but the word was that he had her getting athlete of the Year whatever the award was the arrow

<timemark seconds="4309" />

directly tied to the exclusive interview with Diane Sawyer come on let's go figure out where you are from she's a fucking Kardashian okay yeah I not put the video where they circled her house and she was like moving in the shadows behind the drapes did you ever say that no

<timemark seconds="4343" />

wonderful she was like the first time she was revealing herself out of this woman so they're circling her house is Gloria's house in like it looks like it's in Malibu or somewhere but they're circling the house and it's in the hills with helicopter looks filming he's like the fucking high production value shit this isn't just like you know we met with Caitlin and Caitlin back the former Navy SEAL you know that you just sits down and then she starts talking she said she got surgery but it doesn't make me any I was it wasn't that guy was any less of a man or less of a woman before the surgery well this is the case about gender write a surgery that was like a lot of questions

<timemark seconds="4403" />

call Caitlyn Jenner Caitlyn Jenner is a biological man I wish I could be a good amount do the number one retweeted tweet I've ever had had a hundred and a day ago and has a hundred and twenty thousand likes and it's it was there was a headline from CNN it said transgender man gives birth to an assigned the female sex at Birth gives birth to a healthy baby boy and woman gives birth to boy that's not a headline I'm sorry because the woman believe she's the man doesn't exist sex still exist in who feels like a man that's fine if you want to say that that I use

<timemark seconds="4463" />

just throw biology out the window I don't understand why that's any better than a religious person saying every time you say something you have to mention God I don't have the right to be fascinated by the transgender the exact date

<timemark seconds="4488" />

it's compulsory and it's rabid so I think there's a couple of things that are going on one is that it is very dark but I think that there is an element of like this is different and we get to it we get to Revel in the in the weirdness of it but we're going to pretend that it's all about the Civil Rights of it really going to feel like special because we're on their side and Caitlyn Jenner because it's a curiosity and cuz it's weird because we're on Caitlyn generous I really feel very good about Roman like there's something about reports of some trans soldier in the Roman army in a thousand years ago it's got to be exist now and it's existed before was popular

<timemark seconds="4548" />

it's a condition I mean a lot of people's mind is labeling it somehow I negative I mean it is highly link to suicidality this 40% lifetime suicide rate for people who have this particular gender disorder that seems to be not to be like Brit weather in algae is this is something I'm not willing to do I think that actually damaging the kids for take a little more than willing to call her she and chain but you can always change your name once Emily call Caitlyn Jenner Caitlyn Caitlyn Jenner penis

<timemark seconds="4608" />

and it and let you know in a tragic accident it would make him and if he were born with high doses of estrogen in his bloodstream woman the natural status of the biological status but this nonsense that if you Joe Rogan decide tomorrow that you are a woman no surgeries no homo no homo nothing you just tomorrow you wake up and not the side but you feel like a woman then you have always been a woman we must treat you as a woman you don't have to change anything about yourself for us to even determine whether you're wanting we just know I'm sorry no I mean but I had a mental illness grandfather I got I got so much for this again the rate of suicide and depression are astounding my grandfather was it was a bipolar schizophrenic and it would have not been good for him or my family if people had said to him Nate you're right

<timemark seconds="4668" />

the radio is talking to you that you're right the curtains are talking to you that they put in a mental hospital to give him with him and then he was better than you could actually live a normal relatively happy life there's no good treatment for gender identity disorder gender dysphoria whatever you wanna call it but to suggest that it isn't the condition that doesn't require treatment they really it's just that you're actually brain female again this is a scientific there's no scientific evidence that even these studies that have been done talking about there's a female brain in the male brain first of all if you say this to a feminist you're a sexist right right if you say to a feminist there's a female and male brain and my brain works differently than the female brain come you're so lucky like how dare you allowed to celebrate classic definitions of female Beauty short skirt this is like not listen

<timemark seconds="4728" />

haircut and dress like Billie Jean King love Laverne Cox transgender woman from Orange is the New Black I never watch that I never watch that show where the girl the girl that's okay but I always wondered America's next civil rights Fighters gay marriage or the Civil Rights Fighters transgender there was only one real civil rights by news about black people who have been historically oppressed in the United States for 200 years

<timemark seconds="4788" />

this is correct experience as being incredibly wealthy and it's in a in a high net-worth suburb areas of American like I'm sure that's true but it's also like behavior is not the same as being born black or being born Asian or being born with disabled if I'm a business owner and I hire you and your man and you come in the next day and you're dressed in in a woman's clothing saying your woman but you still have a full beard like I don't see why is a business owner I'm expected to eat the cost of that like I just said that it seems that seems bizarre to me the cost is a great way to phrase it I didn't I didn't I was completely open in Liberal about it until there was a case where a man would demand for 30 years became a woman for a little less than 2 years and then started MMA fighting women

<timemark seconds="4848" />

out of these women and shot her and not proclaiming that he or she used to be a man because what is in quote it was a medical condition that I did not need to disclose I guess what I'm fucking medical condition right and if you ever watch the fights it was horrible to say but again it's it's so funny how the transgender movement destroys the feminist movement by living off of the the sort of like the feminist movement promulgate is the feminist movement said stupid things like women and men equally athletic profession and it's all social absolute back. And it's particularly true with regard to actual physical capacity this is just nonsense

<timemark seconds="4908" />

what's wrong like a girl running like a girl commercial saying what is it to be running like a girl no Trona adult woman and she be running on early in the day but your little girl and she's running a little girly but she's running a fever since it's only society that has forced little girls run like one person I have a 3 year old girl throws like a girl second of all right but she play with dolls because you're a sexist pig trucks like in the first year and I will always be a girl but if she likes trucks or whether you like that was an issue with one of my daughters to my daughter was a little worried about Argo she she's like no you not care and she's like me then she turned the corner and then we just let her be whatever she's like Batman for a while

<timemark seconds="4968" />

set the left kept saying you want to meet my wife right who's who's a conservative and I made him working so good we got married to that's what men tend to do they were there weather-wise but she but she really had a conversation about this and I said women don't throw like men and she got like all offended and I said but that's actually treated right but it's but it's insulting is like no that's actually true like I'm sorry there been studies out of a thousand it if you took a woman throwing a baseball baseball the woman will throw faster than a thousand men is in the book The Sports Gene the one will throw faster than two of those men out of a thousand about the Goose Gossage here we're talking about like that found Fox used was that she actually lost to a woman she lost a woman named Ashlee evans-smith but what I said was no this proves my point is that you're not good you're just a man

<timemark seconds="5028" />

John Mcenroe got slapped all over the lot when he said about Serena Williams she's right but it's like if you were a man she get her ass kicked and everyone's like know how dare you carry something called the universal tennis ranking in the mid ranks of college male players if you were mad and Serena Williams at like 5 years ago there was a 200 rank man in the world when she wanted to just warm up with and they played it like just a normal match for a friend who said he was like rank 200 in the world and the only shock was that he dropped it I dropped a point to her will there was the issue of Renee Richards when Renee Richard started playing tennis against women and kicking their ass and he was a middling player as best as a woman or as a man rather but as a woman he was a fucking killer

<timemark seconds="5088" />

women are so great that even though we decide to be women we're better than women I was excited to be in women than women glossing over the the difference between feminist have been claiming that women are distinct from men and important and different and better in certain I don't understand because female president Donald Trump last week of the election of trump. He's going to lose you should have just declared himself a woman president

call Matt and I'm the best looking man argument so many people calling me a big because it was stunning because it was a logical woman like you these biological women at least two of them got the fuck beating out of them but I found Fox before they found out that she used to be a man I'm like that's not an issue to these people and so this one woman said she's always been a woman and I said okay she gave birth she impregnated a woman and got her pregnant I go what about then she was even then went with her dick and getting that woman pregnant like we are in Fantasyland it's it's it's crazy town

<timemark seconds="5191" />

I just decided some of the big it like you were in a weird area were talking about structure and here's the crazy thing is that they always will lie on these gender reassignment doctors to define the terms and it's really interesting because I got deep deep deep into the rabbit hole with this cuz I was really shocked at how many people were angry at me and there is one Doctor Who is a board-certified endocrinologist who should have broke it down just like not always the science behind this crazy but when you have gender reassignment surgery one of the big issues with men transitioning into women is bone density who she's like when you have gender reassignment surgery you're taking estrogen which actually preserves bone density she's like not only do they have less bone density because it did your preserving it like it's not your not I'm going to automatically be just like a woman in a year so I don't think Sergeant I mean I know too much about doctoring from having spent 1000 years

<timemark seconds="5251" />

my wife's medical education to believe the doctors have the capacity to magically change a man into a woman know maybe it's going to happen but no this is fifth grade science people isn't it great science what scares the shit out of me is when you hear the stories about people deciding if their child was like 8 or 9 years old is scared because you about the Ruby Rose girl that she was saying that when she was young when she was a teenager she wanted to be a man she wanted to be transgender and that she had gone through that phase now she's so happy that you didn't do anything right percent of kids who experience any sort of gender dysphoria as children grow out of it so when you have a society that reinforces it and then in Canada they're not having the passing laws now that say that if a kid says give a girl

<timemark seconds="5311" />

and the girl says I'm a boy and she's three but the government can come in your house and take the kids because obviously it if use if you don't want to hear the kid and get the kid treatment or surgery or hormone blockers then you're obviously doing something wrong to the kids this is just it's insane if anyone tried to do that I mean it at that kind of stuff where you're talkin legit Civil War like one because the government knows better than you how to parent your kids on basic things like are you a boy or a girl that that's going to buy them pretty quickly if you send someone with a gun saying I'm taking your daughter from you because your daughter says she's a boy at school and you and you're not going to take her to a psychiatrist to start her transitioning process know so far down the rabbit hole of insanity is a personal choice of a 60 year old man like Bruce Jenner who decides he wants to be a woman about it have a good time but how did we get so crazy that that becomes an

<timemark seconds="5371" />

watching that people aren't did not pay attention to the the the massive variables that a child encounters psychological variables stress variables what's going on what's Happening is happening to you and how how can you decide this is it you get you can allow this kid to make a like a lockdown decision to begin gender transition surgery at like 9 or 10 years old girl was like 13 who used to be able to see her act and talk and how could you imagine this isn't a girl okay I don't you know I don't know I don't I don't I don't I just don't know what happened to go with the fact there's a y chromosome in every cell of that person's body except ironically for some of his sperm cells to tell me that that's probably a boy and and yes you can block the manifestation of some physical characteristics such as

<timemark seconds="5431" />

change the chromosomes and there are legitimately happened differently Klinefelter syndrome no answers now and it said that that's not biologically correct and you're not doing any sort of service to a child especially evidence was no service to a child by bringing back by humoring what is obviously a mental condition and a mental condition by the way again link to 40% lifetime suicide rate is higher than any of the population on planet Earth minute telling kids that we are going to force you into it like you express on your V that you think you're the opposite sex and now at 8 we're going to transition you into this in your suicide rate is exactly the same as we wouldn't do that Ray was very similar to come you didn't do that and then you wait like this is somehow supposed to benefit the person it's just for sure

<timemark seconds="5491" />

doesn't experience gender dysphoria I liked it when when someone's got some sort of an issue whatever it is what it is called an issue or a conditioner I try to be as standoffish I try to be as objective I tried to be as as kind as possible this is a weird one though this is a weird one because it's a it's become some sort of a fad and any criticism of it whatsoever even discussion of it you are labels at as a transphobic piece of shit weird sexual politics because it weird to talk about anorexia which of the following body dysphoria alright or if we were to talk about him in there actually somebody identity Integrity disorder right where people like want to lose an arm and we will be saying well the problem is in the brightness on your arm like chopping off your arms seems a little extreme but if you want to do that like go ahead but if you are a kid and it's in 5 year old wins at all of his entire life I was just from now

<timemark seconds="5551" />

their arm from developing like this is not the entire society that this is a positive good is is a whole nother thing it's one thing to try and treat people who have the disorder humanely is nothing to read to find terms of the entire civilization as well as biology in order to fit that this is its value in the subjective over the object of science is objective your feelings about who you are is subjective you can have those feelings but once you are trying to translate those feelings into the objective standard we almost all by now you're approaching on my territory it's not just as much as you do what you want to do anymore you're telling me what I have to do it a different thing there is 40% suicide rate amongst transgender people I'm one of the argument that I've heard it is it's because you're not accepted and loved for their true self. And it would be just like everybody else but then I have seen no evidence to suggest that there is a decrease based on treatment than its marginal at best

<timemark seconds="5611" />

but that just for you it's is it uniform like I would like to know Michael is gender dysphoria is it in a semi percentile as anorexia or what bodybuilders cat or with strippers get when you get Triple left it's a yoga class hits anorexic and it's so disturbing being forced to redefine basic biological terminology then like it being adult like look like live with us and I'm happy to treat you with what I would hire transgender person but I'm not going to say I'm not going to change what reality is in order to humor you like if you call yourself Napoleon I'm not going to call you in a pony or not

<timemark seconds="5671" />

taking into consideration now I mean when you were looking at the other job and someone else was equal to the job but not transgender would you lean towards the not transgender person and the person they're dealing with the host of psychological issues obviously I think that you would have to think about you know typical aspects of reliability just the same way you would with any other mental disorder if you knew somebody was manic-depressive which is super common and you have somebody who is equally qualified not manic depressive you might think well that might have an effect on and how they do their job so maybe I mean personal experience with transgender people to know whether it would impact a secretarial job or something probably not probably not but it's it but again she pretended like transgenders in military this seems to me like in a decision should be made my military people actually have to determine how much does this impact the job and if you already have a group of people with a 40% suicide rate who have high levels of in higher levels of instabilities a group not individuals group and you're choosing which

<timemark seconds="5731" />

routes to pick from to be on the front lines in small units living under severe pressure for months at a time like is that something to eat is that what you're going to go for or is that something like you have to overcome certain presumptions in order to get there I tweeted something to Kristin Beck wrote the other day but when the military ban the military should be recruiting transgender people because I think that the military has hurt like it it creates a bunch of questions not just questions about who showers at home but also questions like you have a transgender man have to fill the female standards of Fitness does it how does it work with troop cohesion

<timemark seconds="5791" />

I like how does that work exactly what does the cost of gender transition surgery and hormones and psychologist like does that come into play at all here would you recruit from the anorexic Community for the military but these are like real question but that said that's why they commission to study from General mad I said that Department of Defense he was going to look into all of this and then give report and 6 months in Trump Resort we did it out there I agree that I think the trumps General is General attitude on it is probably correct in terms of what the military is there doing what what it's not there to do but what I don't agree with this how we did it at all because disrespectful to the people in it was her who are going to find out in a tweet I want to go to rationale then to tweets and then we're back to and then go back to you know like look like good be pretty hypocritical of me to say what's perfectly respectable to say into tweets you're out because that's the way it is without any sort of supporting documentation and he didn't actually Implement policy didn't give the policy to the defense department

<timemark seconds="5851" />

the Pentagon says they're not implementing a policy so the pr thing either that or he just felt like tweeting and I think that's what it was me he wanted to shift the conversation and it was The Funniest tweets in the first half of the Tweet was in consultation with my Generals in the military experts you decide that we will no longer accept ellipses a bunch of people in the Pentagon and a bunch of people depending are like during that time I didn't know whether we were going to nuclear war what was that first missile test programs up good good policy done the wrong way is actually counterproductive

<timemark seconds="5911" />

the policies and I want to see none like I want it laid out by Mattis I'm going to lay down by the fence Department I want all the reasons laid out so we can have a good discussion over it I don't really want just like thought vomit on Twitter that's just not only defective also seems that this issue is such a hot issue and it's also an issue that you're not really allowed to have an opinion on other than the standard opinion of this is always been a woman trapped in this is the way it is and I like to see the man's penis now bisnow is escaping the Ghostbusters like

<timemark seconds="5953" />

if you seen the man in England was it in England now is Germany the man identifies a 6 year old girl 6 year old girl is a clip of me that's going around the internet Affair between Antonio College girl about this and she's saying like men or men can be women with me man I said well how old are you I love that quote it seems like baffled like what and then finally hits her and it's like well you know we can't even come up with common definition of basic things about them conversations with each other because aside when a man is a woman is or whether or scientific fact. To be relevant or not after not before and now it's like the subjective is just eating everything if I don't think it's a scientific fact it's no longer scientific fact I don't rush I want the freedom to be

<timemark seconds="6013" />

and again my business or how I raise my child or you're suggesting that is my duty to Huber your authentic self to do stupid crap their entire lives not my job to humor myself but I've never done drugs and I think the drugs are stupid you know that don't tell me that I have to like cheer when somebody smokes a joint like do what you want but don't tell me that I have to redefine what I think is good and bad behavior I got silly that doesn't make any sense and the only thing that you became his weird political Hotpoint where were talking about bathrooms the argument of that I like this what about my children my children if you want a bathroom in a man with a dress is going to come in he's going to identify as a woman and it got to the point where so many people

<timemark seconds="6073" />

what about it that people are boycotting South Carolina member that was the NCAA saying they're going to remove the final four from North Carolina bathroom bill right in North Carolina and I asked online okay so when are you going to abolish the separate male and female divisions of the NC double A

<timemark seconds="6091" />

I can eat you said that we can separate male and female bathrooms where biological males play and you know where the bathroom and biological phenotype another so why you have separate divisions why you haven't why do NCAA Women's Division in the NCAA men's division where does this go I mean eventually eventually eventually it goes to one place or another like either we just say this is a step too far I give me a break you don't sign says no or we say anyone can be anything and anytime my man is a woman and a woman is a man and you know it's in just back I have seen those videos those videos are fascinating they wake up one day and their woman and the next day there a man and sat there was a guy on NPR Radiolab on the podcast who transitions at times of stress in the middle of having conversation I just switched I'm Paul now I'm a man

<timemark seconds="6151" />

if you stressed at work and switching to a woman and started crying at work so there's been this this this weird push in parts of the trans Community to suggest that a male who doesn't want to have sex with a biological male who says he's a female is it is now a sexist against women is a transphobe right you're bad person if you're a man who doesn't want to have sex with a man about a logical man and does make a gay to do that right if you have sex the biological man says a woman that's straight sex but if you were to have sex with a biological woman who says she's a man you're gay

<timemark seconds="6192" />

yeah kinda weird but I have seen the arguments in the blog posts in the tweets about men who discriminate against trans women do not want to keep saying well it's culturally defined like no that's all that Aleutian correct to have sex with women like I'm sorry to break it to everybody but evolution relies on human reproduction hey if you put that thing in the wrong place and they can reproduce like that's just sorry I've been driving for Science and then they say that my party is the party of non-science what but I'm anti-science I'm just wildly confused will the whole thing is wildly confusing but it's just such a strange subject it's such a strange subject it's been brought to the Forefront it's about more of the moral posturing and it is about people who actually think this is a major issue

<timemark seconds="6252" />

you're absolutely right and I think people love to be virtuous still have to be on that side they looked a virtue signal Alighieri you but they don't really have a lot of fake dicks they don't really go that far they just sort of take testosterone and see what's up but it's just it's a weird facet of our society today that is unexpected me and you go back 20 30 years and it was an oddity and you know even do it during the Renee Richards thing was it was more of an oddity than anything and I think a lot of people who purchase signaling are still treating it as an oddity they just won't admit that I think that they're watching it because it's a circus to them and I think it's actually cruel I don't think that you should like put people who suffer from mental illness on the cover of magazines I just don't think that's bad strategy what about bodybuilders

<timemark seconds="6303" />

I don't know if I'll be honest I don't know much about bodybuilding the argument about suffer from it as well as it in order to get that big you almost have to have some sort of a body dysmorphia to have to not understand how insanely huge you are there are which makes sense to me but I've heard people say that it's it's like we're almost like a reverse anorexia like they never feel like they're big enough hey I've seen that peanut set up before you human mind is suspect subjects are transitioning for sure for sure in everything including fashion just now

<timemark seconds="6363" />

questions about the word chiseled this is this is the new trend going to be here anymore and it so if people are susceptible to even that with regard to fashion like people will you first for five years people convince themselves that skinny jeans were thing I didn't know that they tried and people like no not this one platforms platform shoes that that that's why I'm just keep it around on my dad's will close cuz eventually they're going to come back in again you never know idea of fashion and culture also being like the same sort of mechanism that allows people to be variable when it comes to

<timemark seconds="6423" />

gender know that that's it there's a study study in Britain or Poland Britain about sexual orientation and what I found was 95% of people over the age of 60 identified as a heterosexual people who are under the age of 30 only 42% identified as exclusively heterosexual generation it's not that half the population became bisexual right that is not a scientific thing I mean the people are open to suggestion rather sexual behavior which you would assume that this goes against the whole you're born this way aspect of the view in the homosexual rights movement that says oh you were born this way but like I agree that there's a genetic component to sexual behavior but the idea that that's what why 50% of the UK population has shifted toward you know I'm open to anything so that's it

<timemark seconds="6483" />

say that I suppose you're on the Spectrum but not exclusively hers I only talk to women or drunk temperature in about like in the future there's going to be a point where guys are considered gay if they won't kiss another dude show me you're not gay but there's also this thing that I think happens when you have two very clear sides you know where the right side and there's a left side we have in this country we really don't have a third-party option

<timemark seconds="6543" />

whenever you have two opposing viewpoints people digging if you seen this new documentary about William F Buckley and Gore Vidal and the debate it's great it's a really interesting the Bates they had during the 1968 election it's fascinating queer and says I'll sock you in the face and you'll stay plastered like that so you know I like 1988 the Brahmin accent is it a Sprite like it's almost British accent but these I mean that saying this my team versus that team and I think the left is guilty of it as much as it seems

<timemark seconds="6603" />

ideas and opinions that sort of cross party lines but they vote on one side or another and they vote for their team I think that's right I think that the people felt so alienated by the other side like to understand be a lot of people to understand that there are a lot of people in the country who felt insulted by the left they were just sick of being called racist sexist biggest homophobes every time someone wanted to bounce a policy on the left and so it's okay screw that delete ROMs not calling me that so I'll do that and then they're a bunch of people on the left and salted by Trump's you can present and they think all the people who voted for Trump are those people until they're fighting racism sexism bigotry and homophobia by voting against Trump would go back to this is a hardening of of it there's not one bubble in the country there's two of the right likes to accuse the left of being in a bubble in in the coast there's a there's about when the right to which is the idea that everybody on the every piece of media is lying to you

<timemark seconds="6663" />

we can't have conversations with each other if we if we do this routine is not healthy across-the-board and there's nothing that's going on where everybody's a Nazi like I've never heard people called a Nazi more than I have over the last 6 months I mean it's been crazy if you support Trump you're not say you're a Neo-Nazi you're here somehow or another you're a fascist if you didn't vote for Hillary the purest form

<timemark seconds="6692" />

yeah I agree it ain't personal demonstrates from Med Assist Oracle ignorance. The Holocaust like you just look at what who Hitler was in the policy promulgated like he was basically he was all over the place when he wanted to talk to social socialist or capitalist was a capitalist he was use a top-down government guy for sure but maybe he would speak the language of you know what would be considered the European far right today on a lot of a lot of issues but then we will talk about redistribution of resources and Universal Health Care and all this kind of stuff no more than gun but he's just a convenient Club I mean it's just a convenience because then say that somebody is Hitler then it actually becomes obligatory to physically resist them then we can have a conversation with Hitler at the very least you won't talk with them and that is really a problem with that the nomenclature right that's really a problem with identifying someone in that way

<timemark seconds="6752" />

they are some of that you have to resist and they are someone who cannot be reasoned with they are someone who is absolutely evil is no like variables or variance and their behavior very political rhetoric I find it fun but I think somebody in a completely evil legitimizes one minute like I'm a bunch of shit from people for even having me on because the idea is going to be well how could you have on some electric. Legitimizing his point of view by having him on I know a lot of people who I politically disagree with who had that experience will have me on their show and it's like how dare you have Shapiro on because you're just granting him cover and I like or we can just have a conversation and maybe will disagree maybe we'll agree I really don't give a fuck about those people I think that's a silly conversation I feel like you should talk to everybody and see if you disagree or agree

<timemark seconds="6812" />

conspiracy I disagree with him wildly and I love him like a brother I don't think you have to agree with people I don't think you have to I'd at the idea that you can't just have a conversation with someone about something and see if you can find middle ground or see if you could clearly defined their point of view or find a perspective that's missing today and the one of the weirdest things about the election was the ping pong match between the left and the right as played out on National Television by the media I would watch specially cable news I would watch Fox News and then go to CNN and go back and forth flip channels that previous channel button on the DirecTV I was just put it on both of them go what what what is she really had Romney was going to win and see which one of these do I believe in it so it's probably some of the middle of a basic rule which is that if you have a New York Times report and then you have a report from my side the daily wire make sure the fact you can probably send the facts are true

<timemark seconds="6872" />

but the opinions that are embedded with the fax those are opinions and that's what's so hard about I think the modern media landscape is trying to separate the fax from the opinion and so this is why when Trump says fake she's not wrong that CNN hates him and that he's right about that true and biased right I'm fruhling by it's right I say things that I think are factual but I'm obviously concerned and that's my point of view you're not touch it so that's right you know Rylan people up saying provocative things we know most people in Revelation on MSNBC because enough to say we're on the left and CNN pretends we have no bias or about all that

<timemark seconds="6929" />

same thing with the New York Times don't worry about all that and then they run the most egregiously bias headlines we don't know if they're lying about that everything was Scott Adams and a particularly because Scott Adams when I have them on my podcast who sings vote test and I'm paying attention to the powers of persuasion and I'm looking at Trends and I'm making some predictions that turned out to be accurate and he's like he's looking at Trump he's not talking about Trump in these glowing terms he's talking about him as being an effective Persuader and he lost millions of dollars because of that opinion talking about a guy that is not even going to vote for him this is all leading up to the election where people are fucking furious at him even more furious at him after Trump one cuz he would do those coffee with Scott things we doesn't Periscope or wakes up he's just start answering asking question

<timemark seconds="6989" />

he's so I measured and comments podcast far over the edge of apologizing for trumpet behavioral and sort of attributing some of Trumps Behavior to that you could say was in the confidence in the in tribute to the like some some some sort of a master plan he tends to believe that everything from does is 987 degree underwater upside down Hungry Hungry Hippos like everything is just a victory I knew everyone involved like every single person was involved in the campaign I knew this was a stumble their way to Victory like I said it is amazing the mind of human beings are we we need to think it's her what the Joker in The Dark Knight we need to think there's a plan we always need to think there's a plan until Trump want it must be because there was some master plan that he unveiled over the course of the campaign

<timemark seconds="7048" />

three weeks before the election he was caught on tape saying that you wanted to grab women by the b word know there was no master plan it's just that Hillary was an awful candidate and no one like her but that lady idea that the Trump was like even the idea that there was like brought national movement for Trump that wasn't there for their candidate you want fewer votes in Wisconsin and Mitt Romney didn't you won the state and that's because no one like this in the untold story of the election this was not a referendum on Donald Trump this is a referendum on Hillary Clinton particularly in the Heartland and people hated her guts right Barack Obama won Ohio walking away everyone talks about Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin Ohio Ohio walking white one of the reasons he won Ohio walking away is because in 2012 Barack Obama vote is like 10% of the general vote in 2012 was like 13 to 15% of the entire margin of victory for Obama in the state of Ohio Hillary got you know closer to sort of the traditional percentages and she lost it

<timemark seconds="7108" />

whopping blowout in Ohio no one likes Hillary Clinton in the west was so arrogant that they thought we can take the most unpopular unlikable unqualified nasty boring human being anyone has seen for 20 years no run her she's the one will run but do you understand host suck at this in a Royal Manor in the primary if you didn't win the primary then he would have to run as an independent then he'd be indie rock right Kid Rock is going to win the primary in the office he grows into a new becomes adult Rock. Do not run for office yet that's what I want to know about running for president you know I'm at the end of the people really wanted it

<timemark seconds="7168" />

would do it if I could Jesus

<timemark seconds="7174" />

wait for the rock opera The Rock The Rock The Rock with Oprah it's a fucking dual slam dunk the rock and roll put together so I have this weird idea that we should actually reinstituted monarchy and it should just be ceremonial and they can get celebrity I'll just make a setup and that person will just be there to look pretty and no power because that's pretty wild this pretty wild I think that you know this is we all thinking in cinematic terms now and Hollywood is run by the jackasses these are not people who you want controlling the narrative and they're like you know what let's see if Tom Hanks would only run

<timemark seconds="7234" />

we really need now the guy from Castaway we need is an actor again we did well with Reagan we need another act we did great with Schwarzenegger the governor before he was the president of the United States in which I don't really understand how much red tape and bullshit you have to go through because I would meet with people and they would agree with me that it's a good idea however they would say my voters are never going to agree with it so I'm going to oppose it even though I know you're right there's a bunch of farmers that are going to be mad at me for doing that so I'm not going to do that. I know you're not okay this isn't the system is built for gridlock it's not like it's going to have to separate houses of Congress

<timemark seconds="7294" />

they are supposed to be able to check the federal government office in The Federalist Papers it was built for gridlock and some people are happy with that because that's how Trump is being like sidelined at every time I tried to make something really important that we all should be happy with the way things were supposed to get passwords of why public support right we should probably a good thing we don't want the government shifting wildly and veering on its axis every four years or every two years I like the gridlock my big problem is now protected a huge system that I don't like that's been built up over a hundred years and in the case of growth of government but I like the Obamacare take no you're not you're not I mean like it you can promise it but now you're not going to do it because you're full of crap when you said it and now you're not going to do it and the gridlock is there and it's hard to change things you know it takes a tremendous effort of an electric powered it's actually change things in a big way it's going to be so easy no it's not it's it wasn't easy for Obama Obama passed Obamacare and that was it first president

<timemark seconds="7354" />

do anything for the next 6 years I leave it there were no major pieces of legislation nothing happened after that he wants Congress and that was it so that's promise number one the other promise is your anger is Justified in this is what I hate even more and that is the idea that end in regular life when you have kids I have kids when your kid is an angry the first thing you have to teach your kid is maybe you're wrong to be angry sometimes but your anger is not justified if you want to make good human beings you have to determine whether they're right to be angry is it is your anger correct politicians are in the business of justifying people saying they're so angry they're so angry okay well I'm angry about things but are they angry about the right things right like you're right to be angry because you lost your job and Podunk Ohio because it's being stolen by the Chinese or by the Mexicans or something and it's like well is that actually true or are you just pandering to the anger and on the left is your people say this to it to black folks in the inner-city it's the system that's keeping you down as a racist white supremacist system it's keeping you down there was that true or

<timemark seconds="7414" />

just pandering to the Builder because it's hard to tell people hard foods like you're not right to be angry get off your ass and do something with your life and it's true but regardless of race you go out there no one cares enough to stop you in your life you live is your own no one United States cares about you want to stop you want to throw obstacles up in your own way I'm not sure you can win the election on the basis of go live your own life even though everyone keeps claiming they want to live their own life I think most people are the most people don't want to live their own life they want a politician to tell them that all of their complaints about life being unfair are Justified and politicians going to solve all that we don't want people who stay out of our way we want people to be Mommy and that's that's a tempting attempting proposition for Valentine's Day because you're dealing with people that have the momentum of all their failures in their life and all the different things are not going right and then they are this moment today right now and they want to figure out why and why they're not on track in the house how to get on track and the easiest ways to point the finger or blame some

<timemark seconds="7474" />

and everybody has their own hand I'm not saying that people's hands are are fair and that in a tremendous amount of psychological factors that go into why someone does or does not succeed and to placate them or to you know to play on those psychological factors as new not being their own fault it's very tempting because it works with people people love to hear that they love to hear that it's not your fault and I think that's what politicians have become in the business of doing and it's both right and left it's just people saying that it's it's not your fault because you're being screwed by some foreign country it's not your fault because the immigrants are doing it to you it's not your fault maybe some maybe some of that true but you have to show me why it's true I have to show me what the actual like did you lose your job because of it because of China or did you lose your job because you're in an industry that is being crowded out because

technological change because you're Union straka created wages to high be globally competitive what's look at the actual logic Hair Biz to end is it something we have to do or is it a matter of you brought your sales at like 8:00 you see a lot of people now we're stuck in the mindset of 30 years ago that you're going to work a job and stay there for 20 years and then are going to go and then you're going to leave with gold watch and the job market right now is a college student you can expect it in the next 10 years will probably work for jobs not like that the turnover is Super 8 and you have to be constantly increasing your skill-set businesses that Branch out and become do and then there's also businesses that died and there's no bringing the back yet you're not going to bring back the printing press is that there's a lot of stuff that I can find the printing press industry right now they're trying to stop automated cars I mean that does that mean that was it there was a vote vote like within the last day of

<timemark seconds="7594" />

to to try to block automated trucks because there's a tremendous amount of people that are people you know that this is the great fallacy that's been people been trying to fight since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution is this idea okay well the new technologies going to kill jobs and then no one will ever work again for the last hundred years and now she's a little bit better teachers convince Congress to block driverless trucks that's that's crazy well I mean imagine that how is that going to work for all the other industries that are affected let's say that you now have your you're artificially raising the prices of all the good that now have to be brought in by the teamsters and that's more expensive so it's more money out of my pocket in my pocket that's money that maybe I was willing to buy American Mahna Mahna by Chinese cuz I have to feed my family like this is that's not how I cannot miss work since you're not.

<timemark seconds="7654" />

and you're a bad driver the Google car is probably going to crash or make it more likely get in a crash than that if we're coming driving up he ever seen people freak out those Tesla cars actually talk to me just to Google car when you are when the car is on that automated thing they slam on the brakes and back up on you people using automated car so it's it's it's not done it's not your lighter cars on the road but there are a lot more dangerous than they have your cars do they have your car's the Clunkers are still around 1970 in their tanks there's one through three. How do you feel about Universal basic income cuz that's a subject

<timemark seconds="7714" />

comes up a lot lately when Elon Musk is talking about these driverless cars 1 the things he saying is that one thing that we're going to need is universal basic income he said we're going to have to figure out some way to feed all these people they're going to get taken out of the job market because their jobs become irrelevant so I think that Universal basic income is 412 technology get so good that they're legitimately are no jobs I don't think they were there yet so if you have a machine that can make everything basically for free and there's a bunch of people who don't need any more to do work then you can talk about Universal basic income because there's no scarcity scarcity is what creates a need for labor so if there's any industry then there's going to be need for for labor there's going to be need for new labor people going to still have to work on these trucks and deal with technology and the computer industry didn't destroy jobs all over the United States and typewriters one out so I think it's a little premature I'm not sure if there will ever be a day when there's a machine that it when the machine Society is so well develop that I can take over all job I do think you're saying bifurcation in the labor market so then people who aren't just like yours in mine

<timemark seconds="7774" />

we're lucky this is a creative job it's hard for machines to create but for job that are single past jobs that a lot more of those are going to be technologically driven and so people are going to have to go work the right time to bring a little bit we're going to have to train people in a different way but Matt my perspective on universal basic income is when you have a 4% unemployment rate it's very difficult to say you need to get a personal basic income who can work are working so that's not that's not that. Suggesting to me that there's just passed under class of people who aren't coat totally incapable of working and once you do that you see what you've seen actually with the disability programs in the United States right now everybody's on disability and fastest-growing government program in America's the disability program or people declare themselves disabled so they can get government pensions basically Universal basic income is there an incentive to work and also I'm not sure that you saw the lot of people's problems like people still see if you need something to do with her day

<timemark seconds="7834" />

stop these people's inherent creativity and I'll find something to do when your 33 using the term holy at 11 again because I just know too many people who are tired and 6 months later enjoy doing things and feeling like they're valuable you know and I don't know if that necessarily has to be a job but it's a very clear definitive test of whether or not your valuable if somebody gives you money and you get that money you like look I'm valuable I'm doing something I'm contributing I got a check for my heart is filled with watercolor painting and be poetry classes I don't know what to do but I see you but I I've been fairly self-employed most of my life I think it just of God

<timemark seconds="7894" />

there's a difference in people who take things to do maybe some point down the road coming to run for president or something like that and apparently anyone can in this is what I'm finding out or doing in the sense that I get to work on what people believe which I think is sort of the root of a politics I'm not sure implementing is the same thing as I said I'm not sure that the president can get like I'm more focused on getting people to thinking the times that I'd like them to thank you know about limited government and you taking control of your own life and I might be able to do more good you know promulgating that message using a growing medium like what are the podcast went from having $3,000 interest in a 300 episodes ago it so now we have $300,000 a day you know so it's it's it continues to grow

<timemark seconds="7954" />

sad want to jump into politics not easier I think subject because the people that don't want limited government the government's going to be effective if you give the more money I got an argument with a friend where he wanted people to be taxed more because he felt like that money could be distributed to people and you would get like more funding for the Arts one of his arguments but it might my phone was like first of all the Arts like when they're Valley when people like them they pay for him if funding for the Arts means you're going to have like fucking lock box of joe the LA County Museum of Art and have a fucking box on the ground someone's calling a piece of art LACMA where he went there and he took off his glasses and just put them on the floor and then he stood next time going

<timemark seconds="8014" />

rush it right that modern art exhibits pretentious and it's also a stoking those fires of pretension and making something that's not legitimately creative making it a celebrated because you don't really have the ability to it's it's funny how a lot of people who want better government the Embrace states that start to draw the government and then when things go to shit there like nowhere to be found so Venezuela's most obvious example of Venezuela has turned from what was the richest country in South America and had the best oil reserves in the Western Hemisphere Metairie stop down there and he was at his camera man got shot he was who's watching people like literally shooting dogs in the streets for food and visited me to Caracas is the most violent city in the Western Hemisphere now and all

<timemark seconds="8074" />

this is because Google Chaves was a piece of garbage who centralize all power to himself redistribute the wealth to all of his friends and cronies and then and then supposedly uplifted the pool right now everyone is for a friend who's the head of the Labour party in Great Britain and it all just praising Chavez right he's a great guy he was a hero to the poor and now then if I was going to try it and we're all these people like Cameron shauntay split-face like now I just asked Sean Penn's out like 5 minutes ago you were saying this was awesome but it's got to be some sort of a left response for that like what it what is there take on why it all went well you know this is them living on this because they never really got rid of enough Private Industry if they just want to work with her it would have been better it's like all the Soviet Union didn't work out that great either but I actually got a response is really fun

<timemark seconds="8134" />

and today I tweeted out that according to the World Bank Venezuela has one of the least income unequal sides on it so it's actually pretty income equal only has anything right and the end its garbage until the the Socialist the official Socialist Party tweeted me and they said this is because socialism has never truly been fried

<timemark seconds="8155" />

okay dude alright sure why not everything out and that you shouldn't get paid more for that no one should get paid more in that everyone should have some sort of like I'll pop a peek that you can reach right there sounds like Bernie Sanders Democratic socialism to buy a bunch of land and expand the college and then the fucking College went under and now they're being sued and vacation homes western Europe in the Netherlands right so that there's always look at these Democratic Socialist countries the working right first of all a car in Denmark have a 60% import tax and cost literally twice what it would cost in the United States text

<timemark seconds="8215" />

in Denmark are insane except for corporate taxes which the left in the United States really want those higher than Mark has some of the lowest corporate taxes and regulations in the industrialized world so everybody is coming in and investing in Denmark it's only the citizens were getting screwed by paying for this child welfare state then their GDP tanked and other governments is Flashback but it turns out that capitalism is Singapore is there nothing on Singapore Singapore is like a rock nothing there Singapore has won the most powerful economies on Earth because they basically have no business regulations note accident and no terrorist everyone can do whatever they want to make a lot of mutually beneficial exchanges and I'm sorry it's not that difficult but it but it is difficult if you think the wife is unfair right so what would you propose would you propose to do is reinvigorate manufacturing make things in America

<timemark seconds="8275" />

jobs are going to overseas in other countries in South America and I don't think my job is a job and industries that are thriving after need more jobs and industries that are not doing as well if the job is going to disappear that's just the wages of a global economy people who are in those Industries but it's not reference on you or your value is just saying that certain industries overtime always you know are outsourced like we used to make t-shirts in the United States I'm not going to privilege one that I understand why this is politics you want a favor manufacturing bases cuz there's a lot of manufacturing hubs in Pennsylvania Ohio Michigan Wisconsin vote since I don't care my view is is that if you want to thriving economy relieved as much regulation is possible you lower the taxes for everyone personal and corporate you attract as much foreign investment as possible and you allow people to build businesses with his little risk as possible and then you will

<timemark seconds="8334" />

compete and if they succeed a 16 if they fail they fail and you get rid of tariffs as well because I want cheap input for my product and I want you product on the shelves at the stores don't have to pay up the Jillian dollars for a pair of shoes so mighty love this is that economists No Limit the freedom I am a free person I get to do with my money when I damn well please and you don't have to stand my way unless there is some sort of moral thing right like if you want to say let's put sanctions on let's put sanctions on a rhombus protection on China right China Fun in North Korea right now security won't put sanctions on try not to try and pressure them into any more Creek national security thing like today in trumpworld out this new plan on immigration and he says I want to cut down on illegal immigration but the reason is because I want to raise wages of people in the United States but I think that's not productive because what you're actually doing is restricting the supply of labor artificially increasing the wages which are officially increases prices which means it's not competitive on a global scale which means that companies Outsource

<timemark seconds="8394" />

you create a minimum wage artificially increase in wages that increases prices that makes a non-competitive people Outsource so it actually choose the opposite of what you're trying to achieve all government intervention in the economy save for interventions that are designed to prevent externalities and things that I do the hurt you all of those are unjustified in my view what about Environmental Protection over my fence into your yard that's different thing that's it that's one of the most disturbing things about this Administration is the cutting the funding for the Environmental Protection Agency in the changing of their standards removing some of the funding for things like the satellites they using to track the climate change and things on those lines and scares the shit out of me like it scared the shit out of me they're going to ignore the environment in favor of the economy and some of them are overwrought

<timemark seconds="8454" />

fracking Obama being pushed a lot of environmental regulations on fracking of the Keystone XL pipeline what do you think about like when they worry about more earthquakes happening and instable Water Supplies I take the tables earthquake again if you present me evidence that I find convincing I'm happy to change my mind and as far as the as far as water pollution so if that changes then I'm happy to regulate it as far as when you say there has been instances of fracking leading to pollution right but that's not every fracking leads to Blue and so the question is how is the regulation or how many are you willing to accept wheel drive cars how much water bottles

<timemark seconds="8514" />

how much are you willing to accept what I don't appreciate is when people like oh well I accept my semi water on fire because of fracking site but I know that's not because of fracking that's because as far as the satellites in in global warming listen I think it's pretty clear that the climate is is warming I'm in the greenhouse gas effect is a thing the question to me is less whether it's happening and more what are you going to do about it because even left seems to have no real solutions as to what to do except for massively cutting economic growth and it seems to me that if we're talking about an increase in the ipcc if something is 7 degrees Fahrenheit over the course of The Next Century then on average right not not universally on average then it seems to me that it's easier to just say that the climate changes over time and maybe cities are on the closer going to have to pull back a little bit over time I got a hundred years a long time and it's a hundred years ago to said that the the pollution was the chief thing to worry about it

<timemark seconds="8574" />

how to say to a girl using smoke stacks and now not really into regulation Market competition now you've gotten better environmental products the market does take care of a lot of the same people don't actually want to live in in human waste you know like we we actually don't want to do that so I don't know how many times I see Bill Nye on TV talking about climate change is a stand-up guy yeah and she has this thing with Tucker Carlson's which is great and keep saying okay but you're talking about science so tell me how much of an effect human beings have on climate change and what what is what's the science show any and all he wanted to say was that you know are you okay

<timemark seconds="8634" />

what is the difference to do in order in Europe climate change if we can't do that in order to minimize it what's the actual risk also why people keep giving me these catastrophic scenario is what it looks like the day after tomorrow and Dennis Quaid running in the Subways and shit like that age now that's not going to happen like Jesus Christ man that's good times and he's an expert in collisions an asteroid on collision and one of them's he said is like he goes global warming is not great he goes but it's way better than global cooling this is true well I'm sure it was actually pretty good thing for the world and in this is this is the other thing is that there are costs and benefits to the climate-changing witches hat which it has throughout time what are we going to sacrifice in order to prevent in order to make that 7 degrees into 6 degrees

<timemark seconds="8694" />

rice losing some coastline is not the real issue about the C absorption of emissions right that I didn't like the toxification of the ocean like that seems to be to be a bigger problem then the climate changed over time we're pretty adaptable like there's a lot of land okay so we move we have historically been Venice the the sea level rise in Venice every year people are going to move him in like that's just that's the way it works and and shoot them this is weird idea and it's it's true in economics it's true it's a little warmer that where you were born is where you must die brand that you can never move in the Cinemas Mobile Society in human history hours before so if if we did you really think that the climate is that that first of all I'd like to ask Barbra Streisand if she's that deeply concerned about global warming life doesn't Suncoast want to say but is it it's like to lose a lot of sleep of a bunch of Hollywood stars

<timemark seconds="8754" />

5 feet off their clothes line because we didn't kill the industry of the United States and lose for $20 a year like no and I'm not really sure that that would have worked that way one way or another that has been absolutely proven that human beings are having an effect on the carbon dioxide levels are just like there's no solution that I know for sure is going to do that so you're talking about human being suffering in the now for the later and let's be real about this like they're a lot of nations from the United States for the weeding emitters on the planet right now we're trying to Nidia and they're not going to stop anytime soon like that that's not going to happen if you even discuss it you become like a Hitler or a Nazi become a climate change denier and once you get locked into one of those labels you know you're a piece of shit what this is and yeah nobody wants to be locked in

<timemark seconds="8814" />

I don't want to have the discussion of the debate and that's one of the things that I felt like Bill Nye was not prepared for because I felt like he's so lazy with this conversation because so many people just appease him and agree with it across and was challenging him on it he didn't have any data to support this argument he just wanted to sort of like play word games and and have this week you know so well you know you guys on CNN there was one time when it when they had some guy on who was saying exactly what we were saying that the models did they have not been proven to be accurate and that Al Gore's movie predicted that we'd be underwater in 2014 the first billion-dollar green guy off of giving you speeches Canton trade and the whole thing is very strange because it becomes this

<timemark seconds="8874" />

hatchable subject like what we're talking about before with transgender people wear with many other subjects become you can't discuss them they're not even open to debate or scrutiny they they become lockdown and when Tucker Carlson was pressing Bill not like what is what are the numbers like what is happening tell me how much of an effect we having and Bill Nye had nothing on it and rice became stammered and start getting angry is like wow this is weird this is weird to see I mean if this is the cause of your life you should know a little bit more about it then everyone who disagrees is a denier I'm not saying Bill nye's the wrong guy shouldn't be so you can't have me come on a fucking show and talk about global warming cuz I should say listen

<timemark seconds="8934" />

intergovernmental panel on climate change did this study you can look up the numbers there I don't have them off the top of my head out the numbers I know buddy I was actually does their prep for debate or for TV appearances like because the truth is you think you're going to be on for five haven't done a thousand TV at this point most people think okay I'm gone for 5 minutes and get through 5 minutes right really really that bad if I'm on for 10 minutes how bad can I be and answers unit pants down there is like you're born this way yeah, everyone in my family talks that it that if it's that way but yeah even my kids. Talk to his wife in the world

<timemark seconds="8994" />

example. It's a sub it's such an effective way to communicate with us three heads and the other one person who's the host Thor the Megyn Kelly throwing a question and then this person is talking over that person and it's such an ineffective on TV it's like okay you have 30 seconds of a point excellent we can make that work for us yeah but unless you are unless you're doing something along those lines were no one's there but you and you get to expand Express Yourself there's no form of conversation like podcast word

<timemark seconds="9054" />

you're not getting interrupted by a commercial you just talkin and you know as well as I know that conversation sort of evolve and move and they you know when I get to know you better I see how your thinking better and I kind of have more questions to ask and you expand more and you get to know a person for real and that's just those those television shows are so there it's so divisive in that way and I don't feel like I'm getting tons of information that way and they're interrupting each other and wrote it last night it's just the best you can hope for is that you have 30 seconds when you say something that goes viral that's basically the extent of it

<timemark seconds="9114" />

you're good at it but we were talking about before that a lot of the people that have debated like they have this supposed passion for something but when it comes to preparing for this sort of interaction they're not really doing that they're not for sure I think part of that is no more about the other specialty than I do on a lot of topics like if I were discussing climate change with a person who has much as that person sure but right now like I don't want facts about one thing in the state you were denied her and then I beat you about the left in this is not saying that there's not some sort of a real issue with human waste because I think there is I think it said there's a giant issue with plastic in the ocean is a giant issue with pollutants in our way

<timemark seconds="9174" />

water system in are in there and there's a lot of issues with the side effects of being a person in the industrialized civilization there's we got to figure out a way to be sustainable I don't think there's any denying that by anybody okay fair enough but if you go to places to donate carbon-based bills that Bernie animal dog and what there's nothing worse for particulate then then animal would so even better than then they will get to nuclear power right which unfortunately a lot of people have banned because of on base fear like most of France's electricity is provided by nuclear power and that's not as clean as guess so well Togo's Fukushima even even in worst case scenario at Fukushima I mean if you're talking about the if your

<timemark seconds="9234" />

is a lot larger than Fukushima a wall of ice around the containment area and that didn't work it seems so fucking science fiction e and they really don't know what to do and I don't know enough about nuclear containment to take off let's just say that one disaster in and basically have been three major disaster at Chernobyl Three Mile Island and Fukushima the only one that's happened to of those three of happen in the first world right Fukushima and Three Mile Island Three Mile Island basically ended up having no long-term impact of fiction is really the only major disaster in 40 Years of industrialized countries using nuclear power really discussed it was all during the 60s 50s and the 60s when they were involved in the rocket program

<timemark seconds="9294" />

the Rocketdyne stuff my friend's dad is a scientist news explain to me the half-life of whatever was released in the atmosphere it's nothing to concern but there's a bunch of it was a bunch of articles that were written about it like worrying about people that have higher cancer rates in this area and you know but this also like the website called the sins of Rocketdyne really see if you can find that there's a website dedicated to that that people but it's not cancer just living in cities man like they say the one of the worst environments for a human beings living in a place that has a lot of brake dust living in Manhattan and get your window open in hayling particulates from people there it is the sins of Rocket done

<timemark seconds="9343" />

but the thing is like I mean how much more cancer are these people exist from 2000 does random statistical Group by so how much of it is due to X Factor or wife actor from lung cancer situation where smoking obviously causes lung cancer most cancer is like breast cancer we have no idea why it happens if a Thousand Oaks over the hill and you look down the volume like Jesus that can't be good yeah I've been flying into the atmosphere you think that's not great obviously we have gotten better

<timemark seconds="9403" />

relaxed some of the the standards that I wonder how much of the car emission standards like there's actually a pretty thriving debating libertarian Community for taking a little bit about with a K standards or what drove greater fuel efficiency or whether it was the price of gas to propane or fuel efficiency as the price of gas has is risen and Fallen you see people change their buying Habits by the nineties everybody but an SUV and then the prices went up everybody we bought the part for you as well the prettiest thing is interesting to because I knew what the environmental disasters of creating these batteries yes and you like hell this is not totally green yeah like there's some weird gray area to it is pretty complexion and I think that's the one thing we know is that they're millions of people all over the world for ultimate history have been living in an absolute pain you're in misery and we now support 7 billion people on the planet and the rate of global poverty has dropped by 50% in the

<timemark seconds="9462" />

30 years a lot of that is technological change a lot of that is fossil fuel use and so before we you know what we always have to ban these are two things that are worth thinking about balancing this is what I got a little frustrating sometimes you see people on the environmental left will say well this has to be done or it's the end of the world as well how about those people in developing countries how many of those people you going to say have to live in poverty in order for this to happen and then on the right you'll see people say well no environmental regulations at all just let it all hashed out and you know sometimes the market has it out and sometimes the market doesn't cash it out and so again I think a little Caution as warranted I think that's a very good point of view and that's one of the things that I really liked about your commentary I know you're right leaning guy but you're very reasonable you you make arguments or sound and easy to trace it makes sense but I appreciate it I think we need more of that you know what I think this it's rare that you find out in a 33 year old guy that says some strange sort of conservative character that travels around clown is healing University

<timemark seconds="9522" />

what's going to happen when is it going to happen that's supposed to happen good luck with all that low profile of these places and you see the antipope people in there screaming and yelling and cheering and that's got to be a real thing that it's just you and your thoughts and your opinion I mean you're not selling babies you're not there Slaughter and dogs in Festival is KKK members coming to campus go go go stop him when I spoke to a couple professors were telling their students that I was at closet remember the KKK

<timemark seconds="9582" />

KKK I'm like to try to remember it's my thing that year I was kidding 2016 is a wild year so I was so David Duke accused me of being a far leftist black lives matter accused me of being a member of the KKK and I was the number one recipient of anti-Semitism from the according to the Anti-Defamation League I was the number one recipient of Twitter anti-Semitism in the United States for journalists last year says why is a little trophy in my house cuz most hated you in America is a hell of a title

<timemark seconds="9615" />

the green frog in a little model the gas Chambers burned on the internet in 2016 were directed to me personally just party temporary tweeted anybody I get somebody at gate in Abilene on you please don't get mad because as soon as I recently just be hit by waves of these people it is and it's it's really gone down a fair bit but you know I did that there were some pretty serious I got people calling my cell phone and it was probably me putting Breitbart so so when I was I was not I was not vote for either candidate in this year's election

<timemark seconds="9675" />

I support him and his positions he was the closest to me so I was not pro Trump during the primaries he didn't earn my vote during the general election I thought that it like there's two ways to look at your Innocent but I was headed people who you want to but for me there's two ways to look at your phone at the coupon expires November 9th right and so either use it or lose it or it's just it it says something about what you are willing to accept and it's possible that there can be election we're both candidates so I can you just don't want either of them and think either of these people was qualified to be president of the United States some of the stuff like Gorsuch I love and some of the stuff like Nick brudzinski's bloody face I'm not so hot outside

<timemark seconds="9735" />

I too I was working at Breitbart and then I quit in the middle of the election cycle after there was an incident report it to the cops it was her body didn't like move like she was being injured and that she had bruises so, video Disney Channel that comes to mind is a bialy listen punch writing it.

<timemark seconds="9792" />

yeah there were three there a bunch of different excuses that Breitbart one through on that one was that she was never grabbed all the second was it was a secret service guy and then third was that that Trump thought she was a security threat and Corey Lewandowski had to protect from from this 90 pounds soaking wet and so then it's a real question for me was not know what a horrible thing to happen to her about as a journalistic entity do you stand by reporters or do you stand by the candidate who you support and once Breitbart make clear to me that you knew this but I was there token on Trump guy became clear that they were willing to sort of sacrifice journalistic credibility on the altar of getting close to Trump then I was out and then it's no longer journalistic and that sort of started the the ball rolling responses on Twitter before then

<timemark seconds="9852" />

a lot of people who follow Breitbart and Milo yiannopoulos and they're pissed at me and I was like oh yeah I'm in people enjoyed it obviously that's a weird thing about the online hate is how much people enjoy it I mean I said the Chipmunks of college students about you know DD all right it didn't first of all I think it's important to mention actually all right just cuz you like me and doesn't make you out right but like there's a group of people who actually liked Richard Spencer and Jared Taylor in the race based identity politics of white supremacy and those people are actually out right when the alt-right is is coming after you then it's not a lot of fun but they didn't to will Retreat things from like things that are obviously nasty are going to hurt them in the future career on Facebook

<timemark seconds="9911" />

you may think it's funny and 10 years and your house and there a lot of people that are fall into this idea that what you do online is not a mess and it is not it is not going to it's just a matter of time for a blows like you filed the entry to the Donald Sterling Saga really bothered me because you said something shity to his girlfriend about Magic Johnson when there's no evidence that there's actual discrimination among clients at the Clippers and then chore boy got his team and do what the NBA has to do but like I'm pretty certain that every human being has crappy things to their intimate loved ones about groups of people in other people and if the snap

<timemark seconds="9971" />

it seems like I was just I was just saying Harvard her job because his interview with Anderson Cooper was on the classic interviews of all timers, so yeah yeah I guess he's a KKK threatening figure like I can't even find the toilet in the morning

<timemark seconds="10032" />

he said

<timemark seconds="10033" />

do me a favor he goes I don't Beatles don't take pictures of black eyes he goes in the next sense he said I don't care if you fuck them just don't take pictures of I go

in my world that's pretty reasonable like you got a girl you're buying or a Ferrari all you say just don't take any pictures you can fuck them she should just like leave well enough alone you're getting a Ferrari out of the deal I think that was that whole thing was just like it was our capacity to get ourselves outrageous into trouble buddy how outraged we work well the president of the NBA what his name is what is it got a gun on TV we talk about is a gold digger and an old man stories all this time he said some stupid shit old people say stupid shit but on the bright side he told her she can go fuck black guy so hey everybody's happy and everybody looking better passer

<timemark seconds="10105" />

I think that if you look at the NBA statistics in who watches the NBA that they outside number of people who watch the NBA are black and there's no way into a lot of people were like any of those I want to lose our fan base over there was money decision another words I don't think it was a valley of decision as much of a busted him and put him like put his kids or his wife in charge of the team like this idea you're going to force him to sell his team we're going to spend the clippers because there was a tape of an old man saying stupid ass things to a gold digger Is It Anyway and he wound up making more money from that team that he ever would have so much more valuable
