Andrew Weil

<timemark seconds="460" />

The Joe Rogan Experience

<timemark seconds="470" />

all the way from Tucson Arizona dr. Weil how are you I am good thank you doing this man appreciate it if you come highly recommended by many human beings and I know how do you get such a fine reputation well I'm doing the same things for a long time just putting one foot ahead of the other and saying what I know to be true and push your stuff tasted really bad matcha powder okay and it's got such a huge surface area that oxidizes very quickly so if it's not properly packed and stored it loses its brilliant green Colour turns yellow green or gray green it gets bitter and loses its taste I got to say most of them onto the Pisces served in this country is of that sort at many cup never had the good stuff what's the benefits of matcha that I know there's

<timemark seconds="530" />

never seen a green color like that just amazing and the flavors of deep shade for the last 3 weeks before Harvest so the in response to that the leaves produce more chlorophyll more antioxidants more the good stuff so it's got the you know much more of the things you want and it sounds like a pop top by Pringles chips with inform lumps and then you whisk it but that traditional bamboo whisk or you buy a little electric whisker and you can whisk in the hot water or cold water and it's very yummy and what does it do for you like what's a good well you've got its got caffeine of course so you get stimulated by it but it's also got l-theanine which is this relaxed and compound that modifies the effect of caffeine and produces a state of RI

<timemark seconds="590" />

laxed alertness so it doesn't have the effect of coffee right and you're getting all of these antioxidant benefits it will document in one of these little whisks cool it's like a real bamboo made from one piece of bamboo it's a miracle of Japanese craftsmanship beautiful it's beautiful so good morning and have a glass of iced matcha later in the day so she in warm weather I love it it's a good thing I first tasted it when I was 17 I was an exchange student in Japan 1959 I live with a family outside of Tokyo we had no language in common and on the second night I was there the mother took me next door to her neighbors who practice tea ceremony and they did this thing for me and I was fascinated by that whisk in the color of the Masha and I thought it was great and we never thought I'd be able to get it over here

<timemark seconds="645" />

yeah well so you you import the stuff yourself is that mean I started a company called the sicarii we've got the URL matzav.com and I went to Japan to Fuji which is a little town outside choto where which is the center of the best tea production in Japan and I sourced really good matcha you know they're many graves in March of the most the highest are too expensive to use for everyday used to really like truffles or be able to find the best matcha that is Affordable and make it available to people here so like the highest level stop how much would it cost for a cup of tea card estimate for a cop you know if possibly that is a preparation cold sick tea in Japan where they used three times the amount of powder and probably one bowl of that stuff we shared by several people I don't know what could be $100 a bowl low

<timemark seconds="700" />

what how why do they catch on in Japan like that it's always been in Japan for a very long time in the end this powdered tea preparation was originally taken up by Zen monks to help them stay awake during long hours and meditation is also associated with the Samurai and became the Tea Ceremony developed around that is there anything that is similar to it is like yerba mate or guarana or any other companies are experience the effect is mellower of caffeine so you get stimulated get alert but it doesn't have the jangling effective are these other caffeine beverages do you drink regular coffee as well and I've never owned coffee that was turned off because my parents when I was going up drank really strong black coffee with no sugar cream I couldn't imagine why people would Savages they were different people did you grow up in a Northern climate

<timemark seconds="760" />

yeah see which one is cold outside and I do believe that black coffee bright green shining Rasha things that are good for your many things are good for you like bell peppers or something like that they have a beautiful color to the oldies the health benefits of fruits and vegetables a lot of have to do with these pigments and the pigments the plants produce their part of their own defensive system and they do good things in us and the one piece of advice that I often give people as you should try to eat across the color spectrum everyday it was red what was purple different benefits is a scientific perspective

<timemark seconds="820" />

do you think the people should very those colors and then they given day or as much as you can across any day try to get across the color spectrum that's a good thing to just get as many of them as in it is you can so do you take this approach with fruits with with all sorts of different things just fishing vest you know I've been more concerned with the more pay attention to it is sustainability when it comes to fish absolutely it seems like especially ocean fish that human beings are just terrible monsters famous oceanographers Sylvia Earle who is the woman that held the record for the deepest dive and she came up to me in a meeting once and pleaded with me not to recommend that people eat fish she said they're just not going to be any the future and that's probably true you know probably the future is going to be formed fish and that can be done in a responsible way

<timemark seconds="880" />

you can get the good guys want to put out for the Monterey aquarium you can get a Wallet card that list the list fish and shellfish and rates them both by toxicity and sustainability that's a good guy the following mollusk sea mollusks I like oysters and scallops what is what is LED you to not eat chicken or fish or Darby feather in a long time and date and I was interested in yoga I knew what we're doing yoga had become vegetarian of my friends of mine that had become vegetarian I thought well I'll just try for a little while and it agreed with me I didn't fish for a number of years and I found that maitre international travel very difficult especially to Japan and then I was reading about all the research on the good stuff and fish and I started eating fish and that that way of eating reason he were well

<timemark seconds="940" />

is it is a thing that agree with you saying right really depended upon a person's very individual so I have no problem telling people to stay away from refining process to manufacture food that's the bad stuff yeah that's a really good clear thing that everybody can kind of applying their life but as far as like what is going to work for you there's a lot of trial-and-error involved is my favorite engine see what works for you know you practice what would you how would you call Integrative Medicine to find that well it's Medicine of the future and you know what the short a short history of the intelligent combination of conventional and alternative medicine but really it's it's a system that focuses on the body's ability to heal itself that looks at people as whole persons not just physical bodies that takes account of all aspects of Lifestyle an understanding of an illness values the practitioner patient relationship and makes use of all therapies no matter where they come from that show reasonable

<timemark seconds="1000" />

Prince of Africa Cena not going to hurt people so I'm absolutely convinced this is the way out of the healthcare crisis so I've been training doctors and other health professionals in it for many years now he's ability to heal itself how would you accentuate that with this to me is the thing that's most missing from medical education medical school was enough and wound healing witch in my first year of course in histology to me the most marvelous thing about our bodies as if they have the capacity of themselves you get a cut you can watch it heal on that that happens throughout the body into the DNA molecule loses the big molecule on the border of life and non-life it has within it the ability to know movie quotes when it's been injured of a cosmic ray not support that out instantly it begins to manufacture repair enzymes that that duplicate the missing piece and pasted in and you can see that same thing

<timemark seconds="1060" />

biological organization and to me that's where good medicine should start that the body has within it the ability to maintain equilibrium heal itself has this ability of what what do you do to accentuate that when I listen to a patient and hear their story at the back of my mind I'm thinking why is healing not happening here but what can I do from outside that can facilitate that I can't put it into somebody but I can help it along by either of supplying energy missing materials remove obstacles to it you know like you have a woman that doesn't heal maybe there's a foreign body and it feels now when you have people that come to that have issues like save someone comes to and they have a back issue of lower back pain do you approach that from terms of like how they're eating other living the lifestyle first I would question him about lifestyle for sure but you know I'm a great follower of a man who died recently named John Sarno who is in the panda

<timemark seconds="1120" />

is work sure he has some great books mind over back pain healing back pain is that the vast majority of back pain is muscle spasm which originates in the mind and it may localized at an Area physical injury but it is the injury is not the cause of it you can live with a slipped disc and have no pain you look at X-rays I need to find slip the what does it mean is available and unless there's Associated neurological symptoms you don't want to do anything about that unless it's pressing on a driveway John Sarno was idea was that it's a lot of stress and anxiety and a lot of different psychological factors of the right and I'm sure he was some kind of incredible healer many people who did that lost her back pain for a

<timemark seconds="1180" />

just listening to him so other people had that have just reading his book a little bit of a legitimate injuries so whenever I hear someone say oh it's all in your head. It's not all in your head in your head and your muscles and the problem of muscle spasm which shuts off blood supply and it's a vicious cycle that a localized in an area you've had physical injury pain is not coming from the injuries coming from muscle spasm and that's controlled by greatly influenced by the mine so when you when your back is like seizes up that is a muscle spasm and it's incredibly painful and it's located in the area of the injury soda refuse you into thinking it's the injury that's causing you pain wasn't happy that you may not be necessary yeah I'm a big believer and waiting especially with spinal stops

<timemark seconds="1240" />

you look at the here's another interesting thing you can look at X-rays of people's minds that looks so horrible you can't imagine that they can move and they have nothing nothing no symptoms and you can look at other x-rays that look perfect and people are disabled buy paint so there's a very low correlation between the physical findings and subjective experience know what is Sarno recommend I never really ignoring it going about your business and if possible try to figure out you know what what message you know who your mind is sending down there but basically it's reassurance that it would go away on its own so when he does he's sure since he has people tourism of it is just he just reassuring them that everything's not okay and it's process of how he called the tension myositis syndrome and he explains the mechanism of how it were one friend of mine he was in his late twenties played about a basketball had a very serious herniated disc he was within hours of having neurological surgery

<timemark seconds="1300" />

no surgery and I yelled at him to read this book and see sarno's in New York and he said I don't believe any of that sold bullshit and I said go go see him so he went to see him or went to the evening lectures thought this was nonsense went home was having dinner and realized his back pain was gone never had surgery to pick something to the placebo effect alright so there is if that is a real things you can convince your body that it's got the medicine that it needs and starts to heal even though there's no medicine and there's got to be something that is working against you was well with the wrong people rediscovering the placebo effect now I wrote a book in my throat is the greatest problem is that we know when we talked and phrases like how do you know that's not just a placebo effect the most interesting word there it's just we have to rule out the placebo

<timemark seconds="1360" />

you should be ruling it in man that's the meat of medicine that's Pure Healing from within mediated by belief on mixed up with the Direct effects of treatment that's what you want to make happen more the time it just is a mind fog for a lot of people cuz it like how my trick of myself into getting better why can't I just do it because of the brain that the part of the brain in which are will is isn't doesn't connect directly to the Machinery of the body on and on and nervous system so you have to find some way of getting around that one way is to project belief on the something external and then let it work for you but that's so strange that the mind works that way would seem like when it be an evolutionary Advantage just have it at access you know like sure that be nice but that's the same thing why can't you just get high without taking a drug the high is in your brain not in the drug the drug is a trigger that releases it why can't we just sit down sit while going to be high for the next 10 minutes the same thing we don't have access to the

<timemark seconds="1420" />

controls it just seems like that one though she feeling any better that seems like it's something that we should as a culture concentrate on yet we're sure what we really concentrate on his actual medicine is by giving people greater confidence in their bodies ability to do that and doctors have great power to do that because patients project a lot of belief on them had many patients over the years who said the most important thing I did for them was that I was the only Doctor Who told them they could get better I mean astonishing patients and their overwhelmed and they got legal bills and they have I think some I thought about this a lot and there's also the negative side of this I've seen what this only called medical hexing and which doctors say things that actually interfere with you and your cause people to get worse and I think a lot of us is done unconsciously so here's one of my thoughts in their training.

<timemark seconds="1480" />

see a very skewed sampled sick people they see very sick people in hospitals and in that group healing is less likely to happen but if you look at the total spectrum of illness the vast majority of things get better on their own so I think you're observing in yourself is a good one to start with to get greater confidence in your body's ability to do things that's really Valley so but this obviously you're not talking about catastrophic injuries just talkin about General Wellness I think even the case of of catastrophic injury this stuff operates I worked a lot with hypnotherapist over the years and one of them at one of my colleagues did a lot of work and training paramedics to be really careful about what you say around unconscious people who've been massively injured you know when that if a if a paramedics takes an automobile accident victim and they're putting them in such as this one's a goner that is a bad thing you know the unconscious mind on and on the other hand you say so

<timemark seconds="1540" />

opposite to a person that you can see cases where you can stop bleeding in unconscious people severely injured just by giving them suggestions yeah

<timemark seconds="1550" />

so when you're saying someone's argon are you trigger stress or you trigger helplessness like what it what is happening in person tell you that you're not going to live that the curse yeah it's like that sometimes your life is hanging on the border of you believing you're going to be okay and you believing you're not going to be okay so you want to be very careful about you know whose hands you place yourself and never want to stay in treatment with a doctor who thinks she can't get better and negative doctor will doctors are just like every other right occupation if you with a really good at it and I'm really concentrating and focusing issues that are half a snack Bowl the ones I train through University of Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine cat at you know we're putting out The Graduate about 1600 Physicians now from very intense training or in practice all over the country teaching other people's a good thing when you say Integrative Medicine when they're in practice are they essentially General Practitioners

<timemark seconds="1610" />

so orthopedic surgeons and their ologist dermatologist anything you can never did and so you try to tend to look at them we teach them all the things I can get in medical school nutrition mindbody interactions with strengths and weaknesses of alternative medicine herbal medicine. They have a bad case of psoriasis medicine for traditional Chinese medicine which often works well and in that dietary change the people on an anti-inflammatory diet use of natural products that reduce inflammation is a wide range of things to choose from and this does not reject conventional treatment you know we may use conventional medication but if you do I recommend using the lowest dose of the least potent agent start off with that and you can ramp off if you need to but a lot of people and me I'm definitely guilty of this they hear terms like holistic or an Eastern medicine or Chinese medicine to go balls

<timemark seconds="1670" />

well I have a good bulshit detector to and so I'm careful about what I you know except and want to know what what do you not buy into like when you see your bullshit detector like wet where you at I'm not I can't see any basis for Crystal healing how about the colonic irrigation people tell you tell you that they see you in a watermelon seeds coming out and you haven't eaten the watermelon in months that's bullshit they've the lining of the GI tract off and is regenerated every 24 hours there's no way that things can get encrusted there that's weird because your body has natural bacteria that you supposed to keep in their right not only keeping their we're finding out that that's like more and more really important determinant of everything of General Health of mental health fascinating

<timemark seconds="1730" />

are the must-have way back that's kind of like you know some wacky idea pump some water so it won't go further in his start as early as 1500 BC Everest papyrus in ancient Egyptian medical document describe the many benefits of colon cleansing in ancient times the practice of cleansing the colon was administered in a river by using a hollow Reed to induce water to flow into the rectum you don't want to drink Downstream of that and you know there's no need to do this what you want to do is make sure the things are going through in the right direction

<timemark seconds="1790" />

tox detox vacation and sell all these products the body has many natural methods of purifying itself and getting rid of things at the other one one is through sweating one is through breathing one is through urination one is through colonic and elimination the liver has an incredible capacity to detoxify it can take no you put something in your body the liver within seconds of seeing a compound that has never seen before can begin making a specific enzyme to take that apart and get rid of it and you can amputate half of the liver and it can regenerate within 36 hours issue that it took a long time I don't know what's really quickly and there's a natural product that you can take the most doctors don't learn about cold milk thistle

<timemark seconds="1850" />

is up liver metabolism so these are all simple ways to increase but the first rule of detoxification I'm sure you can guess you stop putting toxic things in the past and let it Let the Body get yo Pierre Faisal yeah well what would you do when someone's a cigarette smoker you tell them to set a date to quit set a date that's the most important thing because each attempt to create doesn't matter if you succeed it's making the attempt to quit goes into a reservoir motivation that one day we'll be falling off that it's easy and this by the way have it happens with heroin addicts happens with cigarette addicts I've seen many people lifelong cigarette addicts struggle give it up came back one day they wake up and they look at stained fingers or a Dirty Ashtray and it want to do it anymore and it's easy there's no struggle same thing with heroin addict so it has to do with motivation you can't put that into another person in all you can do is arrange circumstances that maybe it'll happen

<timemark seconds="1910" />

the most important thing is to help you to set a date to quit and it doesn't matter if they tell him we said yes it's for real yeah you're so the more like see if you're drunk and you keep falling off the wagon if you just keep making these temps yes now can't really so there's something ramps up in your mind yet it makes it more feasible for you to quit yes and when it when it happens there's no struggle it's not a not it's not an issue just you don't want to do it anymore now what do you do when people come to and they're on antidepressants well I have a book called spontaneous happiness which is about emotional Wellness is a lot there about antidepressants first we don't work so well you know that's very sometimes they work sometimes hard to distinguish them from placebos I know they don't work so well you know what doctors do they add one drug

<timemark seconds="1970" />

horrifying these are like four major mental illness they're not things you just add on to make the antidepressant work better with talked about that one Ad nauseam on this podcast. Because it turned out to be the most prescribed drug in America that I can't believe that that's the sound of the word is that 25% of women between 40 and 50 are on antidepressants in 10% of adults in the in the country a great job of convincing people that ordinary states of sadness or problems of brain biochemistry to be treated with a drug we're not supposed to be happy secondly there's a big problem with a good example most of the medications we use our counteractive know they oppose some process in the bar so when you do that the body pushes back against that that's called homeostasis you know what an easy example you can make

<timemark seconds="2030" />

cuz if you have a stuffed up nose you spray a drug in it that Deccan Jess you miraculous right you can freeze and depending on which drug use two hours for hours at last but when it wears off you have rebound congestion that's worse if you use another dose of the drug then very easy to slide in very easy to slide into a state of dependence on same thing happens with many of these drugs antidepressants they raise serotonin levels in the road Junction The Junction so what is the body going to do if you force an increase in serotonin it's going to make less serotonin and serotonin receptor so if you stay in one of these for any length of time

<timemark seconds="2071" />

when you get off at you're going to be in worse shape than you are to begin with and this is now has a medical name it's called tardive dysphoria meaning lingering bad mood due to the drug so the drug actually prolongs were intensified the depression you may be okay for very short term use of very severe depression but these are not things you want to go on and stay on for length of time what's fascinating to me is when I talk to people that are on them that I want to talk to you like they're on some cancer medication or they are on you know something that cured polio like you did they make it seem like you're insensitive to the possibility there's other Solutions right and there were many other Solutions we have really good evidence for the antidepressant effect of physical activity yes both to prevent and treat yeah we are very good evidence for supplemental fish oil for omega-3 fatty acids to prevent and CBDs well and the microbiome looks like

<timemark seconds="2131" />

goat gets back to information Anna gets back to in an integrative approach and not just relying on a single thing like a pharmaceutical treatment in one form or another and even ones that have struggled we're on one for a while and it stopped working and then they tried another one in there and they're on this weird sort of chemical roller coaster and they reject any possible notion that this other Alternatives especially when you bring up the exercise one right I bring up the exercise 1 to go all this fucking Meatheads Insider size we just stopped and I'm like I'm telling you that we did this thing with my friends called sober October and what we did is no alcohol no anything for the month of October but also we get this fitness challenge and we got really carried away we're competing against each other with his heart rate app so we're working out 3 hours for hours those crazy fools interesting about it to me was not just that your body's hurt of add apps when you force it to work out that many hours but that you

<timemark seconds="2191" />

mood is phenomenal. I felt so good and I was telling everybody if you could take what I like I don't feel that good right now because I was working out 4 hours a day it was it if you could get that in pill form you would take it everyday if there was no side effects because it literally removed anxiety all the internal chatter all the negative chatter it was gone everything seemed amazing true and there are side effects of physical activity or great people that you mentioned anxiety the the by Far and Away the most effective treatment I found for anxiety is simple a simple breathing technique regulating the breath I've seen this work for the most extreme forms of panic disorder and the drugs that we use for anxiety are the worst the benzodiazepines highly addictive mess with your mind I have a good friend who has an issue with anxiety

<timemark seconds="2251" />

Shannon he takes it all the time and when he doesn't take it apparently it has that rebound facts gas right he gets horribly anxious if they are at sack worst addiction and then opiate addiction and how do you feel about psychedelic interventions when it comes to addictions like it seems that we're hearing more more about that I know you have a background in that as well well I'm hearing about the Boga African psychedelic and there are clinics and people using this that clean great success I don't have first-hand experience I only know what I've heard and when I talk to people but sounds most of the psychedelics are so non-toxic so safe and in the right hands I think there's many possibilities for you no good outcomes yeah they've also had some pretty good results

<timemark seconds="2311" />

cigarette cessation with not just a bag of it even went so sorry I've been apparently they had they did a study where they show the difference between someone taking Scylla syban to try to quit smoking cigarettes and some really large number of people I think I was in the neighborhood of 80% quit and then over the course of x amount of years they were still at 60%. Comebacks great but with other methods did the never was much smaller someone 15% after six years a lot of us went back to it what do you make of the microdosing phenomenon mean this is pretty astounding to see the sentient jump all the way then I need to see why you want to medicate everyday that's kind of how I feel I'm just joking around I think I know people who have experienced seems pretty severe benefits of it especially people that

<timemark seconds="2371" />

weren't doing so good health-wise there and you know we're just really kind of feeling down and depressed and Allison Outlook radically changed particular Scylla syban microdosing I know a lot of people were doing that yes I am I have a lot of hope that Oregon becomes the first state to make it gets close to legalize Scylla syban that'll be a big one for getting helped and a lot of the people that are terminal are having some really amazing alleviation of anxiety and an understanding that it was going to be okay and just I think between friends and do just that. Just the camaraderie it sort of when you have these group experiences together like there's some incredible benefits to that in terms of like reinforcing community and a civilization the way we feel about each other side from the psychological emotional benefits I think you would be fascinated by some of the things

<timemark seconds="2431" />

but I've observed and written about of real physical benefits of psychedelics and just tell you a couple in my late twenties I did a lot of experiences in the 70s with the LSD mostly with Allstate I had a lifelong allergy to cats if I can't get near me my eyes would itch my nose would run if a cat licked me I get hives would lick me so I always do know avoided them and then let him touch me so I took LSD with a group of friends on a Springdale who your Virgina fabulous and I was outside running around having a lot of fun and in the middle is a cat jumped into my lap and I had a moment of like trying to defend myself and I thought it silly you know and I relaxed play with the cat had no allergic reaction and never did Ever After instant disappearance of an allergy that have been there all my life what would be the physiological mechanism for something that's a very profound mind-body interaction that we know that allergies are influenced by that because you can show

<timemark seconds="2491" />

a person allergic to roses a plastic Rose and we'll have an allergy so this is so there's a learned component to Allergy that can be unlearned but have a nice to them maybe a year later same thing as LSD in the spring I had also grown up with very fair skin and was told I couldn't get tan and we still go down to the Jersey Shore I can't remember innumerable times you know gets getting second degree burn sheets of skin peeling off Noxzema at night it wouldn't have sunscreen in those days so well I just accepted that's all I was so high on LSD lying out naked in my Woods in my home in Virginia and the sun was up there and I thought this is ridiculous you know I should not be afraid of the Sun the next day I got tan and I have ever sent now that's a little more and I'm not quite sure where the mechanism there but it's pretty amazing cuz if you're outside long enough

<timemark seconds="2551" />

I was out in good time you know I would have I would have normally have at least I would have had you in my usual reaction but then my skin got tan and never had in my life so what are you suggesting happened

<timemark seconds="2562" />

again that you know there must be a way in which the nervous system influences melanocytes which you're the queen of the South pigment cells in the body that can either extend their you know projections with pigment granules so the nervous system controls that in the mind-connection nervous system but what about someone who's like ridiculously Fair like what about someone who lives in Scotland Clinic opens I would have liked to know but they'll be an allergy program right you go in on the first day you take a full dose of something and you're exposed to the allergen and you know magic happens when you come in for 10 sessions with a decreasing dose and at some point you're not getting your just getting a placebo you don't know when that is and people are trained to lose their allergies I do the same thing with the Sun Tanning maybe not with people from Scotland because they've got fewer pigments and I'll tell you one more from this. I told you I was playing with yoga there was one pause

<timemark seconds="2622" />

I couldn't do the plow where you line your back and try to touch your toes behind your head I got to where I could get my toes to a foot from the floor and I had excruciating pain in my neck and I as much as I tried that I made no progress so I was on the verge of giving up I thought I was too old to 28 so again one in an LSD State my body was feeling totally last I got to try that so I'm lowering my feet I thought I had a foot to go and they touch the ground I couldn't believe it oh wow fantastic the next to the ground had excruciating pain in my neck but now I knew was possible before that I didn't know was possible so knowing it was possible I was motivated to keep at it and in a few weeks I was able to do it if I had not had that experience I would have given up so I think this is the magic of these things they can show you possibilities they don't necessarily teach you how to how to maintain them but they can show you the things are possible you'll never believe what didn't even seem like it was just showing you a possibility

<timemark seconds="2682" />

it was actually showing your capability capable of moving it before and it was because of your own tension and worrying probably learned patterns of tension that is build up on my wife and maybe some because of the conscious or the Psychedelic State rather do some alleviation of tension

<timemark seconds="2705" />

well you do you definitely sense that with marijuana particularly edible marijuana you can really get good stretching and with edible marijuana it's almost like you I mean I hate to use certain terms it just like trigger people's bullshit alarms but there's a you you can you can feel more of the muscle feel more of what what it's doing right where is you know I've been involved in martial arts and Athletics now in up my life so I have a good awareness of my body but it's way better when I yeah metal edible edible marijuana like I feel I understand like I can practice moves better leave you certainly kicking techniques I I'm better if I'm more in tune with it how everything's working together where is sometimes I can do it if I'm sober but it's I'm almost like there's a prophylactic tween me and my body numbness to it that gets removed

<timemark seconds="2765" />

edible marijuana gravel and I could not walk on that Barefoot it really hurt my feet and if I even if I stood and I'm dancing my feet on MDMA I was able to like dance on those stones no pain but the interesting things there were no marks on my feet so the pain is easy to figure out how that happens what are what's happening that you know you don't get a dent I mean it seems to me if your mind is out of the way maybe little muscles there can are free to press back with just the amount of force to neutralize the pressure it's like if your mind is not interfering I think the body has amazing capabilities my definitely think you can mind fuck yourself right I'm you can definitely think I know God is

<timemark seconds="2825" />

add some things aren't nearly as bad as you are making them out to be

<timemark seconds="2829" />

so I could get some I'm with you on everything except the tanning but you're supposed to just go but I'm not going to explain this to myself because I want that I have no experience of I'm always willing to entertain the possibility but then I got to experience it for myself I'm willing to entertain a dependent upon who I'm talking to cuz there's some people are just crazy I am absolutely aware that there's some component there's something about the mind and the way the Mind interacts with matter and with life that has a profound effect on your body and it would be really nice if we were all better at controlling that

<timemark seconds="2889" />

one of the insights that I've had in psychedelic States is that everything is conscious that Consciousness permeates everything that you know I I I feel whatever in me that my Consciousness is also and Roxanne in plants and then animals that there's some Universal something out there and it's there are two in a really different ways of looking at reality one is the materialist one which of the Consciousness is a product of rain biochemistry and electricity in that is dominant in science today the other is that the brain is a receiving apparatus for Consciousness and that Consciousness is primary maybe existed before matter may be organized matter into forms that are more and more able to experience themselves I don't know I don't think it's a way to prove one or the other it just that for me the conscious is primary one is more fun and makes life more interesting I'm sure you're familiar with Rupert sheldrake

<timemark seconds="2949" />

is good friend very very interesting guy he has an idea that everything has memory bright some people would not want to live in a haunted house if someone was murdered in the house it would retain some memory of these atrocities and that you would somehow or another interact with that if you were in the house

<timemark seconds="2973" />

so like spaces my dad is not a very he's not a woo woo kind of guy but he went to Gettysburg and he was telling me that when he was at Gettysburg that it's just he felt profound sadness and he's like it just seems like it's just in the ground like the whole area goes I don't know how to describe it but I wanted to get the fuck out of there like just just being around this area where the Battle of taking place so many people that died I said you could feel it I don't know if I buy the anybody has experienced I'm willing to entertain it but it also could be you know like he he got lucky and didn't get drafted during Vietnam and it's probably in his head that if he did get drafted he might have died over there and for what reason he would have got this life you would you know what is the person then think about these young man that died in the same thing

<timemark seconds="3033" />

for some war that didn't make any sense of why the fuck are they even fighting it like who the who why is it why is that and then having all these people died together in this one horrible battle in this one place and eat you know it happened he was playing a game on his mind but no Joe there is a science of swearing a sign of your brain that produces swear words is not the part of the brain that ordinary language really interesting you know we have two language centers in our left frontal cortex people that have strokes that damage them off and lose language completely but they can still swear no swearing is coming from somewhere else it may be coming from the right hemisphere but it's also coming from deeper centers in the brain that connect to the limbic system and

<timemark seconds="3093" />

amygdala and that connects to the involuntary nervous system so here's a couple interesting facts no swearing is associated with sweating increase sweating so you should be dripping with sweat I'm a comedian swearing increases pain phones have people stick their hand in a bucket of ice and water and you see how long they can keep it there the people who say fuck shit can people there much longer than people who are not allowed to swear noises with no swearing specifically so they've tried noises and swearing so it made you know when you if you're hammering a nail you should use one of those words that's a good strategy that's interesting because I almost always do that if I heard something especially a finger slammed in car door

<timemark seconds="3153" />

sing it's, there's a different part of the brain has different emotional content language yes I'm a big fan of the squares about the science of swearing they were no longer taboo with the same area I think they wouldn't I remember there was an episode of I don't remember what television show but it was on CBS at the end of the show and essentially they were saying shit happens and it was a big deal I'll bet it was a big deal that they wanted to be able to say shit happen huh and apparently they pulled this off and they got it through and it was like a 10 p.m. show so it was okay and was Eleven by the time is it shit and I remember seeing what a strange sort of like how many people are involved in this sort of dance like how many lawyers and executives

<timemark seconds="3213" />

it's very strange that this one word would everybody knows the word right side of a kind of facilitated by one specific part of the brain and is that because like I don't swear words are taboo words associated with or with bodily ask the freak people out so but so there's both there's a psychological social aspect to it but there's also a neurological aspect to it when the words like some words for some people like I remember when I was a kid I lived in Florida for a little bit and I said hell once and in Florida in the 1970s hell was a swear yeah I don't know I mean I came from New Jersey to visit San Francisco and then also I said how

<timemark seconds="3273" />

who the fuck are you people talking about you guys have different swear word that was not Taboo 2 you would that same area of your brain I don't know this is there has not been a lot of research it hasn't been taken seriously but that's all interesting questions I should have some I mean if you're really super conservative person through a lot of words that are off the table but if you are a far more but you know just loose with your language you can shit this and guess God damn it you know that would be nothing like God damn it would be just like shocks but there's someone God damn it would be like a really bad different parts of the brain would be activated by that versus if you said it it would be not that big a deal but if someone is like super conservative they say that even more

<timemark seconds="3333" />

think that that is a universal that made it seem to be emotional impact that your first language does that make sense what is so fun when you learn Spanish that makes sense and you can do them on television to say a lot of Spanish to English speaking TV and everybody's free language as they all have worse every language Universal doubt that would at least my brain seemed to indicate that there's like some use for that yes

<timemark seconds="3393" />

sing of modulating pain what is a social bond No forming some Community I can't talk to you right you too much work right you know I know exactly what you're talking to someone and every other word like I know exact Hold Your Hand dancing this Garden it's to me also like I hang around with a lot of people that swear a lot because I hang around with professional Comedians and Fighters and is a lot of swashbuckling freewheeling type of individuals involved in those Pursuits and some studies suggesting that swearing is becoming more frequent in our society at War public I don't know what to try and I'm not sure anybody knows why but I mean nobody would have been you don't want the air like you are

<timemark seconds="3453" />

1 years ago that's true but that is specifically because the internet server lyrebird Ayisha yeah yeah yeah but even trying to figure out how to modulate this and how to handle it and they'll never handle it now it seems like the genie is out of the bottle right act like yeah I think ultimately you find what you enjoy in the best way to find with you what you enjoy is people actually doing what they want to do and then you figure it out exactly that seems to be what's happening in the world of the internet and podcast and stuff like that

<timemark seconds="3485" />

it's also the access right like a person like you you could just put together a podcast and if people find it interesting if it resonates you could get $100,000 I don't know where at least a hundred thousand a radio show hundred thousand people listening that's a lot of damn people a thousand people a day did you like holy shit is a successful business but you can be doing that just from your office just put together a laptop and a microphone and no distribution whatsoever in terms of no string of Executives and gigantic Corporation behind you don't have alcohol and nobody telling you what you can say that you never got out of before In-N-Out this is I've been involved in Show Business for many years but only this kind of stuff for 9 from doing this podcast and what I've seen with this is like

<timemark seconds="3545" />

what's unusual I think what resonates with people is that there isn't anybody else there's no group of people that saying Andrew can you stop saying this or let's let's concentrate on died and in the polls are showing that people like this and you know you have breaks in between where the commercials are playing they come to you with notes and they tell you they thought that stuff just seems to somehow or another ruin his natural interaction that we have each other

<timemark seconds="3574" />

now forgot like you the internet is I would think that with some of your more controversial ideas like this is the way you could really are them out and long-form because if you like a lot of doctors they don't want to open their mind to anything outside of what they're what their practice notice out there if I'm not on my life but do you don't you find that it's more not not just accepted but it people are more interested in it now because of the internet yeah yeah absolutely because I've heard about you for many many years but which sort of ramped up over the last decade or so bright

<timemark seconds="3619" />

yeah because of the internet right now because people have this when I look at this stuff like you know all the stuff about pot and psychedelics placebos I was saying the stuff in the 1970s in the first book The Natural mind was published in 1972 would argue that everybody has an innate drive to alter their Consciousness drugs are one way of doing it I did the first human experiments with pot that where ever done with the under double-blind conditions I-84 People BET me you couldn't do it nobody has ever done this you know the oldest marijuana was becoming such a big thing and nobody there were no experiments like what would what kind of experience I will be your friend if I just wanted to show that you could give it to uman subject in the lab and get away with it cuz people thought you know the FTC

<timemark seconds="3679" />

for to speak so there be no expectations everyone said this is terribly know they're going to turn it to heroin addicts from giving them stuff like that anyway I just wanted to see basic stuff like doesn't dilate the pupils of the eyes because cops were busting people know they say their eyes are dilated must be high on marijuana need search put marijuana doesn't why should we showed doesn't dilate the pupils of the eyes I took to chat tested blood sugar cause people to the reason from get hungry is because blood sugar drop has no effect on blood sugar we showed that the veto people who had never had marijuana before in a lab you could show slight decrease in performance and motor function and cognitive function but people who were regular use of it you couldn't show that they have adapted to that is that I think the people that are not regular users are freaking out because they're they're nervous

<timemark seconds="3739" />

it's the big one to me with with physical movement cuz they want to you know test drivers and also today. Things for marijuana Mike this is not alcohol your tongue out a completely different thing if I had a choice of being a passenger with these drivers are they which one I would take a person who had never use marijuana to just smoked a person who was easier marijuana and it just smoke would have never driven by a person who is a user regular marijuana and I practice driving High and a person with any amount of alcohol in their system I take the third as the best bet yes it's everyday experiences a novel experience and if you're accustomed to it than just like you would go this is my normal world had for many people you have to learn to get high you have to learn to associate the subtle physical cues with the altered state that's a common thing people could feel nothing the first time they try

<timemark seconds="3799" />

yeah you do hear that right but I don't think they know what the fuk there talks about like throw your eyes fuck when you did these experiments what did you have to clear these with the FTA did you would not believe I have to do I have to get permission from the FBI that I couldn't do it unless I first got permission from the old Federal Bureau of Narcotics which is the treasury guys will give you permission 1 for yesterday to give you permission so big play that off then I have to get permission from the state of Massachusetts from two agencies there and there were two universities involve Harvard University Boston University so coordinating all this stuff with unbelievable and then once that all the approvals came in I had to get the pot and there was no legal source of it so I thought that they had confiscated in Texas they brought it over today at the latest so long I didn't even know that time to do the experiment cuz I was going to graduate anyway they brought the stuff on a Friday afternoon

<timemark seconds="3859" />

it was shit I'm it was brown dry looks like you've been sitting in a warehouse for years and smoke it no effect whatever I called the agent that I've dealt with I said this stuff is no good how do you know you have enough time to run in the experiment so I said I looked at it under the microscope and there is no resin on it so they grumbled and they gave me other stuff which was passable complicated stuff his we always used to hear when we were kids about government weed the government lead was the good weed do you were the one that was latter one that moment when research got going and the US government started a pot farm in Mississippi to provide proper research which was much better than it was only a handful of people that were under these experiments Resort as they have with psychedelics know that slowly changing now you know Rick Strassman sure when he was doing that book DMT The Spirit Molecule and he did all those tests with

<timemark seconds="3919" />

people that was really groundbreaking stop because the University of New Mexico and they were able to document the similarities of government approval which I thought was really fascinated by the fact that they did it and with the informations out and then there's been like very little movement in that direction it's kind of just like okay now we know but luck everybody's fine it's a lot of benefit do we do want to act on this like you know it takes decades right on all along it was from her to look for negative effects you know nobody who wanted to look for positive effects got permission and funding that's interesting so you have to kind of frame The Proposal in a way these kids are fun

<timemark seconds="3979" />

a lot of problems yeah there's been some noise about decriminalizing decriminalizing it federally which is like Step 1 against a wall with a group called now he won't screw on the chief science officer Maui Hawaii operation over there why how's it work for medical marijuana for recreational have to be

<timemark seconds="4008" />

you know what that's okay the way they're getting a little Alia Bhatt there's this specified conditions why he's not is more uptight than a lot of other state but our licenses for Maui County which includes Maui Molokai and Lanai so people from all the time and I can come to Maui to buy product in our dispensary but they can't take it back because the waters between the island or federal throw it still have to cross the water that's great what is your really sick like what if you have cancer or something like that well on your okay so can you grow it no you can only grow it if you have a license in the only licenses for Maui we got to change this California was really ridiculous when they were doing medical like you just basically go in there like I can't sleep

<timemark seconds="4068" />

are you okay it's not like I had friends that had like long elaborate excuses they planned out like you know I was I was in car accident while 6 and 4 to go to bed at night I have this horrible dreams the only thing that helps ease marijuana and I'm just trying to feed my family that they were going to stop stop stop joke was that if you can't get a license for marijuana Chicago to a hospital immediately not a user pot and I was heavily in my early life a friend of my doctor colleagues in San Francisco sent me some samples of stuff that it come from a medical dispensary in San Francisco and he wanted me to try them so one of them was a some concentrated oil it came in a little syringe and dad had a very elaborate nicely printed brochure with it that describe the use of the pain and the

<timemark seconds="4128" />

said you should start with an amount the size of half a grain of rice take it orally so afraid of getting too high on so I went to sleep woke up about an hour later in full-blown delirium I mean visual hallucinations and get out of bed you know I was a mobile I had burning thirst I couldn't get up to get a glass of water I had a friend staying and a Gasthaus I couldn't call for help I laid and it kept increasing your depth over four hours it got stronger and stronger and when is it going to end anyway it lasted 12 hours for about 24 hours after I mean it said the directions that start with this amount of work up from there a total Airhead driving on the streets

<timemark seconds="4188" />

yeah there's people little squirt that whole thing in there, right

<timemark seconds="4193" />

I'm sure you know so I know a lot of them because of the the response of the body so much different than the smoking at school by long length of time it takes only Cuts Like lighting the firework and the few go back and try to light it again and I'm sure you've heard the recording of the police officers who stole the pot from the kids and then ate it and then called nine-one-one and themselves that they they ate pot brownies in their call 911 like I think we think we're dying x movie real slowly I think we're dead

<timemark seconds="4237" />

so stupid it's good for kids to hear because you realize I called cops are just people all right sounds like my brother my brother is crazy people that get high but it did the effect of the edible can be pretty pretty fucking profound in this area in particular like Hollywood have some Preposterous THC level I don't imagine I mean that the regulations now that it's legal statement but when it was only you could get these insane concoctions stars of death you ever heard of a started that hang out with free 400 is hundreds of em Joey would eat like three or four of them would just throw them he's a he's got

<timemark seconds="4297" />

insane tolerance guys give it all this stuff however I am delighted to see our society finally coming to better terms we asked me to eat the the word cannabis the same word as canvas wall canvas Sales & Rope used to be made from hemp species names that even means useful useful hemp it's really useful he was his one planet that hat provides an edible seed and edible oil of high-quality fiber a medicine and an intoxicant that's a lot of ways for a plant to be useful we have been very stupid and I relationship with that plant cannabis the dog in the Plant World dogs long ago made a decision to co-evolve with us they threw their evolutionary lot in with humans cannabis did the same thing you can't unravel the early Botanical history of cannabis cuz this far back in history is we go it's always associated with

<timemark seconds="4357" />

open settlements that plant was nothing other than to be with us at the service and we have been so stupid we've let a billion dollar in tourism industry in hemp textiles go to China we've let a million dollar industry an edible hemp products go to Canada and we have ignored this potential for medicine I'm really hoping that things are going to change and turn the wheel cultivation of Hamp you know I'm one of the owners of on it and we sell hemp protein in one of those what's going to happen I'm so hopeful let's go to does change it is it's fascinating also how well the propaganda worked against it and how long even in defiance of all the facts I have to tell you when I did those pot experiments with 1968 I predicted the years

<timemark seconds="4417" />

it's a matter of getting the truth out there what they want to believe and don't believe that they don't want to believe in it's rude it's totally irrational it's also an excellent example of the contradictions in our society the difference between something that's accurate and something that's perceived out and we have this perception of Maryland and sometimes they have perceptions based on experiences like you might meet some pot does to you also they was the association's of pot because they've been back there and you know when the 50 60s it was associated with Mexican migrant workers with a black Jazz musicians in the South and then with radicals and hippie so all scary people to mainstream you know middle class white Society dated by William Randolph Hearst and Harry anslinger and the Reefer Madness filmed

<timemark seconds="4477" />

it's amazing how something that was terrifying to someone back then it's so silly today when you watch reformatted say it's really funny and at the same time most dangerous drugs that are out there with alcohol well how about fentanyl making it more more words weren't killing people quick enough that we needed to make some ridiculously potent versions of it and apparently they're proving something that's even more powerful than friends but you know on a physiological level opioids are not that bad for your body the worst effect of being addicted to an opioid overtime is chronic constipation minutes annoying but that's not like cirrhosis of the liver regeneration of the nervous system fit overdoses overdoses of course they kill

<timemark seconds="4537" />

all the people who have been addicted to opioids who been able to get legal supplies and use them as sensibly there healthy I have heard about that went in terms of regular heroin use yep that I had a friend who was a longshoreman and this is like when I was a kid he was explaining to me how this guy that he worked with would get a bag of heroin everyday at lunch and he would shoot it in his car and he just sit in his car during lunch hour and then when the time was up to go back to work I was like what he said he would do that everyday but do it all the time right now and figure out how to do it in and not there so I can agree on Hopkins University in the early 1900s he invented the local anesthesia and to get a great guy he started using cocaine and injected self-injected cocaine

<timemark seconds="4597" />

and not a good thing and it is you know his behavior got really bad not good so at some point his kidnapped and put it took him out of Yacht for several weeks and he came back supposedly cured had a long life as a very successful productive surgeon and only after his death was it revealed that what happened on that trip was it they had gotten them off cocaine and onto intravenous morphine for the rest of his life he was an intravenous morphine user did not in any way interfere with his health or productivity I would assume that if you doing that every day you're going to run into issues with your veins well yeah presumably he know we knew how to rotate around this time but I wouldn't want to do that but there it is but the point is that you know that it's a whole different game from alcohol and tobacco a whole different game but it's the social toxicity of it it said that the people are buying illegal in pure materials in

<timemark seconds="4657" />

dosing and so forth It's not the the Nate pharmacological nature the drug what's been disturbing to me as a person as an observer is watching people who get injured get hooked on it particularly pills it seems that my good friend Brandon he had his nose broken and his nose fixed and they put them on pills and before he knew and he was taking those pills everyday for months and months and months in his friends eventually just took him out of his medicine cabinet and they just made an intervention the realization is that you cannot manage chronic pain solely with use of opioids treatment that use uses different modalities could be everything from acupuncture yoga mind-body stuff diet and that all Hospital. State of Oregon a couple years ago passed an integrative pain management initiative saying that all pain chronic pain

<timemark seconds="4717" />

integrative and they listed the different modalities they left out Mind Body medicine which to me is one of the most important Mind Body medicine know on any sort of a report that seems like that's one Like Cocaine what kind of but look you know I study I'm with you yeah I studied hypnosis after I got out of my medical training one of the most interesting courses ever took in the literature on hypnosis you can take a person deeply hidden faces got good trans capacity touch them with a finger that you represent to be a piece of hot metal and they get a blister and you can take the same person in touch with a piece of hot metal and tell them it's cold and they don't get a blister well-known phenomena I'm taking a hot piece of metal that she's been someone that did not going to burn the I didn't burn

<timemark seconds="4777" />

like almost let's try it I'll put you under like it's one of those things like the walking on coals to absolutely. I've done a number of times but if it was with Cole you know it before but yes I'll tell you what my experience was the first time I tried it I was with a group of baby 40 people and it was a the standard length of the fire walk with about 12 ft above the hot fire was Mesquite that was in my yard in Tucson in them and the guy came in it was really the days of fire walking and he had this long for our thing to get people ready I was not in the right mental state when I did it and my experience was it felt fucking hot and I got to the end of it

<timemark seconds="4837" />

I like the number of points that really burned and I had blisters the next day and most people that have walked that night it look like they were not in the right mental state that I saw a few people who strolled across at that look they were in some interesting altered state so I wanted to try it again next time I did I shouldn't have done it I was with a guy who was a real jerk who thought himself is that you always a self buy a group small group it was a short maybe eight foot cooler bed of coals and I got significant burns from that so you getting annoyed so you're out of your mindset right and I burned my face I said I'm not going to do this again and then a friend of mine was doing some intensive workshop with Tony Robbins in Christ they were going to do try to set a record for the longest firework done in America so he I'm going to bed of coals

<timemark seconds="4897" />

hot and said he had like a tube of African drummers and people are dancing and Romeo's like midnight and people are getting in line to walk and I said I'm not going to do this not to be by Family self get her going up there and I was right there taxi the shoulders as you're ready it felt like walking through crunchy croutons there was no sensation if he I walked slowly I kind of wiggled my feet in the things and when I got to the end of it I felt so high I was like on acid I had an interview rushes to my body I had nothing on my feet so on a much shorter cooler walk those coals conducted just fine and you don't want this one it's a mind-body thing it's not about the conductivity of the cold with some fugazi Kohl's in the heat was amazed to know the Tony Robbins one that's what's really interesting is recently they've developed this issue with people trying to take selfies while they're walking across the coals burning their feet

<timemark seconds="4957" />

I'm awake significant issue because it didn't happen till like within the last time ever heard of that I think that would get you right out of the proper stay there was a big article about it in their feet up well-deserved you really think that you have the ability to mitigate the amount of effect that you can take you can absorb energy and let it flow through your body rather than getting blocked in the tissues I wear causes damage and I've seen this in in other situations as well and I think the problem is ordinarily our mind is in the way of that and and does not let the body freely do that

<timemark seconds="5005" />

and I think that applies to things like getting hit really hard heat getting hit really hard getting loving someone hit you as hard as they can with something that would cause damage and it doesn't know that's crazy no it's not I've experienced I'm sure you have other real scientific studies that show that nobody sees nobody walking you know the usual scientific explanation we shouldn't talk about this until they do do studies cuz it seems so simple to do these studies and I'm not playing for a second I think if I hit somebody if you get Deontay Wilder to punch you out, experience points involved in car accident don't get injured okay but do you know why because they're totally relax yes but that has nothing to do with some altered state of consciousness is not allowing the injury to actually thermostat intention of falling

<timemark seconds="5065" />

you hurt yourself because you're defending yourself you're right right your body is better off giving into the old saying it's the same thing with the fire they can't be that's a different thing cuz you're not tense it's on the surface of your skin which is causing the he know I don't get what is in your nervous system which is not let it not able to absorb that thermal energy and brown started running a burn you, I will try it certainly you can mitigate the sensation of pain and I don't believe that you can do anything about the actual physiological change to a hot piece of metal interacting with the tissue of your skin I just like the steak does not know it's being cooked it's just kidding cooked you're going to get cooked you are a meat I just don't I don't buy that I'll show you some of these studies on hypnosis his doctor's right now going Yak you tell him Joe Rogan this is

<timemark seconds="5125" />

God says well I believe that hypnosis I do believe that but I absolutely believe you can achieve different states of Mind where you feel things differently you or your concentration your relaxation is in a different state your mind set is in a different state I do not believe that you could change the physiological nature of your body's ability to absorb punishment like a punch or kick song let's set some studies absurd we're all bored I'm all for it. He's already done talked about these things I know but this is a significant metal rod the bread out of the fire and touch someone's skin they're in the right state of mind you don't burn them

<timemark seconds="5179" />

Toby giant I'll send you some literature on hypnosis that shows his gun I'm sure someone wrote some shit down I'm sure I want to see actual real studies all right I want to see and I want it I mean in this day and age is no reason that videotape this world woo woo people are healers and a lot of black people like to bring up and it when when you press them on it there's no evidence for it and it's like well anecdotal evidence well I've heard well I work with a Healer and he tells me like I do you know what the literal meaning of anecdote is means unpublished it does not mean stupid experiments so you go ahead and do that

<timemark seconds="5235" />

you got a report that hot piece of metal in your skin is always in Acura it's most certainly accurate many times does likelihood that it's not that it is but that gives you hypothesis test sure it's just not good enough to stay something that doesn't make sense chemically physiologically it doesn't make sense but I told you about my experience with song and so often something happened in my body that would be interesting if there was some sort of change so you are and they're controlled you know there are melanocytes are related the neurons and their their influence by nerve connections so it

<timemark seconds="5295" />

simply perfect possible that mine through the nervous system changes the behavior of melanocytes sort of like how your body can ramp up adrenaline delanges yeah that doesn't seem like outside the realm of possibility it seems like obviously some people I first said it was outside the realm of possibility outside but sounds crazy but I mean it seems like that would be something also that would really warrant study absolutely I see those poor pasty ass motherfukers out there on the beach the right way you imagine if you just told people that lives like a meditation and then you just get a nice tan autoimmune issues like I have that I have Vitiligo so that is like I have white spots on my hands where I don't get any pigment fix that my brain

<timemark seconds="5355" />

to see if you an influence that through hypnosis or through guided imagery to see if you can change it in any way I don't know hypnosis and guided imagery yeah there to mind body techniques I did read once that there was this I think it was a young man who had some awful one of those awful wart diseases and there's one called ichthyosis which is like the whole told him his arm that one arm was going to write short and it just like I remember that eliminated all the warts on their OneAmerica yeah and they couldn't figure out how or why and they couldn't recreate it

<timemark seconds="5404" />

Sela Ward stuff that's very well-documented you know MN wart cures there's so many different work you are some of that quite funny you know you have to have to cut a particular plans under the full moon and rub it invariably but the wart falls off the next morning and when you compare that to the way we deal with warts medically we burn them all freeze them off cut them off in most of the time we do that they grow back and multiple clusters when they get when the mind gets rid of them through this method they're gone so we want to find out how to make that more time yeah that's real I mean this is this is actual real documented science that is what is so interesting to me about the placebo effect is that it is a real thing that your mind has this capability of healing itself and is very very powerful way but we don't exactly know how to turn it on or off right and they can do the opposite to theirs a phenomenon called Voodoo death where in the societies were there

<timemark seconds="5464" />

Witch Doctor shamans a malevolent witch doctor can curse a person and the person goes home lies in bed stops eating Andover days a week ties so what more could you ask of in the way of a mind-body a fact about the curse of Lil B no no no no by Lil B the rapper he put a curse on boys basketball team

<timemark seconds="5487" />

they're talking shit about him she put a curse on them and they could win a goddamn game how would you say spiritual very positive mostly black real love oriented guy but quesadilla put a hex on dude when he puts a hex on you got a real problem on your taxes them will be put set hex on you like damn it and then he releases the hex on the lips. And when he lifts them everything goes back to normal, right this is weird man this is weird side cuz everyone's aware when Lil B puts a curse on you and when it when he does people are called know I can't believe this like the idea of curses like the dude you know of voodoo curse her Gypsy curse on you that is a

<timemark seconds="5547" />

that's a documented thing as well write the people that can believe that something is wrong with them and then they start mine yeah fukin themselves into this terrible State and then they start screwing things up yeah I started it is Kevin Durant says I tried to listen to Lil B my mind wouldn't let me do it can't believe this guy's relevant and a little baby was like a rat will never win the title after he said Lil B is a wack rapper the base God's curse hashtag the base God's curse on Durant and then you always signs as these tweets Lil B

<timemark seconds="5585" />

but it works it works Kevin Duran is sit at home right now think of the millions will be must have cost them those years it will be I'm fucked over in the corner

<timemark seconds="5604" />

that I mean I think the opposite is true too so someone could put blessings on you like there was a fighter that we had in here the other day Deontay Wilder who's the WBC heavyweight champ of the world and he said that from the time he was a little boy his grandmother had him convinced that he was like an anointed one that he was special and that she would always say that to his parents like you know don't you hit him like this one special you know he's going to raise everybody up and they turned out to be like one of the great heavyweight champions ever in terms of his records for D&L with 39 Knockouts me so phenomenally successful fighter and in his mind he believes that he has some like magic property or that there's something to him he's a ridiculous knockout artist obviously there's a lot of physiological aspects of that he's a big long tall guy with crazy knockout power you can't fake power you to have it or you don't but he's got it and he's got this weird confidence to he got to wonder how much of them actually is operating under this idea that his grandmother

<timemark seconds="5664" />

was right about him having some magical properties until he goes through life with his vision powerful Deontay Wilder's afraid of the way when you present a treatment to a patient your belief in the treatment as of as a practitioner catalyzes the patient's believe that the best way I can do that as if I give a patient something that I've tried myself and I know from my own experience that it works and then I can present it in a way with my confidence and that increases the patient's confidence and increases the likelihood of a favorable outcome even controversial therapies yes and even the fact of the drug and then there's a Halo

<timemark seconds="5724" />

belief affect and you know an interesting phenomenon is that there's a famous saying in medicine that you should use a new remedy as much as possible before it loses the power to heal and this is a common experience the drugs work best near the time of their introduction that's the case of diet is what we're absolutely and the longer they're around you what I think what happens is people have faith in new things so there's a big Kayla placebo effect that overtime that shrinks and it leaves the stuff on its own with may not be very impressive this is often the case of people take out a radical diet like on opposite ends of the spectrum whether it's a carnivore diet how do we how do we find the big problem in science and medicine is it we don't believe in the mind I know that's what I was saying earlier when you were talking about mine it's not Material you know it's not

<timemark seconds="5784" />

that this is the problem when you're talking about mind-body interactions with warts yours was here affects your talking about a non material cause of a physical event and that is not allowed in the materialistic Paragon that Dominic science when we observed the Dogma is the cause has to be physical when you talk about a non-physical cause a physical scientist to now that's really unfortunate because we know so much about how attitude does shaped the way your body reacts to things going back to the back pain to me that you can't separate the mind and body there two poles of the same thing if the placebo effect is real it's documented yeah it's documented so obviously something is going on with the way you feel about things and think about things that is having an actual physiological effect of something happening to your body because the way you're thinking about right now

<timemark seconds="5844" />

the one of the things that has made this if suddenly of interest in the medical world is that we now have these techniques like functional MRIs pet scans living brains and you can show that the placebo response is associated with particular activity in certain brain centers that has made it real for people that I didn't believe in it yes right look there's a medically documented there's something that you can hook into you can you can put on a scale of the brain is responsible for the placebo effect will again it's probably use some of these deep brain centers that the same ones involved in swimming some hearing you know that the same thing it's coming from the Kinect to emotional read you know to emotion

<timemark seconds="5893" />

yeah the ability to turn it on and off consciously and willing ways is tricky over the years was healing shrines in the world like Lord because there's two interesting facts about that over the years the Catholic church has accepted very few healings as genuine that are have like full medical documentation and some of them are quite spectacular like miraculous disappearance of widely disseminated cancer no native of Lord has ever been cured and the chances that a person is going to be healed their explain Lord this is a place a place in France where you know a you know a child saw visions of the Virgin Mary and the anyway it's growing up into a is a grotto and you know it's been one major Catholic shrine and has a reputation for healing in thousands and thousands of people over the years of going there it was I said very you know there's relatively few reported healings that have been.

<timemark seconds="5953" />

document medically but no native of Lord has ever been healed and the their stomach hold the Lord phenomenon which is fascinating that the chances that a person is going to be healed at Lord or a place like that is directly proportional to the length of the journey travel together I have heard that so the length of the journey is is an investment of belief right so you're projecting onto the plate play something you get it back that seems like that could essentially work with any very very difficult absolute Vision Quest tied up the loose on it looking for something and have to earn it yeah yeah after year at to be fully invested that be something going on to mine that has you convinced this is a real fact about the power is not of the place the powers and you know in here

<timemark seconds="6000" />

and you're projecting it onto that but man would it be better if you didn't have to go all the way to the great and how do you how do you get that going and I want to go to Lord but what should I do well in your advantage of this function of visualization guided imagery seem to work on something and have it become real guided imagery now is there a specific you know if there's like transcendental medication is booty you know you sit with a practitioner and they help you explore your mental imagery and may give you specific kinds of images to work with depending on the condition that you're dealing with

<timemark seconds="6048" />

I would think knowing the fact that we we have real evidence of placebo effect works why isn't there more study done to try or more thought and more more people that are trying to emphasize this ability of the. It's up against this problem we don't believe in non-physical causation of physical events because we do believe in a placebo effects like everybody says that it's just a placebo right but we're not using it right we should be using it should be is them if the meat of medicine we want to make it happen more the time God damn it it's just that we're so flawed in our approach it's really interesting it's like the human body and the human mind is such an incredibly complicated biological entity write our ability to consciously be aware

<timemark seconds="6108" />

care of our our our life our position in the world are mortality in significance of us in the greater scale there right now all the time but I don't have any users manual right exactly where this incredible machine that can invent nuclear bombs and satellites and especially not in how to manage the body with the mind if you think about whatever million people have in this country how many of those people could guide you towards a proper integration of mind and body and a positive way of interfacing with reality that's beneficial to you physically mentally spiritually

<timemark seconds="6164" />

not many with all these human beings and essentially most of them trying to improve in some way to fail on diets boy would like to get to know you got people that you know fail at school why I wish I could smart after I graduate I wish I'd never disappoint people want to do better, so there's is vas need for coaching that would lead to Improvement yet almost nothing to speak of it certainly not nothing large scale in any city that has this approach where look we are going to teach you how to better engage with the the material world around you in the the better engage with reality itself that's going to leave you the more spiritually physically emotionally fulfilled I got Cena W big business Atwood real one way to teach this stuff is by example that if a person exemplify body functioning they can Inspire another person

<timemark seconds="6224" />

maybe the only way went one strategy that I if I can do this if I have a patient if I can introduce that patient to someone who's had their condition is now better that is a very powerful way to up their belief in the possibility getting better yeah that makes sense which is why people love user testimonials right but but better if you actually meet them in person than she won't see for yourself but user testimonials are so huge for that reason why we know I was skeptical at first but then I tried it and he was just like me when I look at the Giant number of people that are unhappy and displaced into seem like they're left out of society I was listening to it was Johann Hari on Sam Harris is podcast they were talking about the number of people that are happy with what they do for a living happy with what

<timemark seconds="6284" />

do everyday and it was somewhere around 13% and then the number of people that we're just like it's okay I just do it like I don't hate it but I don't love it that was like in the 60% and then the rest of the people fucking hated what they did so the vast majority some ungodly number you know like 87% of people hate what they're doing oh how sad don't hate it they don't want any doing it and they do it all the time that's crazy to have a profound effect on all aspects of your life right I like what I do to help all these people absolutely and also to see a lot of the things that I've you nobly for so long becoming more mainstream that's good and much more so now than ever before

<timemark seconds="6344" />

you were doing those studies in the 1960s and you thought that marijuana is going to be legal in 5 years how would you ever first of all how could you ever thought of the internet right that's the Big White Edition Wilson of information or yeah that's that's really the big one the decentralized distribution information that's that by the way in medicine has real it's one of the things that's most level the playing field between doctors and patients you know it should have ended the authoritarian paternalistic kind of medicine than this when I grew up I think they know everything many many patients who have gotten exactly the information they needed and we're able to take it to the doctor who didn't know about it I mean I think on the whole it's a really good thing for sure know know for sure I get her doctor to be worn out by it all the time and I listen to me I went to school this is what it is it's good for them to have to let go of that well there's no way you could know everything

<timemark seconds="6404" />

Tribune especially doctors they must know that they have a specialty for a reason could a human body so insanely complicated there's no way anybody is a general Specialists of every single aspect of medicine but we need more analyst one of the problems we got too many specialists and there's still someone would you think of a general is to someone who sort of guide you towards very specialest showing that states that have a higher number of prime of a primary care physicians family doctors have better medical outcomes than patient with a high percentage of specialist awesome Specialties pay more so we should be changing that we should be providing Financial incentives for people to go into general medicine that by the time you get to a specialist usually you're really messed up right now if you're going to a back specialist you might have like a real situations would bother you for a long time we're as you go to a general practitioner for a check-up is my you know by annual check-up he just

<timemark seconds="6464" />

giving you the once-over making sure everything's okay how you sleep and how you eating drinking and smoking cigarettes what's going on just get a sense of you do they have enough time is not a big issue account so you can be spared when you when you work with patient I take an hour and an hour clinics we do 90-minutes on the first session office in 10 minutes he just his prescription get out of here you know that there's been studies on the amount of time and a medical encounter when a patient starts at talk how soon the doctor interrupts the patient 13 seconds I use the same number of people that are happy with what they do there you go that's pretty good

<timemark seconds="6515" />

13 seconds wow hurts and I've been what have you ever eaten in a True Food Kitchen what does that mean it's a restaurant True Food Kitchen where are they wanting Pasadena where I'm going to go after the show and you know I'm in Pasadena tonight for dinner if you want it it's my alarm you know it's delicious healthy food that it's the wonderful food that conforms the good nutritional principles as anti-inflammatory diet and there's something for everyone there is like meat there is vegan options vegetarian gluten-free very delicious food True Food Kitchen & Incredibly that's a great idea to be able to serve people things that you know for a fact they're going to be

<timemark seconds="6575" />

healthy nutritious not just taste good but good for you to come in there and I would love to try it definitely how do you eat for the most part you said you eat fish and you eat through that. I try I try to grow a lot of my own food I love fruit fresh up out of the garden I like to cook and I invent recipes which is in a lot of the recipes in the restaurant or mine so I I like simple you know simple quick preparations that are really good do fasted all I have been exciting experiment with intermittent fasting and I haven't found a regimen that works exactly right for me but I'm fascinated by it I do 18 or 16 and how often do you do that I try to do it 4 days a week you know it's sometimes it's difficult when I travel yeah but even then more accustomed to it then

<timemark seconds="6635" />

before so if you know I eat dinner at 8 at night it's it's not hard to wait till you get back okay so hard my body is really used to it now about a year so maybe a little bit more than that makes a lot of sense that I really have been thinking a lot about doing is doing a multiple-day fast just a water fast I've done that with the longest I've done it for three days the first or the second they was difficult the third day fabulous and I felt Manor Drive time I mind working very clear the problem that I have is how do you come off it cuz it's like very easy to slide into eating you know Pizza Krispy Kreme tags axe yeah I guess I think there's protocols in terms of like small amounts of fruit right like right when you coming out blueberries which I was transitioning

<timemark seconds="6694" />

sex with a buzzer you feel like having a bowl of March I am normally my my pattern is I want to eat as soon as I get up so that those morning hours are hard for me but if I have no have my matcha that helps exercise I do I swim mostly open walk everyday I find that once my body got used to fasted exercise much much easier it just became like before I would almost have anxiety attached to it like I can't work out without food I have to eat and then when I started doing intermittent fasting and then I start doing fasted exercise I think it was I'm sure if you probably measured me in terms of like he did a bunch of like weightlifting exercises and measured my output

<timemark seconds="6754" />

probably would be able to lift more weight if I had some fruit first haha I'm pretty sure I'd have a little bit more energy for probably measurable but it's not difficult to have a vigorous workout in the morning when you fast if you just got to get used to it yeah I often do either hot yoga or run first thing in the morning weight lifting but swimming about you every fast it's windy I have a problem with it

<timemark seconds="6786" />

now why'd you get off the pot

<timemark seconds="6789" />

you know what changed for me in the end I really used it regularly in my twenties and thirties and when I first started using it it was great of a hilarious highs laughing you know a lot more introspective and an interesting creative writing for helping writing stuff like that and then gradually transitioned into making me groggy and they're not doing much for me in for you know what they took me awhile to separate myself from a butt in the last years of it it was groggy and sedated I think I changed my body changed that's interesting have you ever tried different strains

<timemark seconds="6833" />

I have first one only to smoke because you know I'm really into freezing and I just can't put smoke into my lawn have tried to vaping I don't I just don't like the effect of it these days anything you know I don't like oral feels you know it's too strong for me yeah well when you talking about that half of a half a grain of sand putting you on Pluto light 12 hours imagine that boy I'll tell you for me the most profound and intense experience I ever have in the sensory deprivation tank are edible marijuana edible marijuana in that tank that combination is just the real strong dose because you have you done yeah but not with not with pot and I was like Adele except for trying to go yeah and sober you have some pretty out trippy experiences while you're in there but there's something about the

<timemark seconds="6893" />

but I experienced with edible marijuana is that when you close your eyes you got a lot of really cool visual but I have had before when I take pot and then get on a plane like right right when I park my car at the airport or when I'm leaving the house and it kicks in when you're on the plane or closing your eyes something about closing your eyes that you have like really brightly cover colored visuals oven time and I get that alot inside the tank if I with the with marijuana huh

<timemark seconds="6925" />

I had that with that real strong stuff I definitely am. That's what's weird about it right it's like he does become a psychedelic especially at high-dose and why are they making that stuff so strong Catalina run unnecessary how many milligrams do they say it was wasn't much mg or 1 will take one more thing like that back 500mg like why do you need that because you started out with ten way up to 500 do you do you regularly meditate or what kind of meditation I first practice is in and then I took some of the positive training and now I don't want to get up I sit down I do my breathing routine and then I just try to

<timemark seconds="6985" />

focus on Body Sensations and sounds in the room and when I'm caught up in my thoughts I just bring my attention back to my breathing but you know for me I think that the sitting sitting meditation that's fine but I think the goal is to be able to carry that stayed and all of your activities so for me cooking is meditative you're chopping vegetables working with knives and that's premeditated for me so when do you think that when you're having this meditation with Zen or whatever that you are you are resetting the way you're going to go through life for the rest of the day hopefully I mean about the day we kind of have a responsibility don't you agree like you're a guy who's teaching people how to live a more productive Health your life because I have responsibilities live your own productive healthy diabetic

<timemark seconds="7045" />

right I guess I wouldn't feel right doing that if I didn't practice it myself but myself

<timemark seconds="7054" />

Jeep when you have some thoughts about things like something like iboga would you be interested in trying it yourself for sure yeah I have an opportunity to do it it's supposed to be ruthlessly introspective never done either I had a bad friends who had a pill problems who out who did it and cured them but they said the ride is just 24 hours of like what in the fuc am I doing and then once it's over you have zero desire it's user that's Hunters take it and they remain motionless for many hours on it animals come close I mean I always faster than me

<timemark seconds="7096" />

that is it is fascinating

<timemark seconds="7099" />

yeah I wonder if I taking it from the route I wonder if they have a if it's there getting the exact same experience as they're getting in these clinics I don't know it just it to me it in terms of advocacy if you look at the receipt of them are the rates of relapse rather

<timemark seconds="7124" />

nobody wants to talk about these are all these clinics like it's crazy how many rehab clinics or are they all we need you for six months really Mexico says they kill it all in three days I go down there and into a clinic I want to find out more about it on my list to listen man thanks for being here thanks thanks for all the wrong information that you shared over the years I want you to do studies and burning yourself and getting punched I will I will tell people how they can find out about you what is your website social medias.
