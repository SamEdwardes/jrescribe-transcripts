this gentleman who I'm about to bring to the podcast without him there probably would not be this thing or I would have started way later but who knows it mean that might not have even started it it's interesting out one thing will trigger a thought in your mind and ego huh and then that will Trigger action and then next thing you know many years later your world has changed and a lot of what this podcast is was inspired by my guest today Anthony cumia Anthony was part of Opie and Anthony which is a gigantic radio show at one point in time I used to do the show a regular basis I always did it whenever I was in New York and Anthony started doing this show from his basement he put up a green screen and set up the whole stage and he was calling at live from the compound and

<timemark seconds="477" />

that inspired me I thought about it and I watch them do that I'm at why don't I do something like that and now you're listening to that that is how it started so please welcome my friend Anthony cumia The Joe Rogan Experience

<timemark seconds="499" />

Anthony cumia where alive sir I love it Joe Rogan if it was not for you oh my God this would not exist that percent actual fact I was watching you doing live from the compound me and Brian Redban were sitting in my fucking living room and we're watching you would you were fucking playing karaoke you're singing karaoke with a machine gun in front of a green screen and I was like this guy just got to set up his own Studio like he already has Opie and Anthony show at the time you guys were at Sirius XM and you just decided to do this thing in your basement for a goof yeah it was like a hobby it's like guys who don't have kids married or not married don't have kids don't have anybody tell him what to do when they also have disposable income then you get to see what guys really want to do they want to sing karaoke with a machine gun in front of a green screen yeah it was crazy crazy gun guy karaoke so I could do that if if I was married I would have a wife that would lose her mind at my

<timemark seconds="559" />

make my living room table that you're supposed to have a candle on and we'll tchotchkes and stuff is a widescreen computer monitor and a gaming system right next to the table I have a gaming computer that's just unbelievable and I sit there and just play video games so the table itself is a gaming monitor yeah the whole table while the touch screen ones giant wide monitor so I got like 40 inch wide table know it's on the table goggles up on the console by the TV it's just a sensors around the room for the VR it's a a a playground and you're absolutely right guys will spend their money on having fun if it's allowed to display says this place is insane that's all you're allowed

<timemark seconds="619" />

and they have the the man cave the chicks are allowed down here I got the TV and I'm like no her place is the whole house cuz she relegated you one room I got in your happy about your happy that you got one room happy wife happy life that's apparently it didn't work you know this the real quote that I say way too many times in this podcast but I love the quote most men live lives of Silent desperation wow yeah that is true it's a hundred percent true it was I was married for time and it was it was a nightmare it was a living hell for me the only thing that got me through as many years as I was married cuz I was married 9 years and I don't remember one happy year out of those 9th but I got into radio pretty early on in that marriage and that was my life so I dedicated myself no matter how

<timemark seconds="679" />

Isabel anything else in my life was I was doing radio so I thought it was awesome I have a theory about that I really do I think that a person needs a certain amount of suffering in their life and if you look at some of the all-time great Comics or even all-time great radio personalities like Howard Stern Howard Stern during his Heyday when he was the fucking man was miserable right right he would talk about it he would hide in his basement I love those Dorothea the hide and it is just talk about masturbating and hiding from his wife and he can't get any sex and you like it didn't matter if he was huge didn't matter if he was famous didn't matter how Richie was it matter was hiding in the basement and that asked came out on the radio if you're related to him you understood it yeah yeah I I I get that and it worked for me cuz there was a lot of MS

<timemark seconds="739" />

like when I started doing really well we moved back to New York from from Boston after we got fired opening myself and because we always thought that the radio April Fool's jokes was so stupid and Hoagie and what we change the format to all Elvis and it's like after 10 minutes date to April 4th so we're like let's just go balls-out say the mayor's dead and have a news guy come on and report it and everything and then it was supposed to say subsequently get more outrageous as the the the show went on so by the end of it there was a Taiwan male hooker in the car with them and they crash does he was getting a blowjob is it like it was going to get really ridiculous but they stopped it early on and never allowed us to even mention it so people really thought he died although it's kind of stupid you go to a show for your news

<timemark seconds="799" />

but back then the internet wasn't what it is now I think it was barely a thing cuz that was 90 97 around there 98 what what year did you get on your probably early and I was on really early like the eighties I was on bulletin board service and used to play trivia games with a 300 baud Modem with people and I thought it was amazing even then and then in in the when we were up in Boston I bought a digital camera that was just this giant thing and I had a laptop another giant big and I would take pictures of what was going on in the studio and then post them that night on a website that I figured out I used to code the HTML myself and make a website just to post pictures and links and people thought it was amazing like you're seeing what we talked about that day it was an instant but it was pretty cool and I

<timemark seconds="859" />

doing videos I was able to put video like maybe 8 second clips of nude girls if they were in the studio and pop that up and people loved it and then I got a bill from the the company for bandwidth and I didn't know bandwidth it was a $12,000 bill for a month did thousands of people uncompressed and apparently they had that happen a couple of times so they told me just don't do it again they didn't make me pay which was pretty cool but at that point I had to learn about you know coding and a compression and things like that so you just kept doing it and just just put them in some sort of a compressed warm as hell yeah I would you would you use to remember back then God I think it was like for audio it was real audio which is hilarious

<timemark seconds="918" />

video God I can't even remember what it was but it was terrible it was all pixelated you know like 10 frames per minute things like real audio which was everywhere just yet they just quit around still and a changed into something else you know I got bought out that somebody up yeah yeah that happens to everything but honestly if it was not for you and your show live from the compound and fruit propionate larious because open Anthony was the first radio show that I read what are WearEver realize you don't really have to have a format yeah you just talk yeah it was just kind of a talk thing was a hang it was a hang and a lot of the week we were on the same, but it was the same company as Howard Stern Sirius Radio look at that Real Steel hear it does it make stories from your videos and photos now but this is exactly what it is real. The real player automatically makes video stories from your best photos

<timemark seconds="979" />

I know it's hill now. Like I kind of Montage he's weird codex the code of weird kodak's it all like who fucking who compiled on RealPlayer from BitTorrent on your computer to play it with Kodak not available yeah exactly pissed off cuz he'll I go to find a lack I remember the first time I ever got a porn video sent to me I was like this is crazy yeah yeah porn video for was just photos you know I guess it was around the mid-90s my brother picked up a an Apple computer I don't even know what model it was or anything but it was it was pretty good for the time and

<timemark seconds="1039" />

I just sat in front of that thing for hours and hours on end just one porn pic it was no videos just pictures and you know how they used to scroll sometimes it was a corrupt file so halfway down or just turn white and pixelated and Zig zaggy but just for hours just one more one more slowly emerged is very very compelling yeah yeah that it was downloading photos on a 14k modem technology end of it cuz you got thumb drives with more memory than entire computers had a few years ago and then I remember I guess it was Bill Gates or something said you'll you'll never need anything more powerful than a 486 years ago it's like that but a couple of Megs of memory and

<timemark seconds="1099" />

just crazy that you need demand for for a computer power got way out of hand with games and stuff you download a game like Red Dead Redemption 2 or Call of Duty

<timemark seconds="1115" />

i n n it's 75 200 gigs feeling those games yeah and it's like that would have been a hundred computers and to think of those floppy disks used to get games on a pallet stacked up like 6 feet high of those discs to load it on a computer so make those sounds and hopefully it would work and yeah now you just download them I haven't been to a a gaming store in years cuz with the origin or steam you just download the game right off of your offline and like I don't know who goes to GameStop or anything anymore if people still do the Xbox and Playstation Xbox you can download

<timemark seconds="1175" />

having a conversation with Jordan Peterson about this yesterday off there I was saying I'm really I get concerned because I feel like all of our information like the vast majority of it is now digital we have some things that are written down on paper but even paper so it's so easy to break and burn and fuck up at me we lost most of human beings lost most of the information about Egypt when they burn the Library of Alexandria Munoz mean there could have been all sorts of schematics and some diagrams detailed diagram how they built some of the things they built starting from scratch again yeah the when when it takes some form of electricity to to get to all this information you're really dependent on that there's going to be power that type of power of forever and even if we figure out how to reboot electricity and save some day in the future what if we have a massive coronal mass ejection and it fucking new

<timemark seconds="1235" />

the entire the whole grid and all the satellites go down and we have to start from scratch the decade two decades before people start rebuilding computers again that actually work was going to have to decipher all this information they're going to have to figure out those kodak's they're going to have to figure out how to get drivers to make all the stuff work and if they could have missed a lot of it all the info is literally ones and zeros band has to be decoded and and put back together again and some important stuff if it's on a drive somewhere I could just get nuked it's gone gone

<timemark seconds="1273" />

don't you wish that would happen it some

<timemark seconds="1277" />

how did I'm so cynical man you are you really up lately more so I think over the course of the past few years I've just got more cynical and I think social media had a big effect on me tell you engaged too much yes I'm off social media now I have been for maybe months at least you know your personal choice Twitter kicked me off quite a few times but they kick you out for his dumb shit to it wasn't even though it wasn't even that bad like the last one it was I was defending Jimmy Norton some girl was on just bashing Jimmy and and I was like look at you I go I don't even know what you are first of all you're either a masculine girl or a feminine guy and your hair looks like it was dyed with. Blood is she has a and

<timemark seconds="1337" />

play suspended me why was the backwards. Blige I order a blitch whatever it was ever whichever case which I still don't know actually but so I get kicked off a lot I have a Twitter account now but I have not told anybody what the name is or cuz I just use it for research for the Show Twitter gets the news before the news like that's where everything breaks now on Twitter you know what's interesting to me Louis Farrakhan still on Twitter it's it's amazing. Evil Jews crazy anti-semetic and for whatever reason they're scared to kick him off yeah they won't kick him off I guess Laura Loomer is a Jewish kind of independent reporter girl and nut case. Case

<timemark seconds="1397" />

yeah yeah whatever you want to sell it as it was going on and she was yelling at Twitter a bullhorn she was using the Republicans whatever you want to call her pretty mellow when it comes to it they don't demonstrate really they like to just get in there and and do their shit whatever it is but liberals really like getting out there and marching and yelling and bull horns and stuff like that so it was weird like to see that on the other end but she she just screaming and I guess I guess they unhooked her and arrested our stuff before they kicked her off for talking about Islam and talk about how Twitter was celebrate

<timemark seconds="1457" />

women's day whatever whatever that was on a certain day by focusing like the picture was one of those Islamic women that got elected to office up in the Woods Minnesota or somewhere so she said how hypocritical that was because for female genital mutilation and against women's rights and they kill gay people in and that's all she posted and she got kicked off for the hate speech against Islam and and and her argument was Louis Farrakhan the saying you know I'm not an anti-semite I'm a termite equating Jews with insects which is pretty 1930s Germany kind of a thing so in a while her heart was in the right place I guess I could come off a little wacky she also had a star of David a yellow star of David on her or shirt as she was changed to Twitter and people upset with that there she is

<timemark seconds="1517" />

I just thought to tell you the truth I thought it was a good strategic move because you going to buy time with that cuz the police do not want that optic of a uniform guy kind of pulling a girl off they're wearing a star David they can just picture looks bad or sometime but I don't know if that was her motive she planned it out well she did apparently it was the number one trending topic on Twitter but which is odd that you know she gets kicked off and ends up being the the number one trending topic what's really odd is this is wild manafort give me a purge himself right now is going after Trump's deeper ties Cohen is now saying that Trump was in cahoots with Putin who's going to give him the $50 Penny Tower in Moscow yeah yeah you know all that but that girl got kicked out shooter it sounds ridiculous because I got like I said I got kicked off and

<timemark seconds="1577" />

bummed about it but it's because it's on it's not just a private company anymore that can do what they want I'm not free government regulation so I don't know how you fix this but Twitter is now a thing where the presidents on it world leaders are discussing things on it Emergency Management FEMA and and the Weather Service says they put out alerts in case of danger or some kind of event that's going to happen and because of your political ideology or calling a girl. Blood hair you're not privy to alerts and safety information that it's clear that it's not everyone's doesn't have to follow the same rules we've already established I was Farrakhan Trump Sam Harris has been on he was at least I think he's abandon it but it was on a quest to get Jack to try to hold up his terms of service agreement and and kick Trump off of Twitter

<timemark seconds="1637" />

nuclear war do you understand the craziest using Twitter ever and I think Jack's position was that it is it's more beneficial to have him on and it's really we are getting to see his personality in a way we've never seen any president problem absolutely the most ridiculous petty shit that he does like attacking Michelle wolf because of her White House Correspondents people losers making fun of the girl on Joe Scarborough the girl he married Mitre

<timemark seconds="1676" />

I mean do you think she really really think she showed up at Mar-A-Lago bleeding the fucking plastic surgeries going to fucking Maniac but meanwhile that it's good for us to say because it educates us to who he is as a real person right I keep this a lot of who you are just gets exposed in those tweets Twitter but you can get you can parse out little chunks will you get it a good taste and for him it's very very revealing yeah it is a weird thing this is what I think this will be looked back on as a very pivotal moment in American history and in politics wear that kind of Crossroad happened because we were we were pretty satisfied with that political speech thing that end we need to bring up the lower-middle-class to the and they just go on and on and drone on it's this weird

<timemark seconds="1736" />

set no real human being ever speaks like Hillary was hilarious and it's absolutely batshit insane like the stuff he says like you were saying the other day he's giving a speech and he said that when he was younger people said he looked like Elvis cuz he was doing some kind of a commemorative thing for Elvis down in Tennessee or somewhere and he says that he looked like I was laughing her ass off me and Keith it because no one ever told me was blacked out this no one ever told them that and there's so many things and I vote Trump. I voted for the guy cuz I wanted that monkey wrench thrown into the machine I felt we have gotten screwed too many decades and it was time to let Washington know the like look we rather elect this nut than any of you

<timemark seconds="1796" />

so I think it proves a point there are enough checks and balances in place where the likes of anyone president really isn't going to do that much damage I think he's pulled the cover up a lot of stuff I think people are trying to compete with him on Twitter politicians are trying to play his game and kind of fun to watch as a comic Entertainer it's gold to see Tulsi gabbard said to him she's a congresswoman from Hawaii she said being Saudi Arabia's Bitch isn't making America First like all kind of taking that they used to do that and it's odd that year old guy was the one that was like bringing Twitter to social media into this forum it is on and yeah you would think it would be some young guy to get in there and do it but

<timemark seconds="1856" />

Jeff the guy you'll never see a chain of events like what happened to elect Donald Trump the rich guy is dumb a billionaire a million whatever you want to call and got a lot of money from his dad from his dad and then you know I remember him in New York when I was a kid Trump was always in the news developer was always banging heads are politicians trying to get some kind of zoning thing going or build some other Tower somewhere and so we were all familiar with him and we know he was like this piece of shit guy like everyone was surprised by the pussy like we saw in the daily news in New York Post every week Trump was with some other who was it to us but he got out there and it was the perfect timing like we come off the the heels of 8 years of a Democratic president

<timemark seconds="1913" />

and it just was people ready for a maniac to be in the White House some people are exact my favorite image of the election was that lady with the sock hat on her knees with the glasses screaming screaming

<timemark seconds="1931" />

it like that to me I should in this era of outrage and Chaos yeah yeah it just did it that was the Primal scream that set off The Dominoes and they're all in motion right now it wasn't supposed to happen it wasn't supposed to happen Hillary was supposed to be president that's what everybody thought it was going to go down in history as just one of those wacky elections and then business as usual but you know when Trump won it turned everything upside down and rip the cover off of I think not only politics in Washington but a Hollywood the mainstream media the news media everything had the covers ripped off and everyone's now got a peek inside and realize how fucked up everything is you know you used to assume Washington at least the people had some kind of control like they were they were adults doing the job that needed and then you realize all my got everyone's just a piece of shit

<timemark seconds="1991" />

do you want to hear the story that disappeared from years ago remember the Washington Madam that suicide or Self book filled with politicians that were there were banging all these prostitutes and she was going to release everything and she was doing press conferences and then she quit it to us I made it suicide things like that happen like politicians kill people there is there secret backroom deals that happen and it's crazy House of Cards is way closer to reality that people would like to believe yeah yeah they closer we over the course of the decades and decades every year that goes by we seem to get a little more knowledge and a little less confident in the government can I watch some shit from the 50s you know there's plenty of things on YouTube and even even industrial films just this thing of how a fan

<timemark seconds="2051" />

how to raise your family how to be a good wife all that stuff and it was all this weird propaganda of what America was and then as years go by you realize how it was all bullshit like politicians were always getting rich and no one seems to know how or why and these deals that are made aren't always in our best interest they're not civil servants there to represent and help you and and as the years go by we see more and more this and the past two years with Trump is just been a man quite a crash course it really yeah it's great I'm fascinated to see where it goes I'm fasting to see if he seems you know I mean they always called Gotti the Teflon Don but it seems like Trump is the Teflon Donald I mean it it seems like all these things keep happening and it even because of that like I remember Justin Martindale comedian friend of mine is Solera

<timemark seconds="2111" />

he goes he was talking about Stormy Daniels he was like she's our Monica Lewinsky she's going to take him down he doesn't care that they know he fucked her yeah yeah isn't care to understand it's not you have to care for it to work right and that's just it people don't really care it's well some people don't care I I follow like Rosie O'Donnell's account on Twitter and Rob Reiner is another one and for two years over two years they have just been like counting down at end of the day that's like all impeachments right around the corner so he's out all they're going to put him in prison I hope you and your son get a cell next to each other how long are you going to do this 8 years is it going to be eight years of you go well any day now

<timemark seconds="2171" />

the mental patients like legitimately like a mental patient screaming at it was like he was doing like it was almost like burlesque or something I'm saying but you know how it was like the radio version of burlesque we see a girl doing burlesque it's like an a throwback to an old-timey way of doing things like the right handlebar mustache with a bowler cap introducer she is body she is Bodacious please welcome Madam and she comes to music that nobody listens to anymore and she's dancing around it's very we ended up there always kind of big girls and not skinny like little stripper lawyer the girls who eat so it's like to throw back to a different time of of route and when he was in front of that screen like like everything was like really well written and notarized precise point and I don't understand like what the

<timemark seconds="2231" />

adblue in the background was either it's just it was so it it seemed like something that someone had set up like not as good as your compound a year and your basement about it wasn't it wasn't as good as that it's like that's the background this is for GQ GQ was like okay we have $30 so I got a camera you could bring it in $30 good of a table the Ikea table of $12 of $18 left I got some big ass blue and blue and red paint the Ya-Ya sisters out there and his last thing was like cuz the end is eminent there's no no reason for me to go on my work here is done play some of this Trump is finished

<timemark seconds="2293" />

wow 2017 was when he quit from Trump or that molar as I've also reported here has succeeded in finding a way around Trump pardon power in either of these near-certain do you spell Trump's Doom of the seven ways for Trump to go now it will be ugly at it will tear this country nearly apart but it will be necessary the second way is as I've also repeatedly suggested here but Molly doesn't really need to prove anything about Trump and Russian sabotage lb electric your seems to be so much of Justice from the firing of James Comey to the lies about Trump Juniors meetings with the Russian that it's hard to pick out a key player in the Trump Inner Circle who could not be guilty of it

<timemark seconds="2353" />

and it's fake news yeah and it now fake news it's a hoax but it is interesting like more to be as fascinating because he seems like a ruthless motherfucker takes his time he's like a guy says hey look at me I'm going to kill you it's not going to be today okay that's all you need to know so I can kill you and like every day's plotting on killing you see him drive by your house and wait you like when it's hot when is the hammerfall and you look out your window your office he's out I mean this guy he's yeah I mean he's a cold-blooded intelligence agent yeah and how you fuck it up and he's doing everything that leads me to believe that he's not fucking it up this is a slow play and if there is if there is anything to

<timemark seconds="2413" />

the Russian thing you would think something would have leaked out by now well it has that they just played on CNN of Donald talking about how many times has actually been the rush Donald jr. you know he said that he hadn't been but then there's another video of him from years ago saying yeah been there many times do the people that are going after Trump at that they don't seem to understand the guy right up until he became president of the United States was just a private citizen business man so he had a lot of dealings around the world with his real estate and buildings and and the golf course is all this shit happened when he was just a citizen doing business now whether it was ethical or not that that could definitely be brought into question whether it's legal or not I'm sure that's what they're looking into also but he

<timemark seconds="2473" />

wasn't he wasn't beholden to the people as a public servant there wasn't a conflict of interest because he was a lifelong politician and using the power of his office to make a deal so and that also goes hand-in-hand with him just fucking around like it like if he went from a selectman in his hometown and then years and years go by and then you're the president and you built that career up any any point in there they could call you out on being a horrible human being cuz you fuck girls are good they're so you're not a shady business dealing he was just Donald fucking job so it's hard to call him out on even dealing with rush it because plenty of it is just going to deal with Russia and China I think the question is whether or not he colluded with Russia to get information about Hillary and also to put out all that propaganda against Hillary and also saying that they're going to make a deal to do the Trump Tower in Moscow

<timemark seconds="2533" />

is all while he was running for president I have not being honest about it I think that's that's where it gets again I don't know almost there is anything illegal there I don't know if there's anything that that he did that is illegal cuz I believe when you're campaigning so whatever the fuck you want to anybody I don't even think you're really running I mean you're not really lost the presidency he would still have to have some ducks in a row to continue his business so you know and his son took over that part of of what he was doing so he could campaign so weather Downey jr. went over to rush or not I don't really see you might think it's unethical and you might go well did he say if we win we'll do this and help you out so who knows about that part of it but I don't see in and of itself him going over there being that big of a problem and the fact that you know the Clinton campaign and the DNC they had a lot of shady deals going on with Russia also in that

<timemark seconds="2593" />

crazy. CA and an English spy and a Russian like and that just never seems to get any traction it's weird well there's way more left-wing media Publications in the right when I was just a fact there's only a few right-wing newspapers and right-wing websites are often times Moline that yeah newspaper that's tree of the same amount of respect is the New York Times the New York Post I don't know who you are liberal Democrat row Conservative Republican the fuck you some of the headlines that have come off the fucking post have been classic over the years they're amazing Comics yeah yeah it's just comedy one was kind of what I thought was just so do she went Fred Astaire died it was said a Stairway to Heaven

<timemark seconds="2653" />

but that's normal say I'm hit written about New York and Boston to us to the comedy cuz people are fucking cold it's cold in the winter time is calling like fucking that growing up there man it fucking is flavored meat flavored Burr a million guys like that that like that Patrice. Fuc u, d a lot of it came out of that part of the world cuz that part of the world's different isn't that weird it's it's cold cold and a lot of people I think and very few people makes people like more down homie and compassionate they stay together Hannah except for a few serial killers randomly the right into the woods you get like people that work together and help each other cuz I realize are in this together yeah there is a there's a stark difference between New York and Boston base comics

<timemark seconds="2713" />

and La Base, it's amazing different yeah yeah and some of them have that crossover appeal there and they've moved in and like Bill you know may means that Boston sensibility the New York sensibility yeah about him is that he still a Savage right exact yeah yeah yeah I like that you don't grow that out here it's sunny it's nice every day every once everyone seems kind of pleasant out here it whether it's real or phoniness but it comes off as pleasant tree and a New York it's just a grave disregard for everybody you literally step over people have a million pennies and you drop a penny or whatever should rank lost a guy in the train whatever it is just laying in the gutter of the street

<timemark seconds="2773" />

in some small town in Kansas that the police and ambulance would be called and people would stop and ask if he was okay and end in New York you literally step over those people just don't even look in their face it's a it's an inconvenience that someone is laying on the sidewalk if you were in the middle of a snowstorm and you were your car broke down and you saw a guy laying on the side of the road you help them of course Jesus poor guy we were going to help him to hey buddy alright not so New York to see him lying in his own piss needle hanging out of his dick yeah and I don't and I'm pissed that it stinks Subway think too though in a steamy August day it's the worst that it's gotten worse under a De Blasio's and mayor of New York now and about Giuliani who

<timemark seconds="2833" />

now is batshit crazy what happened with him I don't know I think there's some blew a fuse he's respectable any more like some kind of immediately gets you put into a category but he's also will I think it's got some dementia like he just doesn't seem right that like what you saying with the comb over and he realized that he had during 9/11 going on he was 9 10 2001 he was a piece of shit no one like Giuliani Room New York you ruined it by commercializing it cleaning up all the porn theaters getting rid of the tunnel bunnies in the squeegee guys like he went on a tear just gave the people

<timemark seconds="2893" />

Department carte blanche to start racking head and taking care of business it cleaned up New York Times Square turned into a Disney type atmosphere instead of that drug-addled fucking mess that it was and and people hated him what kind of ruining that gritty New York that we saw on taxi driver and shit and then 911 he was America's mayor that's what they called him America's best he's going out of Yankee games into Ovations and people he's standing with the awesomest bro is a lot of power and shaving your head on the side of his head unless you do a lot of drugs so I kind of miss Thompson it's hard to pull that off I think that's a that's a comb over in the beginning of that to the right to the right with a suit

<timemark seconds="2953" />

first started that's the full-time oh my God it's working in the back did he try to get plugs or something in the front pic so I know what that is just was rocking up. Wrong come over at is he he had a lot to do with the the the the mafia 5 families all that shit was still running pretty rampant throughout the 70s and 80s as a kid me and my brother used to laugh our asses off we open the newspaper and it was like Johnny the horse was found dead so we would laugh our asses off at the names like just those those mob names it's it's hilarious and that scene in Goodfellas of the beginning when they're just going through and get out of the nose and kill her and this guy nail hat have those fucking names that are hilarious and he was a big part of that I'm surprised

<timemark seconds="3013" />

kill him like he was absolutely responsible he kept going after them and kept putting them away with the you know the new Rico statutes that they had and locked up a lot of mobsters man so we do another problem with the monsters they started rapping on each other as soon as you start all your mistake is gone is gone the whole things that you guys have omerta you keep your fucking mouth shut you do your time like a man right to get out your hero and at this whole thing keeps going this thing of ours is still but those fucking pussy didn't want to go to jail isn't that something like the old school guys would be offered you know you can walk or you could get a really easy sentence just talk a fuck your mother and then yeah yeah they reach the point where it's like yeah I'm not built for prison prison though it was like in Goodfellas

<timemark seconds="3073" />

the internet ruined all that too yeah yeah he was probably all dead before the internet but I know he was free but he did his time did the minimum amount of time he killed at least 10 people they mean he wanted they want to die so bad I was a fucking straight up psychopath yeah that's total serial killer yeah and they let him walk and then he got arrested eventually for selling ecstasy in Phoenix he moved to Phoenix after that yeah yeah and then he was running down there and how did he act out like was low I was gone they all were gone is it all did it all crumbled if that's something yeah just like yeah yeah went away he was the first one that was like real flashy in public

<timemark seconds="3133" />

yeah yeah they didn't like that Vincent the chin always used to walk around like a crazy person the bathrobe at Rose would give people directions while he was doing that but I felt like everything was being bugged so they would do if they Bug cars along his walking route right behind that is hilarious yeah the Mystique was gone though yeah it wasn't really like the Russian still have the Mystique Russian Mobsters they are brutal to scary ones like they are the scary ones there's there's a worse mop because regardless of what it turned into there was a time where the Italian mob did have a line like you didn't cross family things like that the Russians all my God will they fuck up an entire family dog everything gets killed and in the worst way yeah they're scary scary motherfucker I had an expiry

<timemark seconds="3193" />

some out it was Broadway I guess and they have those pedal cabs that go around there all Russian dude big and legs on a pedal around and I was looking for a cab a real cab to take me downtown I'm going to ride 15 blocks in a tricycle With Yuri pedaling in front of it so this guy passed by once and said you need cab I was like nah I'm good thanks comes around again I'm still waiting for a cab and go cab I was like I'm not going to have to Pedal me 15 fucking blocks no move and and you can yell at a cab driver in New York don't yell out your window and stuff they rarely will get out of their car they know you know you got some Italian right there you could call the number and say you were being harassed by a cab driver so they won't do anything this guy gets off his fucking bike you have a fucking problem your fucking problem and I was just like oh shit it's going down

<timemark seconds="3253" />

this guy means busy and of course I know all good thank you I don't need a cab you're right the mother fuc and they're not regular white people know they're not they're hard people we saw that on top of Connor punch him in the face saying let's talk now

<timemark seconds="3286" />

just Twisted of Russians just up in in a steel i-beams like a hundred stories up backflip swing into a backflip hanging by two fingers is sometimes and sometimes it is so uncomfortable to watch and because they're at they get themselves in this position where maybe there's a thin little alcove and and they put their hands against one side their feet against the other this if your feet slip there's no no recovering me crazy today I have some friends that just know that I freaked out so they send me those everyday Christ there is some things that

<timemark seconds="3344" />

are online. Just call my God

<timemark seconds="3353" />

they are nuts I can't do this man my hands are pouring sweat oh my God look at this crazy ass hole feel me oh my God. Crazyshit what does it say Daredevil returns with latest shocking stunt on skyscraper this fucking mother fucker but he's doing a handstand on what is that a three in each Corner what are you doing one little one little fucking miscalculation or how do you do that how do you know your center of gravity is just going to pull you write the fuck off Jesus Christ went around the corner

<timemark seconds="3410" />

what is this guy's life like if he just decides he's going to do this this makes me very uncomfortable that is so it's so high I can't do what he did it was on the ground right yeah so I can't I can't do those handstands and all that jazz on the ground and try to stay on it with your hair right right and then give it so I could jump up and grab it and hang see how much that I could do you know I will definitely fuk with you light like if you're riding a bike on a sidewalk you'll never fall off the sidewalk you can just ride your bike you don't even have to think about it sidewalk white couple of feet wide if that was over like the Grand Canyon you what you would be shame you couldn't do it and it's the same fucking thing it's just your perception

<timemark seconds="3470" />

the height and you'd be fucked up you be like this I'm going to fall off we have that HTC Vive in the back room here you go to the hardware store and you buy a two-by-four and you lay it down on the floor and then the game is you put the VR goggles on and you're walking on this two-by-four over like in between two skyscrapers right size you're doing it in like you hear sound like

<timemark seconds="3502" />

oh yes it to I-4 so this two-by-four is real but give an actual two-by-fours I'm really walking on this so you're feeling it and you walk the plank oh my God

<timemark seconds="3514" />

oh my God you look down what is that thing floating in front of you what's that supposed to be Jamie

<timemark seconds="3524" />

yeah the first of all watching on a screen does VR no justice you can't really you are in a space it's so cool to kind of look around that they definitely have more work to do it's it looks cool you feel like you're in a 3D environment but it's not very photo-realistic know your kids are addicted to it I really put the VR got in a fight over it I need to put the VR goggles on please fucking crazy games yeah I have the Oculus and Vive and the PlayStation VR at home and rest right now the Oculus is the the highest quality of the VR goggles I think PlayStation I seem pretty cool games out there though and five does too but I think Oculus is going to come out very soon with a completely wireless one

<timemark seconds="3584" />

tripping over wires and shit that's going to be but yeah that that's pretty huge it's weird though because some games aren't conducive to VR and you would think like I play Call of Duty or Battlefield 5 World War thing just came out and I love that that game but I couldn't play that for our because I will play for fucking hours on end and tablet goggles on that long and trying to play a shooter like that I think we are right now is more conducive to experiences then it is like that that's pretty much not a game it's an experience and it brings you into a whole nother 3D world around you but like a shooter game like Battlefield or Call of Duty not really conducive to be all right now not yet yeah I think in the future though plastic gun that's like a real if you were holding a real plastic I needed that interface a few other ideas that they're working on that should be avail

<timemark seconds="3644" />

pretty relatively soon where the system at your house like the room you're in off of your headset and will superimpose things over the couch like it'll be a ammo crate a chair turns into a box ammo crate so as you walk around the room it's reading your room but making this VR world that looks more military or like a jungle or whatever it is so it won't be a couch you'll hit it but in Your Vision it'll be a box or an ammo crate or you know what a car something like that so that's kind of cold utilizing the Real Environment around you and then superimposing shit over it you know what else is really cool the boxing games boxing games you get a crazy workout you get a real legit work out cuz you're actually like fake boxing just cartoon character yeah yeah and when you get hit you see a bright white flash like like you tagged you like you got hit

<timemark seconds="3704" />

you got your bell rung yeah yeah you but you get you get a real workout when you're doing that so yeah my girl plays at and it's hilarious it's funny to watch people do the art expensive stuff like that cuz they're ducking there's another shooter game that she was playing and it's hilarious cuz she's like screaming and ducking down and your hand is up like pulling a trailer on a fake gun over something that isn't even there it's cool to watch people play some crazy zombie game to my kids play a bunch of guns and ammo and then the zombies are closing in on you got a gun them down yeah yeah this is weird I tell you there is some games or or experience as we were walking through the kind of a haunted house thing that are genuinely fucking alarming like like you don't want to you don't want to go around the corner you don't want to do anything and you know like there's when you watch on a monitor it's just the monitor their shit behind you that you're not seeing unless you.

<timemark seconds="3764" />

around look so you hear a sound and be like I am not to I don't want to turn around I know that things can be right in my face what is the alien game for Oculus is a a Ridley Scott alien yeah that's that I think it's both good is that I had it for Oculus it to go to provide yeah yeah alien something yeah it's the one like a lien the original movie it starts with the doors open up in that little thing drinking of the water that little chachki on the on the task and it's really gives a good the recreation of the of the movie what you can't fucking awesome. One of my favorite examples of diversity of movies this movie

<timemark seconds="3816" />

had a female lead who's the female Superstar who spoiler alert once of winning in the end but you don't even notice now it never feels like it's crammed down your throat right the last Star Wars get the fuck out of here Laura Dern you're not running the Empire like she's the head General and then Carrie Fisher's the other head General and it's on these men to shut up and it's all make sense to you isn't that fucking amazing posterous that they had that was 1979 and they had more of an idea of how to present that then yeah first of all Sigourney Weaver's just a fucking bad-ass believable like that thing that you did at Disney though it go to free roaming VR experience

<timemark seconds="3876" />

the future look up Warehouse like this space out here but converted into just so yeah VR experience yeah yeah yeah we need to go damn when I first saw alien back you know kids I saw in the movie theater when it first came out their kids yeah it's hard to believe it was just one of those movies at at the time everyone goes oh my God you got to see this to the chest fucking burst seen just slayed people but yeah when you watching that cuz traditional movies the guys that your own that's what happened when Tom Skerritt gets it you're just like they just killed this is like not his fucking moving a big movie star yeah yeah and then I think it was the first movie where are the spaceship was kind of a truck and it was just

<timemark seconds="3936" />

yep just regular guys concerned about getting paid and and shit like that so yeah that's why it was amazing how so this is the after the Covenant movie which is a fucking awesome one that's yeah I like that one one I love you so good I like that shit at movie they nailed it was just great it didn't matter if a woman is running and it was right they went shoving it down your throat with Laura Dern and Carrie Fisher was like flying flying I wasn't feeling it feel like they were certain women like what is your name from House of Cards does the head woman

<timemark seconds="3996" />

oh yeah pain so it's something something something pain fucks her name actually use that is so good to Robin Robin Wright Wright okay Robin Wright was playing a general I believe it yeah yeah bitch some fucking tanks I believe that you would like Nuka plant I'd buy that right yeah but Carrie Fisher and then they're putting out too many Star Wars movies to have it that mistake and that kind of atmosphere that would like to go to one of them years ago it's also it's it's Disney now cuz it's consistent and it's good right but it's never stunning it's never terrifying it's never it's never ex machina

<timemark seconds="4056" />

holy shit yeah yeah do that anymore polish off the sharp edges and Sue The Experience down to write palatable mainstream appeal the first Star Wars back in a 77 again I saw that in the movie theater with my uncle my Uncle Joe took me and I didn't know Star Wars were home while I remember the trailer playing on TV and I was like alright that seems kind of cold and then we sit down and that opening scene with the giant ship just doesn't fly over and I was just from that point on I was just mesmerized noticed that you the illusion of size that they got in a ship and models like they went and bought like a bunch of different remember those old bottles and we used to do it cars anymore

<timemark seconds="4116" />

it took a bunch of parts are those things in built the Millennium Falcon they built those battleships from Mike Parts like kind of tell cuz they're so weird and the parts don't seem to match it totally worked that was you know if you couldn't imagine being an old one of those X-Wing Fighters as a kid it was just an amazing thing that's kind of gone that shows you how great alien-like Ridley Scott alien really was because although Star Wars was a great movie honestly Star Wars doesn't really hold up I'll give you watch it today you look at the special effects like what what am I watching this movie like the the monsters taste like it's weird if they're wearing a mask it's really obvious but then you go just two years later to Ridley Scott alien that mother fucker holds

<timemark seconds="4176" />

up today it looks amazing cuz I watched it with my kids my ten-year-old can handle my eight-year-old can not much you think you can handle it and then like yeah I can handle it or I would say was the first time the dude got the tongue to the forehead watch and daddy

<timemark seconds="4203" />

nightmare still remember that my dad my mom and my dad took me my brother and my sister when I was 7 years old to go see Bonnie and Clyde with Warren Beatty and what's her name there thank you and now it's it's famous for being one of the most graphic machine gunning's at the end of the movie I mean they were pulling out they got ambushed by law and they just get shot up the whole movie though as a seven-year-old kid I liked these people they were funny they rob banks and stuff but you know they did make jokes and they were cool and you got to know me as a person so is a seven-year-old I was like all these these people are cool

<timemark seconds="4257" />

so then the end of the movie comes and and they're out there and you're the birds are flying away and Clyde looks like Bonnie with a one lens missing from his his glasses and it's really quiet and then all hell breaks loose it's just five guys shooting Thompson's at both of them and they're being riddled with with bullet holes and The Scene goes on and they're falling down and against the car the car is just full yeah it is

<timemark seconds="4286" />

it's it's so brutal too crazy to see in the girl get it oh yeah something ruthless about seeing a girl gets shot a hundred times yeah yeah it was did we saw this at the drive-in and I I started vomiting in the car 7 years old we we we have been to Arby's this before I sell my Arby's was all over the car I was screaming and crying and throwing up going like what the fuck did you take me to see I like to these people I have like A2 our relationship with them and it ends like that I was horrified horrified as a kid the other certain things but is that bad like altimate Lee that you saw that when you were a kid like maybe maybe it's maybe it's not good to Shield kids from too much yeah but maybe not to that extent show me a cartoon first

<timemark seconds="4346" />

if it affected me it's hard to tell without knowing what it would be like if I didn't see stuff like that but the fact that I remember it vividly so many years later maybe had an affect the negative effect I don't know there's certain experiences that you what you can handle like today as an adult you can see a movie where a guy gets shot and you can handle it does I pick you up if you saw when you were for you probably freak out yeah but is it good to experience that when you're 4 just to let you know it's a thing and now you have a different view of the world or is it good like you're not a parent but as a parent is this the age-old question like how much do you protect your kids break their arm cuz you break your arm you know if you fall you break your arm if you constantly going to die but I don't mind if anybody gets banged up a little bit right right you should I think you should know that if you trip it hurts and it is also you should know that the bullets are real this is Desert

<timemark seconds="4406" />

the thing that happens like with my kids ever since my kids have been really little I've been hunting and so I've been bringing home meat and explain to them that I this is me from an animal that I shot if you go to the supermarket and you buy a steak that came from an animal and I try to get this in there had an early and so then I introduced them to watching a hunting show it to me where we shot a deer and then took the deer part but one like you seen like they're watching us cut an elk apart kids watching this and I'm like well this is where you get meat like when we eat dinner if we eat out for dinner this is exactly where it came from I shot it in the mountains we cut it up we packed it out on our back we put it into a truck we drove somewhere and now we're here now we're eating at this is the air I guess if you present it like that that's I would guess is a good thing maybe but there's something weird about watching a little kid watching animal gets shot with a

<timemark seconds="4466" />

haha yeah right yeah yeah that's an animal like okay like because most kids just it's a hotdog a little kid hey where the cheeseburger coming from though it's from a cow but that's like damn that's like saying the Moon is 1/6 Earth gravity I know that I don't know what the fuck that means no real have a realtor anything so yeah when do you show your kids like like there's a lot of videos that I watch while close my laptop in the kids come here like violent videos like a special like animals like I was watching this video of these hyenas tearing apart this gazelle

<timemark seconds="4521" />

it's fucking horrific The Ripping the guts out all fuck fuck and then my you know my little girl comes over and she's like why you watching and I'm watching the hyena rip apart of gazelles gots just like it's all right yeah yeah yeah so what what kind of what's the difference between that and showing you hunting like is there a I'm doing a quick bite shoot an animal an animal with a bow it's dead and seconds yeah you know it's with a well-placed shot it's not going anywhere like the last elk I shot that one that's right out there on the floor in front of werewolf. In 5 yards in 5 yards tipped over feet up in the air. Shot it right in the heart Wow's perfect shot so it was almost instantaneous death

<timemark seconds="4581" />

might have lived 15 20 seconds and that was it the people I don't know if people don't seem to be shocked that much anymore I know you don't try to keep it from your kids things like that obviously makes sense but it's almost impossible to keep some really horrific shit from people especially if you give you the phone yeah yeah you're giving them access to a lot of nasty stuff and like I remember when I was a kid but the big thing was like Faces of Death I want to go get faces of death man we'll watch it it's crazy guy beat up a monkey and cut his head off and eat the brains and I didn't like yeah that's kind of fake and get to tell the stage things and I think the only real stuff was like news footage of Airline disasters accident since I was one that was real where these These Guys Somewhere in the Middle East tide of these guys arms to one car and his legs to another one and they pulled them

<timemark seconds="4641" />

I can not like watch that shit it's it's terrible and now in stunning HD you can see in a snuff films years ago was kind of an urban myth you know it was a think now they're readily available to anybody in a matter of seconds and I don't know what kind of effect that has on on people and then maybe society and its really nothing to do and auras mean like out so I think it's affecting people though so it's Stephanie Sin City video games as well right now it's in committing violence in video games like Timmy what was that video game where the guy got in trouble cuz you made a video of him torturing some as a punch me punch to a woman in the face that was protesting for supper it and

<timemark seconds="4701" />

and you got in trouble because he posted it and it it was like a violent thing against wet but it's a thing you can do in the game right like they made it in the game so you could do that on purpose and once it became viral people started going up to her in the game and doing even more terrible that there's one where a guy ropes her heart eyes are throws on the back of the horse rides her to a swamp and throws are to an alligator which then eats her and in the swamp that is so crazy that you can do that it's just part of the game that they said well if people want to do it it's a very open-ended game Rockstar went bulshit with this game it's amazing just does it always happen exact same way or do you throw it out there other than spots in the water and get her has a different way of yeah there a different animations for the same thing so and different actually there was one you'll be riding next to a guy that you're supposed to ride somewhere with and

<timemark seconds="4761" />

the guy said something like all right we're almost there something and if you're far away from the guy he yells it guy the voice actor had to do a shitload of text based on what the animation is so I did the voiceover for the UFC game right now for ever and forever you're there for days and days and days reading every single variation of a head kick to an armbar to a takedown to ground-and-pound yeah TKO stop and still kicking someone in the nuts like everything and and someone's got a fucking put that together and then it's got to be coded where it plays at the right time it really is amazing yeah it is it's God damn amazing it's like really insane is this it

<timemark seconds="4821" />

miscarriage of smoking a cigar it's so funny the the things that go on in Escambia the ability to kill people Luis J Gomez on the show and he he plays this and he there's like a morality Direction you can take you can either be a good guy or bad guy really good really bad and it will affect how the course of the game and and whether you wanted whether people are nice to you realize yeah yeah like you could do a favor for somebody you be riding somewhere and someone to go please could you help me out and this is just some guy online geez he fell different things haha kill everybody he killed a guy's dog

<timemark seconds="4881" />

and skinned it in front of them and then shot him in the face like that's really mean that sincerely me dog in front of the guy and the guy is just like crying it's brutal how I mean do you think that most politicians are those people looking for outrageous not aware of this yet yeah absolutely not years ago they were kind of like well it must be violent video game and it was so funny cuz like 10 years after Doom like they're showing doom on TV like oh that's the bad video games like what are you talking about and now like a GTI did some of the voices in GTA promotional songs for the beer at pisswasser beer is great I Dyno Laszlo who does all the sound for the the game but this thing sold like $750 in the first 3 days that came out

<timemark seconds="4941" />

a black man to the KKK they have they have fucking KKK rallies are a part of the game where you have to infiltrate they don't freak out not not in particular that but the job I think the mission here is to just kill all the clan guy that's not like you join up and we'll have a good time seems like it would be more realistic is if you brought a black eye out of the clan me they try to kill a black eye right right but that would be that would be crazy there are some weird Parts in it where they're very a misogynistic cuz it's supposed to be like 1899 or something and it's very misogynistic and then there's some race references that they make that are kind of like wow that's that's bold about black guy like they'll call him boy and some of the tile like a non-player character will pass my it would be kind of nasty and they never presented in a good way it's not lie

Jello cool this guy's great it's always some scumbag. Character are there such a lack of awareness on the part of a lot of people like I I get games the day they come actually before I get Alpha Testing beta testing I'm playing the games months before they come out really enjoy it I love it I can get it on that you sign up for the ultimate package on Origin or Steam and you get access to the games when they say yeah yeah it's obviously they would want to make some some money and I want to play the games early they automatically kind of have something in place that will let them know if there's a problem or you can email me say hey that you know I died and I'm stuck in a rock now up to my waist have you ever talk to someone

<timemark seconds="5061" />

make those things you ever have them on your show I got Laszlo works at Rockstar he's the sound engineer guy he did record the sound but he's involved in like every aspect of all those games from the beginning of Grand Theft Auto the first Red Dead Red Dead 2 and it's amazing I've been to Rockstar in New York and took a tour of the place it's just a bunch of sitting around they have a day where you know you can bring your dogs in and it's all wide open no cubicles or anyting the guys that run it over these English guys and they're brilliant or New Zealand or something one of those weird accents that you can't tell where it's for up to work insane hours. They are dedicated like a game like like a rockstar game GTA or that it's so above other games like like you can't even do I play some shity game where I download it I start playing and within 5 minutes

<timemark seconds="5121" />

I got fuck this sucks like it just you know it sucks right and Rockstar Games or just you know it sounds like I'm doing a spot for him but they're so above everything else the animation the FBI sandbox quality where you're able to just run around and do shit like that's an appeal that I don't like feeling like they're on a track in a game and certain games are like that like Call of Duty is very track based you know yet you play online a lot against other people they're small Maps but a game like that you can just go off if you want to you can just spend time fishing like you could just get tackle and go to a lake and fish catch fish you catch fish it it's yeah I've heard that attract like the bear and and that mother can you saw that can get you I love games like that though I love opening to the game I always like that shit even when I was back in the 80s

<timemark seconds="5181" />

but my cousin got a Atari 800 computer and it had a cartridge for game called a star Raiders and this was like right after Star Wars came out and I was fascinated because it wasn't just a joystick and a button that you got on an arcade game it was you use the keyboard like for warp-drive or you had a dock with a space station at one point and you're going in orbit around a planet like there was all these things that you used the keyboard for and I thought that was amazing like I don't like just a run-and-gun type thing I like being able to use a lot of different keys and have a lot of options how much time do you spend playing video games days where I have weekends or something where I have played from maybe 2 p.m. till 3 a.m. like 1213 hours of a plan it it's no eating

<timemark seconds="5240" />

yeah yeah I'll have a little snack a little snack I'll order something or missy I'll make something she's playing video games sure that like I'll be playing on the computer and that's in front of me on the table every song on living room and then on the big screen TV which is in front of me on the wall she's sitting in it like a folding chair with a TV tray playing Red Dead Redemption on the Xbox so easily look right. How you doing a video of a couple engaging in virtual reality and they're having sex in the girls blowing the guy in the video Joey Diaz comes in the room. It's sucking a guy's dick that out I haven't it's really interesting there there there is some that is pretty amazing like a girl will come up

<timemark seconds="5300" />

like you're laying on your back and a girl is in the room she takes her clothes off and comes up on you and gets right by your ear and unlike whisper something it and you hear it you almost feel the breath on you it's that fucking crazy and and you are you feel like you can reach it and touch but yeah there's not no one there but then again you can't even get close to showing What It's Like on a regular flat screen but when you put that and it's a real space it's 3D and they look pretty real aside from the resolution difference between see when you when you magnify something close your eyes does the pixels get bigger too so it's not quite there but you can see where that's going you get that and one of those fucking fleshlights I used to really really early version of the HTC Vive many years ago Duncan had one my friend Duncan Trussell had one in his house and it was really pixelated and it was very

<timemark seconds="5360" />

strange it was just a real simple game and it was real blocky looking look like like old Doom or something to write but it was in complete three dimensions and so I was looking up and looking all around like wow this is kind of crazy and then I went back to his place like 2 years later and there's been a gigantic leap an improvement and now the leaf is sort of bounced out it's not it's it hasn't gotten that much better yet yet yeah there are a few games that I love playing on on the the Oculus because it's not like flying games are incredible and if you have a really good system with the I like dual 1080 TI graphics cards and one of them is insane Tab and my sister has two of them so I can run everything on Ultra so do you prefer videos on a computer I prefer PC but I'll play on Xbox and stuff it's pretty cool I'm packed terrible with a controller

<timemark seconds="5419" />

what's the problem right now I've never missed a folder on my desktop but there's something called an 8-pack Zim Apex that you plug into an Xbox or Playstation and then plug keyboard mouse into it you're running on Xbox with a keyboard and mouse so and it's so good I destroy people when I play on that and reflexes and I came from the online video game days of the early 2000s in the 90s like it was always computer's mouse and keyboard was was it a console was for babies yeah good back then she was terrible yeah I went when I play some of the combat flying games they have things now that

<timemark seconds="5479" />

you look like you're in the cockpit of a plane all the gauges work they have reflections of light coming through I mean the ground looks amazing and NVR when you pull the stick back and turn cuz I use a joystick and throttle it's amazing you can look over your shoulder and now you're seeing your wing and the ground and you're pulling back and you get dizzy like you get so fucking busy and rashes are startling if you lose control your plow into the ground you kind of jump cuz it's you just it's I think it's a primal part of your head going like accepting what what it's saying I wonder if they'll be a really good way to learn how to fly I would imagine it would be that guy that stole that plane up in that was a Portland recently he said he learned how to fly on a semi of flight simulator Microsoft Flight Simulator X

<timemark seconds="5539" />

what is like unbelievable he was doing like loop-de-loops in the sky and see if we could do a loop and he was saying is I'm going to kill myself to do a loop in the nose it in and call it the fact that he could get access and take off like that is kind of scary whoops we all think you know everything so secure then we thought they were like missiles on the roof of the White House and the Pentagon of stuff in it after 9/11 like yeah I guess not I guess that was all bullshit the actual Pentagon got hit by a fucking plane although now you're going to get a lot of people writing was it was a Miss show everyone knows that you're a gatekeeper doesn't tell who does your show that is a flat earther Eddie Bravo Eddie Bravo that's it I don't know if he still flattered that you might have a band and they might have moved on

<timemark seconds="5599" />

we think they still he thought the Earth is a maybe he said I think I don't want to miss interpret what he saying I don't want to miss represent I think he was saying he doesn't know but he doesn't believe NASA because it's only someone's word / history and he likes that spits he thinks it's fun he just conspiracies are can yeah they are kind of fun but that Flat Earth one I realized I was arguing with flat earthers on Twitter and that's when I really started going like what what what am I doing what am I doing why am I engaging that was like the dumbest version of I know you are but what am I for the rest of time yes it's crazy and Neil deGrasse Tyson was taping his show in my studio before I came on so he was in the lobby when I was in our Green Room when when I was on I start talking about it

<timemark seconds="5659" />

and I go you know let's get someone in here maybe that might have an opinion on this Neil deGrasse Tyson, and apparently he gets shit all the time from Flat earthers saying that it's you know he's full of shit do it all started off as a goof. Did it yeah like three bleeding yes exactly explain that people don't know free bleeding is a woman's rights thing and it's instead of using a tampon during their period or pad they just bleed through their pants and show it probably that they will walk around bleeding and it was never real it was never real thing at end of people saw it and thought it was real like they did put it out there for Chan and people actually believe and no not just believed it started operating it yes they started doing it at real they've turned it into some women's rights are white pants on the Giant

<timemark seconds="5719" />

brownish red in the center

<timemark seconds="5723" />

say crazy just shows you how easily manipulated people are they yeah we're talking about this last time I was with you right the proud boys yeah yeah yeah and then became like what that means they won't let him in Australia now if you seen that no it's it's gotten insane like Gavin is considered like a war criminal at this point I know Gavin very well he used to be on compound media my my network and that's where the whole thing started and it's it's amazing what do you think about it because everything like how did how did Nazi Germany stop was that a joke was that like stalinism and ever in Russia Gavin how to show very outrageous Gavin is one of these just a funny outrageous

<timemark seconds="5783" />

his whole career has been based on satire and parody and provocateur solutely love shaking to be hard to find out where he really and when he's playing games right it's very blurry absolutely so we have we had this employee Ben Ratner little kid we actually hired him just because his name is Ratner and we wanted to call him rat like in Fast Times a red why don't you turn on the camera so it was it was great rat never talk about girls like this really Jewish real red hair kind of gangly you know kid and he like going to Broadway shows and things and we always questioned his sexuality and what not and I Gavin really started hitting on him going what are you doing like get laid the kids your age should be out there you just fucking plowing through pussy and he's like

<timemark seconds="5843" />

the right girl are they continuously goof on them so he would always go to Broadway play so Gavin started getting music from musicals and playing it to him like Hey look at this your pussy you know is this what you like and one of them was proud of your boy it's a Broadway a song from a musical Disney musical I believe and it's all proud of your boy it's one of those big grandiose Broadway pieces of shit so he goes down about that and then said we ought to make a club called The Proud boys and that way you can learn how to be a man and you know you will get checks and tattoos and you know drink beer and hang out with guys

<timemark seconds="5896" />

as a joke it was like this parody of a men's club and so over-the-top that it was like I think part of the way to get beaten into this Gang This Club was that you had to recite five breakfast cereals while the other members punched you and and they would keep punching you until you spit up so ludicrous so ridiculous such a parody and slowly this fucking thing mutated into something got more members they started wearing what are those shirts with the yellow piping on the collar and it's a specific shirt that became the uniform Perry Ellis Perry Ellis shirts a specific black shirt with gold piping and on the collar and and the the sleeves and that became like the uniform

<timemark seconds="5950" />

and because it was presented as a chauvinistic club like like girls are allowed minorities are allowed it doesn't matter who you are but in essence it is a guy thing and we will talk shit about girls and we're going to drink and get laid and it's just a man thing so they started getting together with bars in the area in Manhattan and how is this organized organized through his compound media show the compound media showing his own Twitter account and on Facebook which he subsequently lost persona non grata on social media but that's how it started and it never was supposed to go any further than that Gavin himself didn't really take it any further than that it's just let's get together every so often we have a good time we drink laugh everything like that will then this whole thing with politics got about this and Tifa which is anti-fascist started

<timemark seconds="6010" />

coming into conservatives that wanted to speak so Gavin was conservative is conservative he get speaking engagements at schools and why you or on any any of numerous places around New York City and Auntie foul would show up to protest him and try to shut down the event so then the proud boys would go and protect Gavin so he wouldn't get harmed doing these speaking engagements and that so then it turned into this because they're fighting with anti fog they must be the fall the fascists and Nazis and once that gets out there there's no pulling it back you could try to explain how you're not a Nazi till you're blue in the fucking face it ain't going away right especially cuz it's a good story to press likes it so it's good versus evil think they present Auntie fi like their protest they are gone and the protesters were beating

<timemark seconds="6070" />

they're fucking violent violent group of people that are there too to hit people they don't agree with and silence people that want to speak and that's exactly what happened with Gavin and Ann Coulter and Milo yiannopoulos Ben Shapiro that a lot of these conservative people can't go to these venues in speak they can get shut down because of a violent group of people called anybody so proud boys were kind of the answer that so Gavin could go round and actually speak well when that happened more people came on board cuz they kind of like to beat people up when you have a gang a group of people and one of their missions is now to beat up people you don't agree with politically when they was TLX there was tears to the membership like the highest tier was he fought for the costs right right actually get in a fist fight yeah yes I'm sure Gavin thought was like I've talked to Kevin I like Gavin I've had Gavin on the podcast and the last time I had them on I didn't know what this whole

<timemark seconds="6130" />

nothing was and so I use explaining the proud boys and he was talk to me about we're going to punch them we're going to punch people yes I well well well I was like did you know you can just punch people they punch back and then you get to get mad at you punch them in they shoot you when you get out of your car right like this escalates people don't just take it well it was never supposed to be on offencive punching went when I would speak to Gavin and every example I would see it was an answer to violence they they would have violence perpetrated on that context and all all needed to say is he's calling for violence that's it and that's what they said about Gavin over and over again like taking things out of context and use it as a gap the other problem being that the anti people are a lot of skinny dudes and chicks with masks on and they are not really that Adept at fighting does a horrible video of this one and two forgot tries to hit someone with it looks like some kind of a stick or a pipe yeah and the guy catches it

<timemark seconds="6190" />

fucking blast him on the champion fucking put him down his head bounce off of concrete unconscious yet I told him with his bare hands getting his fucking head hit his head on the concrete you got hit by the world it's literally the world gravity has punched you in the back of the head yes these people have this idea that they're going to go places they're going to shut everybody down it because they're in a group scream and yell and hit people with bike locks and all this thing is that that's from the left that was never from the left before when I was a kid I grew up when I was from 8 to 7:11 during the Vietnam war and I lived in San Francisco and I was around the real hippies and I remember being a little kid and I don't have that kind of time like they were flower of children I mean they would they write the hippies and the lefties were were the love and peace and no violence and everyone was doing

<timemark seconds="6250" />

acid and now they're all an adderal and hitting people with bike locks it was yeah it's a different thing there was a time where the Liberals the hippies they were the ones that when they would be a demonstration and and the National Guard would show up they be putting flowers in the battles of the guns famous pictures of that and then Kent State was a bunch of hippies literally getting shot by the National Guard National Guard that has completely flipped around it's the weirdest thing and I don't know how it got this thing as we're proud boys became this evil group of people and an anti fog is the good group of people that I understand that proud boy boys were infiltrated by white nationalist yes not see white supremacist whatever it is but those were constantly being disappointed by Gavin Gavin never wanted any of that happening how do you get in though here's a question

<timemark seconds="6310" />

this is my you saw my last comedy special about vegans it's not that there is anything wrong with being a vegan rice that when you have a group where anybody can join you can get a certain amount of fucking idiots right if you have a million people for sure you have a hundred thousand fucking idiot there's no getting around that yeah so if you have a group or anybody can join and you have a million people in that group you're going to have a hundred thousand fucking idiot idiot and those people going to Define your group The Worst Behavior in that group is people going to call to as an example that's it I think this is also a symptom of the social media error today especially with Twitter because you can't express yourself explain things I 140 or 280 characters much time so they can say proud boys racist scumbag naughty Gavin

<timemark seconds="6370" />

beat up the antifa yes fucking asshole asshole yeah that's that's what it is down to I've seen it presented ask how it starts and how it grows and how you become a member by buying a fucking shirt that's why buying a Perry Ellis shirt and opening a chapter 2 there a chapters worldwide you see it it's like here's the be proud boys Australia here's a proud boys England proud boys fucking Japan like it's everywhere and it never was supposed to get to that point and regardless of how these people act it now reflects on Gavin even though he wanted to hang out in the bar with a few people do his public speaking without being Hassle and that's it and and I see the way the media manipulates things I've been party to it myself and I've seen Gavin presented in photos where you look and go ho Lee fuk it's Hitler like like they get him there's one thing

<timemark seconds="6430" />

Gavin that I was petrified by he's got his arms folded he's got a scowl on his face that hair you know the short on the side long on the top and he's looking like like he's angry and I'm like that that's not the guy that him and his wife was American Indian by the way he's got beautiful kids that come over my house and use the pool and we hang out and barbecue I'm like that's not that guy no one knows that guy from the paper they're getting this impression he's a really nice guy he's he's generous just a really cool guy to hang out with and what you see them do in the media is just crazy especially when you know he didn't invent some goddamn Nazi group he was just trying to have a little outrageous fun and it ran from it got away from the origin of it though the way you're describing that is fucking fantastic isn't that crazy that that is what presented it emerged

<timemark seconds="6490" />

it took him out of that we we we fuck with rat all the time because we go can you believe the inspiration for the proud boys is this little Jewish oh I'm sure there is yeah yeah rat rat compound media rat you'll probably find them how much does it's weird you out though that compound media was the source of all this is weird like and it's one of those things to worry about like like I don't want it then be tight cuz I know how it works I love Gavin but I don't have you tied to the proud boys at this point you know I got my own fucking problems through history I don't need any more up piled on me what was that thing that I sent you that. That was I was with the mayor from Jaws mayor Vaughn I was for Halloween that's the guy

<timemark seconds="6550" />

I hate propaganda poster Norman Rockwell painting he should be there an apple pie face of the Nazi movement so I think there's a lot of mistakes were made you know but Gavin's Gavin's made some mistakes and it like his his whole thing not a blurring the lines between parody and honestly he thinks it's fun it's very punk rock he came out last time he's on the podcast was a few years back he came on dressed like Michael Douglas from falling down hit a briefcase you brought the suit like to have the short sleeve shirt around I just did a Skype interview with him yesterday two days ago at from the hotel room and he at he's got the pocket protector and a pens and the glasses yeah like falling down thinks it's funny I need to understand and this is true he is the Godfather of the

<timemark seconds="6610" />

hipsters hipsters in Google wardrobe the guys are wearing the McGinnis yeah literally started that Fashion Trend in Williamsburg yeah and they it took off from there that the Hipster dress the way people dressed with those weird mustaches and all that shit yeah that literally came out of Gavin Gavin it which is amazing the mother fucker is he is like a got ya well either something like magnetic about the guy he is what a cult leader is like he could just start a cult which in essence by accident he did between the hipsters and then this he's one of those guys like Gavin why don't you start why don't you start app called where you get to fuck the people's wives like that kind of felt like he also did some really good interviews online where he would trick these leftist

<timemark seconds="6670" />

into sitting down with him and interviews again along the way they're having this conversation it would be exposed that he didn't agree with them at all they were trapped like this hardcore feminist got trapped with them and yeah couple other people get trapped in this room with him and then they realize I Catholic some of the line of questioning in the way he's approaching things like oh my God like he's an interesting guy he's very interesting outside of his problem is he never never invented that you'll be doing great yeah although he had a problem with one of his own companies that he made after Vice they bought him out of Vice because Shane turned more liberal and and it wasn't really that they weren't really messing anymore over their advice so they kind of just bought out Gavin he got a lot of money decide to do his own thing he had an advertising firm I guess it was and then he got the boot from that for making trends

<timemark seconds="6730" />

gender comments he was he was saying some things that are correct yeah just Center Sparks with again yeah I already in sarcasm in his mind this was like just this is something you can talk about where it was in the public side particularly during the Caitlyn Jenner yeah whole things people have decided the transgender was amazing it's amazing it's beautiful she's incredible and he was saying no these are people that are mentally ill and there's a there's a website that he was pointing to I think it's called transgender regrets or something like that all these stories of all these men who turned into women and turn back to man again now they don't have dicks and they have to take testosterone injections and they hate their life and their sum of who did it like in the winter in their 60s and now it's now they're in their seventies and trying to be a man again and and that gender dysphoria was thought to be a mental health issue like anorexia

<timemark seconds="6790" />

like a lot of other right there's no body dysphoria be people have weird you know what bodybuilders get it they did they never think they're big enough for right actions of their physical presence in their mean and some ladder psychologist dr. Deborah so who was discussing late onset gender dysphoria in autistic girls that autistic teenage girls they don't feel like they fit in and people can convince them that they're actually a man wow so a lot of them start taking hormones and it and and going through transition have massive regrets and then unfortunately for women when is specially when you're a teenager and you're going through puberty and you take hormones you will literally start developing male features your face gets harder and thicker and wider your shoulders get bigger than the whole deal your hands yeah gross the size of a thumb you so you do you make these irreversible changes or if you just described

<timemark seconds="6850" />

this is a perfect Jim Norton's I love him to death he's a pretty good example to of some of those bulletproof because that's what he is he said he's Charming I like in his his fucking debauchery and he still has a Charming. Yes girls love them and think he's adorable when he sang some of those heinous shit on stage and turn on the air. You know where he's coming from Yeah Yeah Yeahs mistaking I like he he wears everything honestly so he wrote the foreword and in my book permanently suspended he knows me like it's my brother first and then Jim Norton Jim knows me really well we're we're really good friends and I love the guy why didn't you guys wind up doing a show together when open Anthony crashed

<timemark seconds="6902" />

I think look I can't blame anybody because I think they have in the security of a steady paycheck as opposed to the guy that just got thrown off of everything opening starting his own thing probably wasn't all that appealing to Jimmy who you know you just bought a new place in the city and everything is it just it wasn't the right time and then you know as time went on he became the go to guy over at serious from the Opie and Anthony show so I would love to and I do is to chip chipperson show and yeah we're doing we're doing one in Philly next week and it's hilarious fucking wild and he's got to be in character the whole time it's got to kill him it's got to kill him and and it's so much fun to do I love playing the The Straight Guy

<timemark seconds="6962" />

co-host to his fucking insane character but yeah we've done these live shows and they're there really a lot of fun and he's just the easy way to dice an outfit oh my God it's so ridiculous he's got to stay in those pants packed and it's crazy you guys reading what are the notes he wanted us to he wrote he wrote like a almost a play but it's all just kissing chips ass and how wonderful GIF is and how thankful we are happy that like it's so goddamn funny I love it he's he's brilliant man he's just a great guy and very fucking funny I knew from the first I think that also I kind of am not blaming Jimmy or anything but I think that helped

<timemark seconds="7017" />

Shekinah break up the Ona show in time I think I'll be started resenting a little bit of that camaraderie that me and Jimmy were having me and Jimmy kind of slowly started pulling away and doing our own thing like it was and the humor is more Twisted the better I love sick humor he does too and we laugh we did a whole bit on like Laci Peterson and Scott Peterson the murderer yeah and you would think like obviously he murdered his pregnant wife and dumped her in the ocean what could possibly be funny about that

<timemark seconds="7052" />

what people wrote tribute songs with this guy wrote a tribute song to her and another one is self-centered assholes I thought he was going to go viral by making a tribute and it we started changing the words to the song to make it just horrible involving seaweed and and things up so it's terrible but me and she literally crying laughing and always just kind of sitting there like not really able to jump in or not kind of getting why we're laughing at this sick shit so it kind of pushed us further apart at that point yeah we both as people changed over the course of the 20 years we work together

<timemark seconds="7093" />

25 years with anybody dude is nuts you got a girl that suck your dick everyday for 20 years you're going to be like off fuck stop sucking my dick butt from Megan so you going to get on each others nerves and I I'm not innocent in the holding either but I was I'm a lot more laid back like I I knew what real work was I work for fucking living I did heating and air conditioning installation and it was freezing cold in the winter and boiling hot in the summer and when I got that first gig and radio because of Opie and I'll always thank him for that I knew what it was like to work and I didn't want to fuck that up so I plaster the smile on my face at every turn and did the show four hours a day everyone has someone at work that they don't get along with you don't believe you'll fucking ghetto you just deal with it and that's 8 hours 20 hours of the day that involve Gregg Opie Hughes

<timemark seconds="7154" />

I could deal with it he was more like he had to express himself a little more which guy gets his healthy in a way but I didn't need to so I didn't I didn't text him I didn't call him we got in an argument wants to go see dude you never even been to my house and I got all right get everyone from the show in here Jim have I ever been a house note Travis no Sam no erock no I've never been to anyone's house right now that's how much it would say it's exactly the type of relationship I see the moon your house why didn't you ask me to come to your house yeah is there a like you asked me everyday and I'm saying no every time I say no right right what's going on it was always something like that and believe me I'm not going to sit here and shit on the guy

<timemark seconds="7214" />

I got my shows for that but there were definitely personality quirks and that I guess we both had but there was something like it if I would party all the time and end yeah I had to be there at 6 a.m. and I'm driving from Roslyn Long Island to New York City it's it's 25 30 miles of just fucked traffic everyday it could be 35 minutes it could be an hour and a half based on if someone pulled over on the side of the road some asshole crashes in Queens whatever it was it was it was a shit Drive everyday and you had to be there at 6 or a 6 the show started and so even at 6 to be that kind of traffic yeah yeah it wasn't as bad as it got it like 7 or 8 but it you never really knew it could it could I was never late late but there were times I come in at 5 after 8 after 6 was pretty

<timemark seconds="7274" />

as late as I would I would be it was never more than that but he would go like he never had to say anything like this music starts does a little bumper at the beginning and by the time it's time I sit down and he on Mike would go well I guess there was traffic Anthony just getting in and all the bosses are listening and it was it just wasn't necessary to do that you know it kind of is like 200 something got to be asked about guys don't do that guys don't do that to each other you fucking sit-down don't say a word no one would know I'm late you know and that's what happened and it said they were instances like that all the time it's all in my book permanently suspended there's that book out now it's out now at Barnes & Noble yes very good but I talked to my house I talk a lot about obviously the relationship and end with o p and end

<timemark seconds="7334" />

how it kind of slowly came apart at the seams I think toward the end he just a tad if he didn't want to do a show it with me anymore I don't do you want to do what you did me either that didn't last long and I knew it wasn't going to last one they I was the buffer between the two of them that ended bad it really did it really did have you talked to Jimmy about it like yeah yeah he doesn't he doesn't Express that kind of no no he doesn't like Jimmy's a very loyalty driven guy like he takes that very seriously and if he feels somebody's fucking with him he really gets pissed usually it can get talked out and everything's cool after a little while but this one who farted I didn't work I think honestly the way you guys interact with each other what he was good for was sort of directing the whole thing

<timemark seconds="7393" />

the impression that I got in the I mean how many times do I do the show doesn't yeah yeah absolutely guide things like sit back more let you guys be funny but but guide like figure out like maybe we need more of this maybe we need more of that real value to that absolutely but do you think that's fun when you go out and do an appearance and everyone's clamoring about a bit that me and Jimmy did or something yeah and he's sitting there going like well I pushed a button and I drove the ship and I went to spots and if he knew it's it's it's funny cuz like yeah you're not going to be appreciated right as much but it's like a guy who is good at defense we doesn't score a lot of points yeah yeah yeah you're not going to be LeBron James it's necessary or the ones who everybody wants to talk to you yeah

<timemark seconds="7453" />

Mercy I think of all feel like you're see the prestige the movie The Prestige with the the two magicians it's it's a good movie it's a good move at one point because he has to use a body double the actual magician as to drop below the stage and the body double comes out and gets all the Applause and he's under the stage the real guy that did the whole Act is under the stage and he shuts his eyes and puts his arms out like trying to enjoy the adulation from the fans but it's not even him getting it and I think that kind of mindset was there there's and then resentment starts bubbling up and you start doing things like saying Anthony just got in you hold things over people's heads that the contract negotiations were a nightmare every time and Opie always wanted a one

<timemark seconds="7513" />

your deal I'm like what the fuck you doing let's sign for 10 years who gives a shit you know if they want to fire they going to fight anyway contract or not but let's lock them in so if something happens at least we have a settlement portion we can take half the the what they always for 5 years whatever it is not one year deal that's all I want because you always had this delusion of grandeur like there was always something better waiting for us to grab up and it's like the truth no matter was the glory years ago an issue or gone but New Years and you know all that crazy fucking radio we were damaged goods after the sex in St Patrick's Cathedral debacle week we had a couple people had to go around New York City and have sex at at various famous location but the Hard Rock Cafe in Empire State Building things like that we have spotters who was Comics or people that work for the show follow them around and they would call us on the showing up

<timemark seconds="7573" />

building and he's doing it I'm watching it right now so we have Paul Mercurio who is a comic and and he was following one couple around and church on the list and I went like I don't know man it's just to read on the air and say what like what locations are and when we say church people to like Paul calls up and goes well we're here at St Pats and he's doing the two-point conversion you got an extra two points if you were fucking her in the ass at the location they all have Point values for how dangerous it was to be sure that it was a lot of theater of the mind going on to it we were doing or where I hear it was in the vestibule outside same path but regardless it's sex at st. Pat's

<timemark seconds="7633" />

and I meet up we looked at each other we both had digital delay it like the delay button 7 second we have like a 30 second delay we both had buttons in front of us there was another guy in a locked room down the hall that had a button to dump out of cuz we constantly doing shit that would have gotten FCC complaints so the boss install these buttons everywhere what we both had our finger on it, like shit do we punch out of this it's hilarious that's fucking his girl in the ass at st. Pat's and neither of us hit the button and forgot down the hall didn't hit it we just went with it at that moment it's like that is one of those moments like talk about a defining moment you move your finger one in down and that never happens it it's amazing to it to think about what year was this a 2002 I believe 2000 it was it was 9/11

<timemark seconds="7688" />

thought we went through 911 on the air and stuff and then I guess that summer maybe what year did you guys wind up on XM 2004 I think it was we had to sit out to fucking years out of our contract not working they didn't want us to go to mornings cuz Clear Channel radio which was another radio company and CBS were we're kind of fighting for us Clear Channel wanted us to do mornings against Howard Stern who was on CBS we work for CVS at the time doing afternoons so we we were put in a position where they were both just throwing a huge amounts of money at us and CBS was like we can't let them go to morning so it would be impossible to beat Howard but we would take enough listeners the way where you might not be number one anymore that affect Revenue you know you want if you want to sell the show as the number one rated show so she is doing anything they could to keep us in afternoons with the same company as how

<timemark seconds="7748" />

it was the most lucrative contract we ever signed it was a three-year deal we signed it in August 2001

<timemark seconds="7757" />

and after one year they cancelled the show because of the sex at st. Pat's thing that blew up I made it was in the newspaper as it was I had to look at OB and Dopey on the front page of Dopey Dopey nuts CBS was like well we canceled your show but we're not letting you out of your contract I like what does that mean we've talked to her age and he goes well you can't work there not letting me work you'll still get paid and dude I'm talking millions of dollars this was millions of dollars that they had to give us for 2 years but you think like oh that's awesome back then there was no internet to speak of like that you have no way to contact your fans will you can have a website which is what he had one of the ways that we became friends cuz I wrote about you guys right yeah yeah I wrote a big piece on my website about how we kick it and was yeah yeah a lot of people

<timemark seconds="7817" />

Florida Dustin but it got in two years you just disappear on the radio it it's if you're not doing a show in your ad that you will go away they will find something else so we were really worried about that at again damage good so no one was really clamoring to hire us anyway but we went through two years where I was just making huge amounts of money and just buying toys I would go. I went to Atlantis for a couple of weeks and in the Bahamas and I was little I was pulling my luggage to leave at at the the desk and I go to my check I got what are we where why we going home it was okay I said can I have the room if it for another 2 weeks like okay went back upstairs and just stay for a month like I have no reason why am I going home after 2 weeks you so conditioned like how long a vacation is that lasted for it for 2 years and then satellite Came Calling

<timemark seconds="7877" />

we considered radio prison at that was radio jail anybody that cuz everyone that it's fucked up and regular video ended up in Satellite like don't want it to be in satellite radio with the time they had no subscribers me know peace out on the side of the Belt Parkway wants by my house in Brooklyn and we were like let's see how many satellite radio antennas we see cuz I used to be very obvious shark fin big antennas aftermarket is stuck them in drilling into your roof it was terrible was stupid no one wanted to get fucked their car up with this dumb antenna so we're looking at me like nothing and then look there's one and you know the money is one thing obviously but as a broadcaster you want to fucking be talking to people you know you want you want to entertain people you want people to say wow that was good and there was just no subscribers back then

<timemark seconds="7931" />

during our 10 years they're it wound up getting very very good and and we had a lot of listeners but early on no one but satellite was calling and we we signed you know we signed the deal but we we definitely would have preferred terrestrial radio it's on Howard town on it and people talking about it and then it became a big thing because every new car you would buy you get a free 90 days whatever but now is a shit yeah it's it's one of the most short-lived Technologies not that it's gone I think it'll always be there to something acidy it is fucking clinging by a thread so many other that's why they bought Pandora I guess there so many other streaming Outlets out there and the fact in podcast the fact that pot has her all free

<timemark seconds="7991" />

remember where it doesn't show me the route on you and you get that signal constantly now so it's it's not like the old days every time you get in the car like your system identifies your phone and then successfully in commercials I remember they start playing commercials like what the fuck is this I'm paying so you can play commercial tea out of your fucking mind yeah that was It was supposed to be commercial-free they don't check if you listen to 70s on 7 I guess you won't have to listen to the commercial but I think they started throwing commercials on everything so yeah yeah short-lived Technologies weird and then to put all of your eggs in a couple of baskets that are circling the earth always seems weird to me that you can't get it in Hawaii I think I can get to Hawaii on vacation I got a car that had serious

<timemark seconds="8051" />

built into it it didn't work yeah yeah it's like what the fuck is this you have to deal with a satellite orbiting they get out something happens to the transmitter on a terrestrial station they send an engineer up there he turns a few screws or what-have-you you know something fucks up in a satellite what you going to do a rocket and fix the dumb technology at this point yeah yeah totally unnecessary unnecessary fact that serious is still transmitted from a thing in the sky down to the ground yeah yeah and then it's transmitted from the people on the ground up into the sky and then back down to the people on the ground yeah yeah that's what's going on it's just so unnecessary just the people on the ground could just send it to the people on the ground on the ground why would you do especially in this day and age with but they still doing it it's very weird yeah yeah it is they're going to have to do something for their model I don't know like I said by Pandora

<timemark seconds="8111" />

yup I internet companies but yeah I think that's all there is still a thing that's the weirdest thing to be the death knell for radio it's been it's been forever like the second another technology came out I was like yeah the amazing invention he was supposed to be but it's just hangs in there people just can't let it go regular radio especially am may I remember as a kid my dad haven't liked music on the a.m. radio satellite was coming out of a tin can static and shit that was kind of all you had I drove home at like a year ago and just on a goof I decided to put on AM radio and I was listening to an AM radio show that had a big smile on my face all the way home cuz I was like I was listening to the

<timemark seconds="8171" />

yeah yes I got time machine right I was some weird one of the local talk shows a weird local talk show in LA but they were talking about traffic in the Dodgers game and it's archaic so strange like first of all anything with anything that is trying to inform you is just unnecessary at this point unless it's fake news that the big CNN and Fox News everything goes will always be a fixture and stuff but local fucking news do you really need the team that cares at 6 it's all just shit that you've already seen online there's that one story that will be on the 6 news that I don't already know in depth it's also the lowest rung of show business in terms of competence terrible at it and they're all drunks it's hilarious I have never seen

<timemark seconds="8231" />

group of people that can drink more than fucking news people they they just get hammered constantly or miserable I think that's it I think they're just in the right after she got fired she announced she was going to come on the podcast and so started showing up where are old studio is actually they went to our old studio and they are parked out front with cameras and this is what I got I got upset you guys are terrible at this and second of all you just assume that because you're there I have to talk to you so because you see me I'm going to say something to you cuz you put your camera and your microphone face it doesn't work that way fuck face like a really good job doing this because you're not good at this you will one day get a really good job doing this or you're just not good at it one of those because right now you're right here and I'm not talking to you

<timemark seconds="8291" />

this is nonsense like you're holding his fucking camera hi we're here with Simms CBS 4 news like to talk to you you now sometimes they feel like you're obligated to address that might want to come to my house neighbor's doors and then want to know about me and stuff and if you think like like we deal with LA or New York imagine what that the news team in fucking East Alabama fuck like that's got to be the worst they are just terrible at what they do local news in some Podunk fuck town is hilarious to watch you, except to do when you coming to a town to do local TV shows morning good morning Chat thing as shity as you think the view is resin talk

<timemark seconds="8351" />

hens get together and buy these shows in like the local one in Boise Idaho or just terrible and I hate that there's such a double standard when one of them fucks up when a news person fucks up they just apparently leave me alone like where was everyone with the what's his name from from was at NBC Brian Williams well Brian Williams that kind of got on but no it was in the news writing but where was where was the bike being shoved in Matt Lauer's face as he's trying to fucking go home or something I think you just hit me when you went straight to Long Island and went to The Hamptons and he's never left but were they camping out in front of his house like like they were twisted

<timemark seconds="8411" />

is how much money he made oh yeah like I didn't know he was making that much money like that is insane and four years at like a giant Ranch in New Zealand it's like thousands of Acres I could decide you need that it's so crazy because he's got some access issues like the people that want to get to certain parts of the public land they have to go through his Ranch so there's like an access issue like some sort of these people are supposed to be with drive-through near their fight it off and he should just sit at his desk with that button that opens the door but it is the gate up so they could get through this exception about that but they all had that button on a phone call so they get bank checks in the office like women Executives had that button to

<timemark seconds="8471" />

lock it looks like you sitting there when I fuck I want to be interrupted some nervous girl just hit the button down there was a lot of that it was like accentuated like there was a one guest that brought in a bunch of sex toys and he was like how he keeps a bag of sex toys in his office in this office I got a flame thrower okay Elon Musk gave me a flamethrower flamethrower in his office yes it's that kind of thing for somebody gave me a bag of dildos it would be right over there next to the flamethrower I found it would wind up getting tossed but Matt Lauer decided to keep it in his fucking closet he gave some people so I think the guy was getting laid that's what

<timemark seconds="8531" />

and I think a lot of what else happened that other than the details of it it seems to me that it's it's all of it is like very blown out of proportion I don't like that that that's happening because it everyone is being lumped into the Harvey Weinstein category which is the number one who said this on CNN or one of those talk shows she said he may very well be the biggest serial rapist in history from you even such a silly sitting back on my couch going

<timemark seconds="8572" />

yeah Bill Cosby's the biggest serial rapist yesterday

<timemark seconds="8578" />

wow at a time machine would be wonderful just to see people's Expressions when you tell him like what's happening in the hole celebrity of forum like like what we have photo of Howard Cosell Bruce Jenner and OJ Simpson fucking crazy when we were kids we used to watch The Cosby Show when it was when he was Bill Cosby the stand-up comedian ever go on HBO and everybody loved him he was America's America's dad right there The Cosby Show revolutionary on television he was at that time raping raping them but drugging yeah and it in Denver friend's daughter's like to come on over I'll help you with your career

<timemark seconds="8638" />

you feeling okay put your feet up put your feet up and then regain Consciousness for a minute just remember seeing old Bill pounding away for that fucking flounder I I think you got the eye later in life I think I'm not sure I thought they were using that it's kind of a sympathy thing but he looks pretty fucking flying him the same deal they sent Whitey Bulger oh wow he was what 95 or something like that why do I told her was I think it was that fucking all like in his 90s that's all that's a grudge that someone held onto for quite a while other guy hated rats apparently and that was the thing that Whitey Bulger alternative time of running the Irish mob was riding people out there that's what was really crazy he was another guy just like we were talking about

<timemark seconds="8698" />

the fox's name though the Italian guy Yo Gotti the other one he was in the mob ratting out other people in the mob while he was murdering people yeah yeah the FBI allowed him to sell drugs and do a lot of he won the lottery twice

<timemark seconds="8717" />

while he was doing that so you know how that works out well and he would use that as a way to show income so he would pay them for their lottery ticket or steal it from him or whatever the hell you come get it and then I won the lottery and then he would win the lottery so that way he would have all this money laundered and avoid tax evasion charges that way then come get that but where'd you get that Cadillac where'd you get that house that's twice yeah he he was the FBI was helping him to obviously they were giving up competitors and they were responsible probably for some murdered yeah yeah they would bring people to him like that that was a thing like hey we're not going to kill anyone but will bring this guy to you so you can have a little chit chat and get on your driving the guy to it to his death

<timemark seconds="8777" />

yeah pretty much sums live in an apartment in Santa Monica with some girl just talk a lot and apparently she was yelling at them and that's that's how we got arrested them like they could domestic like some screaming and yelling and they were weird and that was what got people looking at them like who the fuck of these people and then they started me he wasn't even like hide in Montana or anyting on a ranch somewhere in the middle of nowhere with no one's going to be suspicious Santa Monica in an apartment that is fucked up crazy I don't understand like how it's got to be the most stressful life to lead just on the Run II watch that some of those shows like cold case files and when they find these people here and there is brutal prison hit on Whitey Bulger

<timemark seconds="8836" />

Jesus Christ yeah it's definitely got what he had coming to him and he's 89 made it to 89 looking over shoulder constantly while still in his wheelchair he was beaten to death with what in May call Shanks locks a lock in a sock got a weapon while in his wheelchair before possibly having his eyes powered partially gouged out with Shanks that's some real shit wow it works sometimes jailhouse Justice actually happens and you don't you don't you don't think it will but

<timemark seconds="8896" />

get what's coming to him how do we get on the subject that you establish your own sort of media company I love you decided to just start your own network but yeah but is it is it the other challenges like what we do is pretty simple because we just put it out there and we put ads on it right you know I'm down for you to put ads on it but is it is it challenging to like me and you you have a bunch of people like when I was there other folks were coming in and they had their shows in the studio is well and they said you change your green screen and I should change your convenient way to kind of instead of having a different set for every show it's a green screen and then we just pop it in a pop in the background and we can do some pretty funny things with it till we've done that I I did a reading last week of a part of my book and we went to an establishing shot of a cabin and I move to a chair behind the

<timemark seconds="8956" />

my screen is just me by a little fire burning in a hole hole welcome I didn't expect you a lot of challenges it's I I am not I am in front of the mic guy that's it I don't really like any of the other parts of the business visit it's weird this is the business I'm the guy Keith though is the guy of delegated a lot of the responsibility as to the tech end of everything and finding the people we need to run equipment and stuff over the course of the years and it's worked out very well but but it is one of those things like that it's two companies you have the entertainment that's going into the microphone and then all the shit you need to get that to the people and the business model and and you know billing and and all that shit that I can't fucking be bothered by a video games to play I can't

<timemark seconds="9016" />

bothered with that shit so you operate on it's a subscription T-Mobile pay by the month and you get a ton of shows they get the Mike Ward show yeah yeah yeah yeah I get Aaron and Gino doing in hot water is on Morning Show and they're just out of fucking control there the one show that I watch sometimes I feel like really wow that's I wouldn't do that yo yeah yeah they're brutally Comics yeah yeah they're comics in New York around really funny guys than so this is the this is the page with all show on it high tide pilfered Bill Schulz and Joanne nosuchinsky from Fox News they used to be on Fox News a red eye and stuff for real and East Side Dave is an insane motherfuker from the old Ron and Fez show what's in hot water and hot water is the morning show that Kevin Brennan who is just a mental patient Kevin scares me

<timemark seconds="9076" />

he yells a lot I come into the studio and I just hear his voice booming yelling and I get an anxiety attack like it's my dad yelling at mom back in the in the old days yeah it's just we were always looking for new shows you have on shows that fit I don't know how many is available anytime you want most of the shows go out live I like the element of just a little danger there of of being live as it goes out to I like that I don't know what it is but just knowing you could edit something might make you a little lazy as you're doing it then you can't stop your screaming at one point I'm at Mid fucked up we couldn't stream so we just added it and put it on filmed in advance rather and put it up later but it's like this feels feels weird it does it's because there's a net

<timemark seconds="9136" />

wet down there you could you could leave if you had to take a piss you could go I got to take a piss I got you know this is your going out like this is it there's a feeling that there's people listening right now right yeah and everything's archives so subscribers can get all the past shows from all the shows available can they download audio as well as video audio only two options we went with subscriber based because when I got the boots from serious years ago I couldn't imagine people want to meet us be Hawking their products in the in the first place and and I didn't want to be beholden to sponsors I can't have anyone telling me what I can and can't say anymore just ain't going to happen but is there an issue trying to get people like

<timemark seconds="9196" />

and who's on radio and they laughed and went to do a podcast Nana subscription podcast yeah and he what he was saying is it's really difficult to grow like you have to keep those people that you have to keep them happy and neither do things you can gauge with them and they would do like little events that go to a bar and meet everybody and do a show from there he said but it's really hard to grow because people don't want to pay when there's all these different shows they can just get for free yeah that's that's always a challenge but there's also the commodity that people can't get anywhere else is entertaining shows like you could have a free show that sucks and there's plenty of those out there but if you're good at what you do and and you already have an audience cuz I I say it all the time Corolla had the greatest line once he was being interviewed and someone said how do you how do you make a successful podcast goes off okay Rule Number 1 be famous and like yeah you got to

<timemark seconds="9256" />

so I figured if we get up and running in a month and keep the figure it out that we could hold onto a lot of the o&a audience that would come over and and and subscribe get a quick get up yeah and that's why I thank God I had that studio already built in my basement I was able to at all we needed was the logistics of a pumping it out onto the internet in a bigger number than I was doing at 3 in the morning you were doing some of them outside to yeah yeah we set up the camera out by the pool like my first guess was wiz dice which was hilarious ranji went downstairs in my basement that karaoke stayed and he was singing Elvis karaoke songs it was hilarious singing Elvis walk today it's like an awesome but yeah so so that model works for us and it's been working but I'm kind of seeing

<timemark seconds="9316" />

you got to keep on your toes and in especially a technology-based busy we were just going to let satellite radio like you don't you just can't tell what's going to happen you're really got to kind of look for future Trends and what not and maybe more of a hybrid thing because it's a balancing act of bringing new people in and like you said keeping the people that are there already but bringing new people in with some free content so maybe a tiered subscription thing where there is a free level with sponsors but then a tear a premium-level with the material that we've already had maybe past shows or something extra content but so we're we're always trying to think of what might be a good option when I first fire this thing up we have no fucking clue I mean this usually you would kind of do some kind of a research testing or whatever marketing analysis of day parts and shit like that and I just was like I could be here by 4 p.m.

<timemark seconds="9376" />

how long is it going to be 6 2 hours for 6 I could I can go out at 6 and I don't have to be there until 4 p.m. it's fucking easy still let's party Monday through Friday fuck that I want the 3-day weekend all the time for the rest of my life that I'm supposed to be in during the week so it just I wanted I didn't want to fucking be driving myself like that forever so the back of the hours the days and it worked so you know I'm very happy with that but again you. We're always assessing and see what we could do to kind of build it cuz it is that trade off of audience like obviously we're not going to get as many people watching on a subscriber base that we would if it was free with spots but you know what do you want to cut down on the paid subscribers and booze

<timemark seconds="9436" />

stop and then how far do I I go with advertisers where somebody can call them and fuck me over now and do I truly have free speech now or as free as I can be with a subscriber base so it's a balancing act I see what you're saying but you don't want to totally abandon the subscriber model cuz then you're at the mercy of subscribe of a average advertisers and it gets like we have appetizers now we have a couple of them that we thought maybe two spots on a show and I I do it they're all live reads so I make them fun and funny and you know it people like I learned that from Howard years ago when Howard would go to spots before it was indicated to it when he had all the time in the world sometimes you didn't even know he was still in a commercial break it was just funny so I try to keep it light and fun and adding things so it doesn't feel so intrusive but I don't live and die by sponsors it's not it's kind of supplements the subscriber's stuff so that works

<timemark seconds="9496" />

I don't know maybe I I'm paranoid because of my past that that sponsors might get pissed at what I'm saying but when I look at the shows especially the shows in the past year or so they're not as harsh as they were I was really fucking angry like 5 years ago when I started this whole thing I can't believe it's almost 5 years already. I've been doing this at compound media and I was just pissed and the show was a platform of like venting and and revenge and like I just I wanted to fucking yell and I'd be pissed about things that bang the desk about politics and society and and it came off as very angry and then as

<timemark seconds="9545" />

as time went on I realize like people were telling me god dude just be funny like just joke about shit and you have to be serious like I thought for some reason I don't do almost like a political show because of the fact that you've gone through so much shit he said yeah I was resentful I was pissed and and you know it's it's one of those things that really carried over onto the show but it in the past couple years I guess it's been especially with bringing Artie Lange on board for the eight months he was with me it's very difficult to get into any kind of commentary on society with Hardiplank sitting there how was that it was odd but it was great I mean you know the preface everyone gives his fucking love Arty hilariously funny so quick and and just a goofy Knockaround regular guy but the demons band the demons it was It was kind of rough to deal with like I said I'm a relax

<timemark seconds="9605" />

didn't show up one day I just feel myself didn't need to the show with Opie for a while no he was a guest on Oprah Show and and I guess I'll be approached him to be a co-host or something and he said no but yeah I was never part of the show me if he doesn't show up we're going out for a day every so often because I'll just do it myself but it turned out to be a little more than that there was some days that would really good and other days where it was a little frayed around the edges and you know he's done didn't he's got a different kind of demons yeah I like Beelzebub he's got like the main demons he really does man and it's so fucking sad to say cuz I mean there's no question about the talent there he's hilarious and a great guy always hear that

<timemark seconds="9665" />

we hire them it was I was at the Comedy Cellar and Dave Attell can I go saw your working with r t I like it yeah well welcome to the wonderful world of the three phone calls and not being able to find him like a fuck what do we get ourselves into and again I mean I had a great time he's one of the funniest motherfukers especially on a mic like that who would think that when Jackie Martling left the Stern Show they be able to replace him with somebody that was just funny as fuck that I have Legendary Shows with with arteon and you know he he definitely earned a place in in broadcast history but we just you know after 8 months it got a little too crazy to unpredictable and you need some predictability what was what was bad about it well it was the attendance issue was a little odd like a principal

<timemark seconds="9725" />

yeah yeah the attendance he was that he was tardy and and there were some days he was fucking just most days it was awesome but there was some days where you know their heads down it was kind of kind of a little iffy and regardless I know he knows that too I mean he's he's he lives in that body so you know he knows it's so it was a little off and then we picked up Dave Landau who's the young, cattle for Detroit he filled in a couple of times when we have guests on the show and then he filled in a couple of times during these few sabbaticals that he was away for a week or so and me and Dave just hit it off he's got a great sense of humor he's a little twisted he's got a great backstory the guy was just a fucking piece of shit for his stories about like drunk driving crash every car he had he was arrested 15 times before he was 18 like just a

<timemark seconds="9785" />

faster and you look at him now he's got a great wife a beautiful kid he's working comic and it is awesome he he knows how to co-host my shelf he gets it he we don't step on each other he knows exactly what to throw in and when so really happy with the with Dave Landau he's only did one show with him the last time I was in town when they were such fuck ups and fucked up cuz like you know you're almost want to go all right, but just drink one night I want to see what a disaster you are you know because you just don't know how it right. People didn't get but you never know he's the music music decent guy I love it I love that you're doing something different year and you

<timemark seconds="9845" />

basically you got put into a corner yes it alright I'm going to figure my way out of this it was a Lifeboat at first but it was really expanded it now and it's it's become a really interesting thing yeah and I never expected it I I gave it a lot of thought in between being fired and when we finally fired it up, media I was like what do I do I do I go fucking buy a ranch somewhere in the middle of the sticks and get guns and write a Manifesto or something I didn't know what to do no one was knocking on my door to fucking give me a job so when the idea came to do this it was pretty much all right I want to do this and regardless of how many Subs I can I get the overheads going to be barely anything it's me and my basement doing it broadcast so I wasn't really worried about the number of subscribers or anything like that and when we launched and it was really successful

<timemark seconds="9905" />

during the course of that year we started getting other shows Legion of skanks so the guys out there Big Jay oakerson and mess and I got the wrong thing on their own network but for a while they were doing their show from my house that was so weird it was like because you need their Legion of skanks with that they have their part of the show is that live audience so I have people coming into my backyard that I didn't know from hole in the wall that a driven out to Roslyn Long Island to sit on folding chairs in front of the guys and I'm walking around my basement like who are they spent like this is a little weird it's a little intrusive but it's cool but it and I don't really started getting fucked up just during the summer months they all jump in the pool so not this swimming at my pool on Legion of skanks

<timemark seconds="9965" />

so it wasn't that bad no one ever did anything bad they respected the house and everything which was very cool and then Gavin was doing the show we got Gavin on board from my house and a lot of times it was the night so I'd be upstairs on my couch watching TV or something he'd finish up come upstairs and sit on the couch and be like I just don't want to talk I talk all day I'm just I want to watch TV so it became a little weird and and after a year she was like let's get a place in the city it's easier for gas so we got a place at 35th and 7th right near Penn Station which works great and I take the train and out aren't the fucking driving to the city although that's another nightmare the transit Long Island Railroad but it just works out better that way it gets me out of the house it's a separation of personal life and and the other job so it works out I like to get a little sleep

<timemark seconds="10025" />

screaming at each other at the time today oh my God in my house and then we start doing some of the ice house and then I got a got a place got a the last one went to the show got bigger I just said let's get a big place I don't know how much you've shown the people on your show do you venture out and show him anything cuz it's it's insane it's a fucking airplane Hangar this is Giant and everything in every corner is cool that are at Mimi's archery game game it's amazing it it's compete against each other real Arrows with your compound bow into what

<timemark seconds="10085" />

Kevlar Kevlar screen the tips are flat like the top of a water bottle so I went to a gun range a couple of times on Long Island that also used a video on a screen that was made with the giant rolls of paper one horizontal one vertical and essential would read the light that would come through in a bullet hit and that would record where you shot and accurately showed up and then after too many holes got in all you have to do is wind the paper a little bit on each one and it it Miss a lines the holes so now I got a whole new sheet of paper to shoot at yeah and and it was very cold to be able to shoot at video Target so if you know the bad guy and yeah it looks like that good for real life situations for my amazing just looking at a bull's-eye like a typical Target face you're looking at the crease behind the shoulder

<timemark seconds="10145" />

are you trying to hit the Heart by the way you nailed that one I like the second one you did and it was a deer just a video of a deer standing there and it's moving its not a still picture and you drew that back and hit it exactly in the crease behind the leg that was a hard shot this fucking game is very addictive though you'll be out there pulling that bowl back you fuck your shoulder all day long it's to get super addictive I think about how addictive it is to play video games I think about competing against another bowhunter and you're talking shit to each other playing this game on the app for walking out in the field is really great practice for actual bowhunting yeah you can tell it it's very accurate to wherever that wherever that bolt it right on the money. This place is awesome you got to the same place I can even you you were that you know you took the ball and fucking ran with it man you really did this is amazing just Anime

<timemark seconds="10205" />

using a accomplishment like you're not you're the guy like like people like shit he's the guy that you're like ended up being the guy because of you guys because of being a gas on o&a and then watching crazy absolutely crazy I would go to B&H Photo in Manhattan I just buy shit and take it home hook it up and got bad at them quite work throw something in the closet get something else and slowly built up what I needed that work my goal was really to to have lower thirds and video over my shoulder and and look into the camera with a teleprompter so it looked like the news but it was done by a drunk guy who is singing good go off and just sing karaoke at horrible language like that to me was always funny like it was a parody of a real TV show I wanted to look

<timemark seconds="10265" />

good not just a Greenie camera with a Xbox headset I would literally just talking about this The Comedy Store the other night we were watching the news it was on the television and we're saying how much better with the news pay if you get a couple of ice and get fucked up and start smoking weed and then just put the real news like actual real stores in Ocean and just with Comics like I've actually I have to do that at The Comedy Store watching and talking a couple friends have actually thought about doing that like having a Nightly News or a Morning News show or just a show where one hour of the day is just like you get the AP bead yeah yeah all the newsfeed and you got video to go with it and you do stoned out or drunk new show we have a guy Michael malice that does kind of a daily wrap up show at 11 p.m. and it's hilarious cuz he'll put

<timemark seconds="10325" />

like the other day was talking about Tucker Carlson and the graphic comes up and it says Tucker Carlson but it's a picture of who the fuck was it Sean Hannity was a picture of Sean Hannity and rush it like that all the time and people like his wife I thought it was but he does that on purpose like he fucks with the graphics and the ticker at the bottom and everything and it's really it's really funny he's a he's a smart guy to go he's a clever little shit but that's election show during the presidential election couple of years ago then Gavin was on that one and we had all that the big American flag waving in the background on the green screen and everything and we were calling it like a sporting event depalo is there and it really turned into like a football game you're just got all my God we took out Florida it was so and it was we were all drinking and laugh and it was election coverage like the news Urdu

<timemark seconds="10385" />

we were just hammered and laughing my balls off so what do you think happens to Gavin now cuz I don't want bounces back from this. Kind of shit it's so dumb it's a different kind of shit that he's in right now cult leader like he's in this they've got it says that he's got the eye of Sauron on him once that's on you it's very hard to shake that fucking thing off of you yeah if anyone can do it it's Gavin he's been really reborn a couple of times like this thing not really they gave me a lot of yeah but that's like professional stuff that's not in this weird Showbiz Exile the place yeah well he's on what crtv it's still real to show their

<timemark seconds="10445" />

I see clips of him but yeah it's was that what is crtv kind of an internet thing tomorrow straight news kind of paste they have him on it he was on there he got hired by them maybe a year or so ago trying to do something straight he's not like these kind of the goofy I think the goofy aspect of it then I'll have you know the regular straight-laced guy he got a better offer to go over there anybody back it is weird though because you can be stricken from the record as they showed with Alex Jones they just holy fuck did they just get rid of him he is a non-person they fucking took every aspect of his a feed off of every bit of social media

<timemark seconds="10505" />

one company that also compete with another company that only ologist universally decided on their own independently yeah I can't stand the absolutist with free speech I A N N I know the fucking life to private company they can do what they want for you to speeches about the government and it's like yeah but are you okay with that are you okay with the faceless Corporation deciding what you can watch and see and hear and who can speak based on nothing but this arbitrary ideology that comes out of a building like I don't like that I want anyone to have the ability to speak about anything they want no matter how repugnant it is like like meat it with a lively debate well here's the here's a perfect example forget Alex Jones talk about we talked about earlier Laura Loomer versus Louis Farrakhan how that works how does that work okay for the guy on

<timemark seconds="10565" />

there to be calling Jewish people termites I mean that that is that something you exterminate yeah yes it's Nazi Germany type yeah exactly is that okay that's okay with you but then swimming about it's it's works that way on the left as well like how about that guy that just got kicked off of CNN right he was talking about the Jewish pounds really am house sitting and Liberation and not there like fuck you you're done like this this decision that or the thought processes involved in the decisions that they make is not based on rational thinking and objective know it's so arbitrary you just don't know it's based on which way the cultures swinging in a culture is is swinging in a way that avoids any any possible accusations of racism if you think in any way to avoid that because there's some people say Hall riffic shit about white people literally

<timemark seconds="10625" />

calling for their death and and it yet they don't got hired by New York Times and was a massive uproar because she had so many anti white things on her Twitter oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean just all that ridiculous left-wing woke nonsense now that you're allowed to be completely racist against white people massive generalizations against White Mountain particular yeah yeah it is it absolutely is discrimination and it's absolutely what what you're doing is you're being prejudiced but you're being Prejudice with a stamp so you going to stamp of approval your yeah you're allowed to be and I loved it but just rules that are made up that are ridiculous like you're a racist be this I've been making these fucking rules up and how come I am not privy to any of them of course I can't I can't call on any of these roles did the beautiful thing about that he will eventually bite them in their ass and

<timemark seconds="10685" />

people who are rational who listen to the argument against absolutely can be sexist against men salute a lot of feminists are one hundred percent sexist against men there's a minister of all her fucking Twitter picture the image the big one the banner one trust no man

<timemark seconds="10705" />

okay well good fucking luck good luck cutting out half the population don't trust them how about trust all women you going to do that congratulations cuz you got about 15 to 20% kant's and that's you going to have to trust all them 85 90% maybe good gas or polluted student population just like the population of men is a puta population women if you if you thought that you were going to get pure drinking water without dropping those purification tablets you going to get a charger or some shit in there yeah you got to get you going to get sick there yeah that there's no there's no 100% on any of that so when we saw the whole believe all women think that happened in the cabinet hearings and whatnot

<timemark seconds="10,761" />

it it's it's it's crazy like the idea that anyone would say believe all women is as mentally sane believe no women it's the same stupid thing because it's going to be assholes going to piece of shit I was saying on the show the other day like no one really wants equality no one equality isn't good beat the fight for equality is where it's at and you never want to attain it because then you're not special anymore if you're fighting for equality that you're always a victim there's always an oppressor and you you're fighting a monster equal you can be called a shithead you could be called stupid right now everything else you're just another face in the crowd with another stupid voice that probably shouldn't be hurt so no one ever really wants equality how much there clamoring was going to find some reason why it's not it's not valid and you can still say that you're being victimized by something is it currency

<timemark seconds="10,821" />

yeah yeah there is there's there's definitely equity and being a victim and not being equal yet to be prejudiced you can do a lot of things you could never do if you were another race yeah and now you see it is that I've been naughty guy that lawyer just hilarious he has the whole believe all women and then like a fucking movie script spins around and bites him right in the ass or he's like it happened so fast it's like if that would have been hilarious if it happened two years from now is just beyond hilarious Argento chick right yeah. The other one the one who is accusing Harvey Weinstein of raping her right and then turned out that she had me being it's basically what it what are they called

<timemark seconds="10,881" />

statutory rape I don't think it is I don't think you think it is either but the law is the law and the fact that it came out and that it came out that Bourdain it paid this kid off during the whole time they're all just believe all women in like we don't believe that one yeah yeah yeah probably shouldn't believe the fact that all that went down you know I mean it's just when these things play out like this it almost makes you wonder like God I don't I don't really believe we're living in a simulation but if we were living in something that's designed to almost it instills this lack of appreciation for reality yeah I seen it all seemed so bizarre and Ludacris and keep people keep like when when Anthony Weiner got in trouble for pulling his dick out I swear to God there was part of me that was going this doesn't eat

<timemark seconds="10,941" />

this is so so obvious it's so like right there yeah yeah so on the button yet it's not even subtle enough a lot of that stuff it seems like everything works out too much like it's scripted during Trump's campaign I kept saying he's got to win I go this doesn't play if he doesn't win trust isn't Rocky 1 this has to be Rocky II he's got a fucking win it's not about the battle in the bravery and it he's got to win this for this to work to really highlight the theater of the right he's got a spot lights in the theater of the absurd mean that guy again with the white around the eyes it all seems so fake everything is used to she says the way he looks like yeah everything is in sync I still every time I see him walking down the stairs are

<timemark seconds="11,001" />

just want I'm just like holy fuck Donald Trump is the president like what what kind of Wacky World of really wacky world Wacky World when he was giving that speech about Elvis and it's just like people tell me I look like Elvis that's what people have told me if I wasn't blonde I look like Elvis and and it's like no one told you that a little bit like Elvis and no one ever told you that maybe your belly right when it Elvis was sitting on the ball for the last time but that's about it how about when that reporter confronted him earlier the two of them together oh my God it's a little bit

<timemark seconds="11,052" />

how about the upper right hand corner what have you have you ever seen anyone trap anyone has any girls I love you too much baby. My son just a comb over it's like it's a wacky Contraption walking up the stairs of Air Force One with the winds blowing behind you see the whole back of his head is bald hair coming from it was like a fucking Vader's head without the helmet it kind of looked like that weird like what's going on you never know where it's starting and where it ends how long it is it's like it's like that oh my God that's just a picture that the video is more disturbing cuz you see the flaps yeah yeah chaos well how about you know where he didn't want to go out there for the

<timemark seconds="11,112" />

Fourth of July Memorial because he didn't want to get his hair or wet hair wet in the rain that has yeah that's what they was saying I don't know that is such a weird thing like he was a set of September 11th that's what was the president when 9/11 what is a Veteran Veteran's Day is a guy that's so like insecure yeah that is ever for decades yes to fucking do a a fucking Dairy Queen ice cream fucking move on his head everyday so he's fat like if you guys like if you really concerned so much about your looks why you fat I don't think he thinks he's fat I think it's like one of those guys that you talk about having the body dysmorphic body dysmorphia they just he looks in the mirror and sees Elvis like young leather-clad Elvis size cuz he feels like the body is like a battery and

<timemark seconds="11,171" />

if you put any energy and it's going to try it out where is it out while the mother fucker is up at all hours during the campaign for the midterms he was doing 3 rally today flying all over the country and he never seem to be like he was falling asleep or losing energy so I don't know what he's doing well do you know about all that he says I get exercise I mean I walk by this I that Trump said he wants to do in the Oval Office I run over to a building next door I get more exercise than people think

<timemark seconds="11,203" />

I run over to it feels amazing my exercise is incredible allegedly according to one reporters on diet pills and he's been on diet pills for ever and then there's a prescription that they let mean he he actually even cited the exact Duane Reade Pharmacy where he was supposed to take this for like a little while we want to taking it for years so you can some form of amphetamines good for him in this day and age you would be fucking stunned if you found out how many journalists how many people were writers how many people that are professionals how many people at work or on adderal oh yeah yeah I mean I live in an area where there's a lot of people that have money and they work real hard and because the fact they need energy I know a shitload of people to take a nap yeah folks that are in Hollywood folks that are in finance all sorts of different yeah I know quite a few also the other day it's everywhere man it is such a you know the difference

<timemark seconds="11,263" />

between methamphetamine and amphetamines the difference between meth and what you're getting when you get out of all is so God damn close so close now you take that you're thinking you're a mess head the only difference is how quick it hits you literally only difference then the dosage that you got is obviously regulated if you get it at all right right I don't know I am not a I'm not a pill guy never have been what you got here Jamie we pulling up it says here about being on a treadmill allow awesome for the first time actually quite a while and it was a very steep angle and I was there for a very long time he said they were surprised and they said well you can stop now that's amazing and I said I can go much longer than this if you want me to pay Trump right now buddy I got a challenge how about you join the silver October fitness challenge and I will put that strap on you will see what's up see you see who's amazed

<timemark seconds="11,323" />

email Jeanne everything is over the top with trumpets successfully before have been more of a believer in diet cuz I'm strong you know I've always been more of a believer in diet cuz I'm strong you know I hit the ball far I mean I'm strong physically he said that is so hilarious will umagine wrestling him how we keep feeling like I just a bag of Jell-O just grab ahold of anybody and smush it's all good she barely held together by a thread and I can let you talk about your strongest weapon I'm strung mean when he said that he would beat up Joe Barden that was my that was like to hear Joe Biden we go down fast and hard that's what he said due to the fact that they're talking like that again absurd it's so fucking funny that boat and buying it said the same thing

<timemark seconds="11,383" />

when did The Truman and Dewey trade barbs like that back in the day is what is he saying Nixon and Kennedy

<timemark seconds="11,394" />

they asked me what I like to debate this gentleman I should know I said if we were in high school and take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of them

<timemark seconds="11,402" />

meanwhile I don't believe that I think Trump will kick his ass I really do and I think by mistake yet Trump at better be able to he would swing and he would slip and fall in a fuck is Nia and Trump would kick him in the face like a soccer ball he would get lucky and he would walk away and find would be holding his teeth and blood coming out of his mouth he like I told you in the best of the best ever I need to get away with it yes I can gets away with a lot of things and there'll be a lot of people that want to kick Trump's ass and get back in a bit would never manifest if they would never come to play psycho where people thought Stormy Daniels going to take him down then it turns out Stormy Daniels beat some chick up on a torn satin and now she's after Ivan ADI also because he apparently isn't giving her an accounting of where all the money that she raised online was going to and he apparently filed she said he filed that lawsuit against Trump against her wishes she didn't want it done

<timemark seconds="11,462" />

now she she's not getting an account to get the money it's hilarious that she lost and now she has to pay his do you want to run for president another job me in the mix another dummy listen to a building it's the same thing it's the sample and I actually talked to you guys in Hollywood it works in Hollywood as I got high-level guy he's got a respectable job he's like we need a guy like that like that have an odd guy on our side of doesn't talk any shit why doesn't take any shit a guy who could talk about on his bullshit I'm like what are you talking about man what are you talking about this guy this lawyer this guy the guy you think you need running the country are you serious it's a disaster they wanted to believe that he was a guy right fit the narrative

<timemark seconds="11,522" />

I love you fat fuck you fucking liar you piece of shit Trump trump has nothing to lose it is what it is like Trump could say anything and he does because where they were they going to do one of two things about diet pills they were there putting about in feta means no reading down in this article all of the side effects about it and it's like Smosh John's elevated sense of your place in the world a collie is the president of the president thinks he has but yes he's he's fucking number 1 through 10 your number one yeah yeah who's going to lie maybe that is one of my favorite Hillary

<timemark seconds="11,582" />

at least she was she said I would like to be president that's what she said oh yeah be president right right to be president like to like a cookie that's what it comes off as if you kiss my ass I would like to suck my toes what would you would like it Trump would like it that's why Trump comes off as like a just a bad stand up when he does those rallies and everything like you can tell when he's squinting at the the prompter is like We As Americans most Bubba Bubba and then you see his eyes open he's like so let me tell you about any and that's when I go oh here it comes here comes and when he when he talks about ice things like the men and women advice just amazing people a job that none of us want to do we don't want to do and then he starts the crowd work this guy over here

<timemark seconds="11,642" />

like what president it's so fucking bizarre 90 minutes speech that he gave this rambling nonsense of people this is the day the presidency unraveled those two years ago that shit was forever ago so I don't know if he's still unraveling it's it's it's just who he is to the you know this guy the whole life and what we need to do cuz guaranteed in 2020 that's going to be the pitch against Trump we need to return to some semblance of sorry I was going to be a young Democratic Socialist type character that says a lot of things the young people want to hear right and then it's like a completely anti-racist anti-homophobic trans rights all right that's what I think and there's someone who can hold it together and someone doesn't have a good fucking Beelzebub in the closet

<timemark seconds="11,702" />

there is some shit just fucking graveyards falling out of people's closets it's the people that want to be in power that all have these fucking skeleton yeah yeah I know that's what the weird things I want to be in power yeah I think it's hilarious like you look at the politician like you just described at a rally or a speech and behind them it's just it's so well choreographed like everyday nationality is represented and you know you just see it looks like something out of a fucking Star Trek episode that hats from different lands and all kinds of things like that to me is just as fake and and potentially like offencive as just the Trump background white trash is like Laura Dern running Star Trek or star Star Wars that's what it's like it's just it's like but then that roll and I mean

<timemark seconds="11,762" />

when she's like telling the pilot to shut up I don't listen stock has a fucking straight up killer got there flying up my pilot if he's piling a spaceship and coming down evil robots I want to blow up the planet yeah he's really going to be imitated by Laura Dern remember when we first started running this m Punk shop shut the fuk up Jesus for his bad just force fed yeah really obvious theatrical plays at diversity and inclusiveness tell that they like they pushed everybody there's no authenticity to their their message say all the right notes and make all the right sounds it's yeah yeah they're complying it's a compliance thing right much as it is an expression of who they are as individuals and I have to be compliant with this new this new

<timemark seconds="11,822" />

hey people are thinking and behaving but it's so ham-handed like like it's really over the top it's obvious it's like a guy named weiner pain his dick out of my head you know what I got heard that some of the movies that are coming out I think they're doing a girl version of Bad Boys which is like why the fuk just like Ghostbusters which was such a success and then I saw this there so I read this the other day there's a Broadway show of of King Kong is an hour Broadway musical and they have this amazing kind of marionette gorilla on the stage giant fucking thing and the girl that plays a and arrow and and now a new girl has been cast She's black

<timemark seconds="11,882" />

no I'm like this the whole gist of King Kong is the fact that it's a white brought all island is full of black chicks marionette King Kong picture at what what's up with his face I don't know they had to make him get out almost you know how the characters look in The Lion King the musical something weird yeah that's all I'm a marionette yeah it's like a fucking it's on cables and and shit has people working it and how strange it if there's a video clip of it and you see it kind of move its it is strange that guy we got to see a video but like I said the whole fucking thing is based on its the white chick like like it it's part of the store you can I can understand you can cast a black actress in White actress part of the story that this fucking got you sick that's amazing yeah it looks pretty

<timemark seconds="11,941" />

we just got to get out of there buddy this is amazing Broadway stage they got all this amazingly got the teeth lit up and everything we have a lighting is pretty important going to get a black Trans man has been on this island with black chicks and he sees her and just loses his fucking Monday night it's so goddamn funny videos true it's like that movie is like the most racist movie of all time

<timemark seconds="11,987" />

it's okay I went when the Remake came out I think it was Peter Jackson remake came out Patrice went off on it and did a whole thing about what the movie represents and what the chick and the gorilla represent in Earth and it was fucking brilliant only as Patrice could have done it any the movie Frozen the little kids movie I never saw a girl who can fucking turning things in the ice skating thing there's a Disney version of live Disney version that they've decided to end in the live Disney version there's the girl is now play by a black girl haha but it's it's a blonde girl who lives in like Norway excited to have her be played by a black on people went crazy it they said all these emails in like this is outrageous like what are you doing it's like yeah but I feel like these companies they it's

<timemark seconds="12,048" />

there's too many people involved right it's not like compound media is just Anthony cumia making decisions right right with something like Disney you have this board and you probably an in California you have to have a certain Women On the Border imagine what that must feel like you have to have equal representation of everyone and everyone's super concerned about diversity like that a Friday is a pitch the show and when they walked in there the first question they said he pitched the show they go okay where's the diversity diversity like who's pitching the sitcom I'm spitting you something funny I picked you a funny program yeah yeah okay we need we need an Asian man black woman we needed this and that went again like we were talking about it's so obvious that it becomes distracting like I don't want I don't want to have to watch something that that diversity is just forced in there because you notice it and now you're distracted

<timemark seconds="12,107" />

can you can't really enjoy the day like that can contact like how do they do the part where they at the the natives on Skull Island Kong is just like I get out of here but this one is something different and it's definitely the hair color and the skin tights just what it was regardless of how horrible it is or whatever has to move on I guess I'm a old man old white dude dude doesn't like when a black woman gets her role for all black women or white women there is so many instances where that's fine and no one would notice and whatever I don't even I don't have a problem with the Hamilton or whatever they want to cast Founding Fathers as Black and Hispanic dudes what apps go at it but like when it's an integral part of the story it's most of the story that's reason stupid reason really loses his mind right

<timemark seconds="12,167" />

the whole time he's he's on camera in the movie it he's there losing his mind because of the white chick

<timemark seconds="12,179" />

yeah just don't make a movie don't make the movie or don't make the play a black woman of color favorite criticisms is how dare to white people have this discussion without a person of color in my room and go fuck themselves who who was the Preposterous idea the idea that hold on Anthony before we go any further let's bring it a person of color yeah yeah we are privileged people we should be discussing is that is true even communicate about something you can't all we hear about is how we need an open and honest discussion about race and then the second you try to have one shut up don't talk about that everybody keeps ignoring you want to know what's racist Harvard tries really hard to keep Asian people out yeah. Making it way more difficult because Asian p

<timemark seconds="12,239" />

are far better at school than white people that's the way it is and they have to balance that they it would be full of Asians look so what if everybody was accepted for qualifications that would be Asian horror but it is amazing the people that are rallying against racial discrimination don't look at that because that is absolute racial discrimination but on the other end of the spectrum right right you're taking these people that are there are minority there a small percentage of the population and they vastly outperformed most of the groups has made it more difficult for them to get in and now there's a giant class action lawsuit against one of the most liberal and Progressive Institutes of Higher Learning ever it is racist they're fucking undeniably racist that is up yeah it's very against the superior people it's absolutely based on nothing but someone's race at that background and they're they're doing it yeah well they're doing it for now

<timemark seconds="12,299" />

pronounce but you don't hear about this from the social justice Warriors and race baiters they want to go out about white privilege and you know yeah it it really is but look I just like bringing shit up that I notice and if I noticed that there squeezing diversity into something that doesn't need it I think it looks it still like I said distracting and it's out of place and then other things like the other day I noticed the I-90 probably shouldn't even say it that the Mars probe that just landed on Mars and they show the control room at jet propulsion Laboratories and they're all as plotting could possibly be the least diverse room I've ever seen in my life a bunch of white nerds that's all it was there were a couple of like big women like like kind of ghetto lesbians lesbians but for the most part it was every nerdy guy grown up and Landing a fucking spec

<timemark seconds="12,359" />

the billion miles away on fucking Mart it's it's insane because when push comes to shove you need the people that can get the job done and if it's that room a people it's that room a people you can't artificially Diversified something just for the optic and get the job done they had everyone in that room had a reason to be there and I assume it's based on qualifications but if you noticed that or mention it. I'm sure I'll be called a fucking braces for that but for sure don't ever notice things you don't notice Trends don't notice things feel like that's going away though I don't see it but I just feel like it's a bright way of nonsense that's hitting us and it's going to balance back out and rational thinking is can you hear something like this is what I think that drives me crazy it's like you know address your white privilege recognize your wife

<timemark seconds="12,419" />

no you know why I'm not racist okay so if I'm not racist you should be concentrating on racism you should be concentrating on people who don't experience racism because they're fortunately white cuz I didn't do anything you're doing is putting you in a position where you're always guilty and once they put you in that box they always can shut you up because they're the logic is not very good so the discourse is not it's not well thought-out it's not really nuanced so because of that they want to be able to just push a button and shut you off right that button is the white privilege button but that's you're looking at a you're looking at a reality yeah do white people have it easier than people who get racially discriminated against yes sure the promise not to white people that have it easy the problem is the people that racially discriminated so you're finding somebody want to make them a bad person just by being

<timemark seconds="12,471" />

how did the thing that you've decided is the oppressor yeah it's a racist thing everything is the same level it whether you have an opinion about something just voicing an opinion about something that involves race or sexuality or whatever it is and literally calling for violence against people that it's all in the same category when it's ridiculous your your personal opinion on anything that that is sensitive these days like I said race or sexuality or what-have-you it doesn't mean anything unless you use some kind of negativity or depression or something against the person because of your opinion until you do that you just have a fucking opinion and and it's not all that dangerous Patricia's to say that to me cuz I never met a racist in my life cuz I never met one never sat down and had someone calling the n-word or anything like that it goes to heaven that one he's been

<timemark seconds="12,531" />

fun places to take him some places but you have somebody that has a low opinion of a black people and you're going to a bar to sit down is a black dude sitting there and watching the Yankee game or something and go up he goes or is he going to go yeah I guess so like like there's there's levels of that he might have an idea about it but until you start exercising that I don't honestly don't see a problem with this piece of wood and they have discriminative discriminatory ideas about all sorts of things it just when you allow some but don't allow others when you allow discrimination against white people but you don't allow against black people create resentment when you allow discrimination against men but don't allow against women because you feel like women have been victimized so it's our time

<timemark seconds="12,591" />

our turn will know it doesn't work that way doesn't work that way especially when you talk to people that aren't rapist okay so you think everybody fucking crazy and then they start changing what rape is right yeah well that's what they say that's kind of what they've done I mean obviously the like the Louie CK situation I know that is so people are so divided on that one and my opinion is if if he didn't do anything make anyone do anything against their will he's just a guy that has a strange proclivity you know he likes jerking off in front of people apparently the cats out of the bag there but like those girls that upset 20 years ago with a that upset 20 years ago that that now it's an issue or with a giggling with a lot like I need to know how they were then cuz I don't give a fuck what you think now like at the time what was it okay was it

<timemark seconds="12,651" />

cool with you did you sit there and fucking rib elbow to the ribs with your girlfriend go look at the sky jerking off in front of it to me I don't care what what time is done because they beat the way something looks the morality or ethics or respect that is expected in 2018 ain't what it was 20 years ago something you did 20 years ago when it was normal or a little strange whatever the fuck it was weird that's an odd thing to do right and this is something that I brought brought up to be bugging you know when people say you don't he would lock these women on room and beat off tomorrow. If you going to like push this year you're saying that because that fits urinary he's this abusive person who's abusing his power and here's another problem with that when this is all going down he wasn't very famous no that's just it too so what power was he abusing he was a successful

<timemark seconds="12,711" />

median he was admired by his peers cuz he was really funny yeah he wasn't Louie CK like the Superstar filling out Madison Square Garden Louie CK if it wasn't the same guy called HBO specials and all the Netflix specials would like to beat off in front of people and he would ask first so I can you say that he you know Force these women and wouldn't let them leave I don't say that in fact he asked and when they said no he didn't do it he didn't say oh well good you don't want me to be. That would make it feel even better when I beat off in front of you shut the fuck up and sit down wasn't doing no no he was asking which is which is so strange it's not it's it's not in the same realm as as Harvey Weinstein's no it's not even close I'm close but people don't want you to rationalize I don't want you to grade things they just want to talk about abuse all of you

<timemark seconds="12,771" />

it's shoveled into this one little pie chart area like this is male abusers now and then they'll put Matt Lauer right next to Bill Cosby right next to Louie CK like well this seems kind of crazy and then when you say it's crazy like Matt Damon said was I think we should make a distinction day by day oh yeah rape apologist and you say things like that and it it's weird cuz it's on cuz even saying the word rape these days like a little red flag goes off and it had like how do I say that did I say hurtful did I say it evil and it was it when you sound evil or did the salivating. Right don't be salivating go to smile when you say it's very somber sissy I use the term all the time because it's the only one that really fits orwellian everything is so strange. It if you read 1984 years ago you couldn't fat

<timemark seconds="12,831" />

some things getting like that but man in some cases it's even worse than than expected you think there aren't on on person you don't think there's a nun Alex Jones on person wipe them clean from the fucking that that's it the new speak words are twisted like it means the opposite of what it was supposed to mean and and it it's something that you never thought would happen why I was so it like you read a book like that or some other kind of dystopian dystopian story you get like a like an orb is supposed to be some kind of orbs with a government looking at you and ya don't do that sir 26530 to sit down and then us where the rats we we pick up our phone and we're at each other out and we're big brother like we turned out to be the bad guys the collective

<timemark seconds="12,891" />

is that the government takes like like like oh boy you're going to look up Miss can I put a tracking device on you that it comes to my house and shoot him I don't care you forgot your phone don't leave your house without your fucking tracking device like it's the same thing and they do use those and crime case everything is presented as a convenience when I first got EZ Pass it was like this is awesome I don't have to wait on a line at toll booth and throat change in or something I'm wheezing right through and I see a story it's like so easy pass use in a divorce case to see what the husband was going here and there is and it's like oh that's handy that's how you see on the insurance commercials it's like use the safe driver thing it goes in your car that acts like a a plane's black box and and it shows how to save you driving though reduce your rates like really it's not going to be used if I'm speeding again and wax in it for them to go yet we're not paying your fucking thing because obviously would read that you were speeding and and and didn't stop or like it's all

<timemark seconds="12,951" />

presented as a convenience Alexa you literally your TV's they all rap you out this magic thing that everything happens internally that she sends everything you say out recorded somewhere and it sends whatever answer it supposed to give back back to it and that's what it is but everything is is saved and do you really know when it's listening and what when you're tough you say certain things I had Alexa for a little while I don't know why all I ever did was like Alexa weather no tell me the weather I could have checked on my phone and then it started doing things like I just be watching TV and it would be like I don't have an answer for that like I don't need that shit I don't know what it's doing I don't know what it's listening dialogue from the television from ABC to TV maybe it's just listening to every fucking thing I say I think I'm sending it from the church somewhere you ever asked it is listed there in

<timemark seconds="13,011" />

text fucking form swear you every conversation of it that God damn thing is somewhere on cloud bad what do you work today or you go well I hate to say right right you just say about how about yeah if you're not doing anything bad well in 10 years will it be bad in 5 years just like shit that was 20 years ago wasn't bad now it's a fucking crime you'll be exiled from society I don't know what if what I'm saying now can be brought up in 10 years and you know what I play video game I see some pretty nasty shit report my Smart TV listen to every fucking thing I say and record transcripts of what I'm talking about and we bring it in our house no one's forcing you to put this fucking paid for it you spend the money and you put it there and plugged it in yourself it's amazing how we went from not trusting anything

<timemark seconds="13,071" />

when it online shopping for started me like I'm not put my credit card in there now you'll laugh the way you kidding you just drove through 20 face scanners license plate scanners to get here yeah you can get your card is being picked up by a sensor so they can Target advertise you in the mall so please no privacy anymore and we love it we love that there's no privacy I don't want to go to the ball for Christmas go to Amazon and that is a list of every fucking thing I buy at Amazon it's being sent to everyone all over the place you think you got privacy fuck you you can't even move to Montana anymore in a cabin and be off the grid but just doesn't happen so I left Jesse The Body Arc Jessie when it does I'm off the grid I'm going to Mexico and I'm off the grid that's like he's got a show called off the grid

<timemark seconds="13,131" />

Governor's yeah he's off the grid but he's constantly on-the-go Off the Grid anymore there's no things for the Internet available everywhere all over the world and I was talking about the others with somebody else isn't it amazing that GPS has worked for as long as it has flawlessly it's amazing how good it was never a problem inch by inch like literally tells you turn right and you're right there and I think we have the dumb down version like the military has that the premium version like Usher and we have you know by a couple of feet but to me it's amazing that like it it's work this long how do you say hi in my car in 1998

<timemark seconds="13,191" />

Island yeah I had the early version of that and it was a big stupid thing that had a sit on top of the roof of my car to catch the catch the satellite in like I was some weird antenna that had to go up there that I used to have to have to to pick up the the GPS satellites are in any different but the receivers are like can be a lot smaller and fucking phone and your fucking shit balls in your pocket the tracking you while it's in your pocket in your car as you're driving course when it's off when it's I don't trust any of these electronic I use them if I do forget it there's no more horrifying feeling then driving away from your house and got everything to people again if if there was that EMP or whatever the fuck it is that just zaps the the grid you would see pandemonium

<timemark seconds="13,251" />

no time well you would see pandemonium of just the power grid went down for any reason if some terrorist attack took out the power grid yeah we need power way more than we think we do just think nothing of we are in New York we had the hurricane a few years ago like 5 or 6 years ago I guess it was and the one that took out jersey and Long Island and stuff and we went 9 days without power in in the house in in on Long Island and you could see it fraying around the edges man society just the first couple of days you'd be on online at the gas station to fill up Jerry cans to take back to your generators at the house and it's like all 7th 8th day it got fuck you know I was standing here go fuck yourself get to the back of the line now could you imagine if that was

<timemark seconds="13,307" />

you trying to get your kids medication or something or food like it just goes a little longer and now Foods getting a little scared you are going to have a problem and I'm stunned it hasn't happened to any extent really we saw we saw it close with Katrina I think and violence started that was that was a little out of hand but use app that gray give people to have nothing I want to get a giant fucking like a Cummings generator this thing like is for backup power hospitals so when the power goes out in my neighborhood literally my pool is running flood lights in the backyard every TVs on it comes on automatically just sit there it's liquid propane to 1000 gallon tanks buried in my front yard so it would it would it would last for a long fucking time

<timemark seconds="13,367" />

the more drawn it the heart of the engines got to work so it depends if I'm running my whole house it would last a few weeks and it's safe to that propane to be in those cans oh yeah underground not there in giant they're running natural gas into my neighborhood so I might have a converted over to natural gas but I like the fact that if the gas brakes to I can still at least Jacka an LP truck somewhere and fill up my own tank you know if push came to shove but it is just every light in the house can be on my neighborhood is dark or just looking at it like suckers yeah yeah I've got a few times I'm waiting for a big one though like I really want a big bad black guy with the fridge with guns coming

<timemark seconds="13,419" />

like it really it ain't there is something a little creeped you out the the prospect that we are really delicately balanced as a society it could really fly a part we trust too much that the powers just to be on that the water's going to run that the food is going to be at the supermarket or whatever the fuck it is like you got a great Advantage being able to hunt you don't like people don't do you know what American refugees would look like the fat fucking mess Crossing some border to Canada to be saved from some cataclysm that happened down here what a bunch of fucking just weeks off no nothing every convenience they've used for years just not trained in in the feeding yourself outside in the wild have no idea your skin an animal ever kill something to eat do you know how to get water from just the humidity in the air or there are things that we just don't know because we depend on technology

<timemark seconds="13,479" />

and we trust that is always going to be there cuz it has been I mean you know we get very complacent but that's why if it ever failed ho fuck you better hunker down some praise and deed and on that note do we just did like 4 hours it seems like it flew right by it did floor that is nuts I got it thank you man I love you on your show you're the reason why this all happened it's crazy how people know it's fucking nuts I I love it I love it I got a book out permanently suspended available anywhere go to compound media.com for all the details alright bye
