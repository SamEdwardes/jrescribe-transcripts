<timemark seconds="394" />

 The Joe Rogan Experience

<timemark seconds="398" />

 so what hundred mile man or hundred man what is it the 100-mile man is that years ago and that's cool that you got it because that's a very popular thing now did you run this before or after you did the book with David Goggins I ran it before time and I did it there like 400 Americans that are ran a hundred miles or something how many people do it now I was trying to figure out in my head how many do the year and like how many races hundred mile race is there are there a month and then multiply it out sup pipe five or six thousand I'm guessing I think probably I think Americans

<timemark seconds="454" />

 it's a long way it's a long fucking way just about talking right before the podcast about how I Miss America yanked off all of this did no longer judge by their beauty and I post this cuz I thought it was silly and there's just these fights online man's fucking fights in the comments and fights and people are tent people need to go out run those hundred miles react they loosen up fast fast I don't know what the fuck is going to Miss America scrapping the swimsuit competition would no longer be judged on physical appearance it's literally a beauty contest that is what it is what are they replacing it with

<timemark seconds="497" />

 I mean I got to think it's like when Playboy decided to not have people nude right that like and the but they here's the thing but no longer judging them on their physical appearance or what does that mean what does that mean you that we were no longer a pageant Gretchen Carlson says

<timemark seconds="517" />

 where competition okay

<timemark seconds="522" />

 I give up I don't know I think this might be a bit you know hurt the ratings a little bit in a little bit maybe people will get very excited to talk yeah maybe people will be pissed off until TuneIn it's just I don't know where do you stand on it I can fuck is so stupid, this is what's really fast it was a reading the comments a lot of feminists were angry at me that I was mocking saw a few of them I don't get it like why would you even want a who I most like the fuck contest cuz that's what it is I mean that's really what it is you have any gals parade around their bikini it's a beauty contest do we have a mr. America contest like was that just the president is that what the first American contest I don't know someone who's connected to competition and mindsets yeah I don't know

<timemark seconds="583" />

 I want that closely but I am going to miss that part of the competition to be honest with you so many opportunities like you know I'm doing a lot of options back then maybe the just see their faces and just have to assume they're in their swimsuit you know it'll be like a bubble thought bubble going to be filled with an amazing quote they say not to be the new swimsuit issue cuz we're just judging them on their minds right and the content

<timemark seconds="626" />

 speaking content living with monks yet what is it called living with the monks living with them Uggs this your new book yes why should I do that and how long do it for I did it for 15 days I was off that's more than enough man

<timemark seconds="644" />

 yeah where do I go like this for an hour your fingernail fall off and I would do it with your finger up and down list of repetition what did you have to do is why I live with their work they were 8 months for what you've been there for 50 years 50-50 on a monastery 800 800 500 Acres kind of in the middle of nowhere and I want for 15 days so I figured you know I had invested so much in my life on the physical side and ran 100 miles and just always active and this and that and have really invested very little on my own in her work and I just felt like man I just felt overwhelmed a little bit and I said to my wife you know who the Masters and everything pointed to Monk's and I said I want to go live on a monastery there's something romantic about that right it's almost like the guy who goes off into the woods to write a book like being with a with a monk like and just being let you know in a monastery with monks to something very romantic about that

<timemark seconds="705" />

 is that you've said all your worldly belongings and you no longer care about the day-to-day nonsense that everybody is fixated on just decide to just yes all day I don't want I don't want to do it the opposite of a monk's life of my life is filled with bullshit I get it yeah I went to a monastery just south of Canada in the states yeah but no state is it it was in Upstate New York on the Vermont border and it was you no no phone total kind of separation from my family at four kids my wife and just got to get to know myself a little bit now when you were up there was there any time with you like what the fuck by doing like 1 minute into it

<timemark seconds="763" />

 I got when I first got up there the main monk like my go-to monk brother brother Christopher took me to my room they call the rooms that sell which is about the size of the stable and I had to bed I walked in there was a bed there was a little desk with a night lamp on it and nothing on the walls and he said tomorrow we're going to start prayer reflection and meditation at 7:15 a.m. and I looked at my watch and it was 6 p.m. and I asked him what do we do between now and 7:15 a.m. and he looked at me dead in the eye and he said you think

<timemark seconds="801" />

 and I said to myself I'm fucked because

<timemark seconds="807" />

 I don't really like spending a lot of time and thought so I went and I said okay I'm going to I'm going to meditate you know like I'm here let me start this journey with meditation I taking a little of course and trans Dental meditation I'm not a big meditation guy other than running and so I set my timer for 20 minutes and I sat down in my chair and I started like focusing on my mind run like immediately on bombarded with how is my wife how the kids hardly all the Hawks Atlanta Hawks everything's coming at me and you know what time is going by and I'm just getting bombarded with thought and I'm like why is my timer buzzes like it's been I've been here forever so I was going to look and reset my thing I like that would be cheating let me keep going and I'm going all the time is going by the filing like fuck is going on with my time are you know so I open my eyes and I Look to reset my timer 3 minutes and 27 seconds

<timemark seconds="867" />

 other was like ours man I mean like I never really sat in a room like with nothing going on and just close my eyes alone and thought and time to stop and I calculated how much time I have left like 15 days x 24 hours and 60 minutes and I said to myself I meant I'm in trouble this isn't like like this isn't what I'm on Gilligan's Island is a real like I can't get out of here and I had a really hard time with it was the commitment the commitment was 15 days so the only person up to you like there's no getting nothing in writing and did you have a way to escape I was thinking of escape plans but

<timemark seconds="915" />

 on the monastery misses little crazy that the way the monks keep the lights on is they breed German Shepherds that's how they make money they breed German Shepherd of the largest yeah they wrote a book I have the book it's book about raising puppies her at the same time same guys German Shepherds so they live on this property any of these 11 German Shepherds and at the end of the property the only way off the property where two mobile homes on connected to the monastery at the end of this road that leads up to the monastery and both of those homes had German Shepherds as well that was a little territorial so there really was no way for me to escape like I come up and down the driveway while I was there because I couldn't leave

<timemark seconds="966" />

 the property so you just time to yourself or paste yourself with these a nap or something I said like 2,000 steps equals a mile you know I counted at Market what are they saying about you running back and forth like that thought I was fucking psychopath you guys have been here for 50 years then I'm trying to get the guys like that have been there for 50 years quiet now they weren't they were extremely listen to date they were doing what they wanted to do with their life so they were super happy yes super present I mean very present and I live in a world that to-do list man and let you know they were very present very happy and really really nice to me and everybody who did you talk to them this week English what was that conversation like like what it what it what do you say to a guy's been in a monster

<timemark seconds="1027" />

 50 years staring at the Walls by want it if I could have talked to him about the pageant that was just the background. So let me know how does a private jet business they didn't understand private jets really and then I said I had a coconut water company they never heard of coconut water I told him I was involved with the Atlanta Hawks and one of the monk said I've been to a an expose game and I'm like that's a different sport and they don't play they don't exist anymore this is very like time-warped at first it was really interesting really interesting know what led these get these guys that are 50 years 50 years on the monitor how old were they so some of the age range from I think the youngest monk was probably 35 up until late seventies so late seventies with the guys that have been there for 50 ass yeah

<timemark seconds="1085" />

 yeah young 20s in the same spot they actually built this Monastery by hand they bought 500 acres for very thin I think it was like $50,000 I'm going to be crazy and then they built the monastery by hand and so it's been a passion of love and labor and and they've been there since and so the valves held to see the whole deal celibacy poverty at 20 valve for things of

<timemark seconds="1118" />

 celibacy poverty's they pledged all their personal belongings to the monastery so really the only possession is a driver's license obedience and stability meaning we're not leaving this is what we need so let me talk about discipline just hard to do forever forever they are self-sufficient so they stay free German Shepherds they selling running kind of one income stream and in their masters World Masters of dog training training so every two weeks they have 10 dogs that come in and they and I watch this I mean it literally dogs come in like Spuds MacKenzie and we'll leave like they just left at it's cool I can send it it was anytime you're in the presence of

<timemark seconds="1167" />

 the people that are the best in the world what they do it's fucking fascinating and these guys were Masters they are the masters of there's a lot of people that are great but in their space of dog training and breeding what was so special about the way they train dogs just the command like they had an energy that the dogs responded to I'm not I would walk into multiple crazy they sniff my nuts did Johnny like they go nuts these guys walk in and like they could just sense that they were in control and like the eye contact that they do everything the way that they talked at tone their hand mannerisms they just have mastered this and they have a deep connection with dogs dogs are weird and a one year old golden retriever and he has different rules for different people and he knows he can get away with what with my wife's mom has zero shot at controlling this dog

<timemark seconds="1228" />

 right he's like no no no I'm the boss what is this you don't do this and doesn't matter when she's here he just decides new set of rules with this lady for in the beginning when I first got them and when Ryan the trainer comes over he just likes it. He's super chill he listens he's like to do to control me it's it's very interesting he's even different with me than he is with my friends like my friends are come over so I thought I'd try you at motherfucker you would be like across the board with everybody but he just it's all love so it's not bad you know he's just a lucky dog yeah and I'm not really a dog

<timemark seconds="1288" />

 I like dogs but no but we don't really connect you know the way that they are with other people but the moms were using it but teaching the various lessons almost like Karate Kid style through the dogs so like the first day I got there every day I was signed a different role with my wood Shadow one of them and they were 8 they had different responsibilities around the monastery the first day I was in the training center with one of the most of his training the dog and a my job was to be the distractor so rainbow this dog would walk around and I would fucking to Adam and jump and run and like try to deal whatever get him to break his goal of going there what kind of simulating a Park Senior city scene in making this dog not get distracted so I would go nuts the pork chop and this and throat whatever the dog would just go unwavering from point A to point B

<timemark seconds="1346" />

 and the monk said to me at the end is like it's just like life man is like if you have a goal

<timemark seconds="1352" />

 just like rainbows goal is to get from A to B you can't be distracted in your goal and I was like that makes that some karate kid stuff and but all these different lesson started to emerge I was pretty interesting what's a dumb dog looks like a generally thought it was a dog

<timemark seconds="1383" />

 tricyclic what would generally be thought of as a dumb dog there's no like

<timemark seconds="1392" />

 prejudices for dogs is there is like like one breed we like this dumb fucking breed I don't think of like wouldn't go if you say like a dumb dog just dumb individual dogs but I don't ever think of like all that there's some dogs are like spastic right a Jack Russell Terriers are kind of spastic but that's cuz they were raised to kill rats and they just like they're high kill drive and they're super hyper like I can't think of a dog that's supposed to be stupid

<timemark seconds="1424" />

 the German Shepherds originally supposed to be smart list says English Bulldogs but I don't know if that's really think they're just lazy Brutus is half English Bulldog and half Shiba Inu he just has bad joints and he's just lazy he's just tell me you stupid yeah he's kind of a dick he said dick to other dogs but I just think this could is in pain a lot these are super smart are so smart man those dogs look at you and then love their sizing you up checking you out see what the fuck you're up to making sure you cool but there's like this feeling like they know they can kill you like they looking at you like I can kill you but I'm just checking you out I had that feeling that they could kill me to surreal feeling yeah yeah they can and they will like that was scared they were bad just trying to like downtown play my fear that my friend who trains them has a dog that's like he does police work and it's like a serious fucking dog and he'll attack like

<timemark seconds="1485" />

 sing if you're holding like a stick like on command and he jumps and wanted things he does he bites the stick and then to pause go right in your nuts and I don't think it's on purpose but damn it's an effective strategy like it's like bite and then stop all-in-one maneuver right but those dogs are you know they're there a dog that's sort of bread and design for protection work in police work and stuff yeah they aren't they train their dogs for as pets so they didn't do any kind of police work or anything like that so that the 11th German Shepherds they were on the property was super well-behaved I mean like ridiculously well behaved so when are they just train them to make sure that they're obedient and now they just listen watch the house bark at strangers that kind of hand signals obedient you don't not jumping but really that you know they know who's in control so did these guys do that before they started running the monastery or was it something that they decide

<timemark seconds="1545" />

 to do while they had the monastery now so they they fell into it they didn't go up there that none of them had any experience in dog training they that wasn't the intent they said we got to keep the lights on here and they had a dog they had a dog that has a pet and fell in love with the dog and ultimately they when the dog passed away they all got killed they wanted another dog and they went to a breeder and they got two dogs and they actually just they realize that they once they bred an amazing puppy live their first litter that and train these dogs that there is demand and they just scaled it like any other business you know and they learned along the way trial and era just like any entrepreneur Patrol the religious they were Russian Orthodox they weren't enough Buddhist and but they're amazing entrepreneurs

<timemark seconds="1600" />

 I mean like they ran this thing super efficiently so but the point would only be to make enough money to keep the lights on correct so as an entrepreneur it's almost like they're they're Limited in their ambition

<timemark seconds="1614" />

 I think access you know if they have excess money and revenue it's not going to material things but it's for the life and the extension of them of the month Monastery yeah it would save it and put it away for taxes would have you they have you know they're in the hands of God they have been don't have a lot of letters or they don't have a lot of puppies or they have no income that's what do they do for recreation

<timemark seconds="1640" />

 they pray Jesus

<timemark seconds="1643" />

 they think they read what do they read and they have like an amazing collection of books fiction everything yeah I was like fiction yeah and you know periods of it now and up there with no expectation that the only like I heard of monks I watch a scene monks in movies and read articles and blogs but I never I don't know much about it but at the culture certainly about Russian Orthodox and the different factions in this and that so I went up there why is wide open and but I went up there I really just to detach and get away from feeling overloaded and feeling distracted and man I'm a father of four and have a business and a wife has an entrepreneur etcetera and I just wanted to see like you know this is kind of my in my journey I learn best by diving into the unknown just like I did with Dave and just as I have done in businesses and other things it's just like I learn best by going into the unknown

<timemark seconds="1703" />

 why do a lot of research around them or how they made money or this or that I just kind of showed up it's a crazy undertaking but I guess if you knew you only had 15 days at least you have like some Lively on the rainbow when that 15th day came and would you get in the car and drive away from that place yeah I fucking good dude could you check your phone to check my day what's going on on Twitter or 5 I was already kind of making excuse I was rationalizing in my head that seventies would be enough so I can my head I was going home day 7 blind I was like no one's going to know the difference or care if I went 15 days or 7 days or 15 like that's enough it is same kind of thing same kind of thing until you wake up the next day and you like I dropped out you feel like you know so

<timemark seconds="1757" />

 anyway I decided like you know I'm a stick this out and then when I left is it was a good feeling and the feeling was proud I felt proud of myself for sticking through it not is not funny this guy's been there for 50 ft years man yeah I felt good ears when you're describing that that seems so insane to me that I can't even relate but when you talk about your 15 days like man you poor bastard like I feel bad for you the guy that 1550 years he might as well be living in another dimension that is just so nothing no sex no family no no neighborhood nope no fucking Hobbies no drive to work nope Chuck and you know they're their impression of it is like we made this decision so it's not

<timemark seconds="1818" />

 we didn't sacrifice it like we decided this is the life we want to live when he made this decision it was 19 what 1960s that's crazy to decide back then like I I see what's coming and I've had enough yeah I've had enough he's daily newspapers it's just too much information right exactly that's a crazy time to check out so they don't know what the fuck's going on in the world did you quiz them on shit I did really quiz and every Sunday night they have want there's one TV and one back room and they watch the news so they get a sense of just like you know kind of where we are State of the Union yeah yeah yeah they watched about an hour on Sunday night night a week and that's how they tune at who they crazy

<timemark seconds="1873" />

 now and I'm stuck at the monastery the airlines are flying I'm stuck here for another 30 days into my mind went to a place where I was thinking just the worst of everything you know what news do they Trust

<timemark seconds="1891" />

 I think they trust it all but like what which channel do they go to they would just watch like you know the local ABC the local network don't want Netflix options

<timemark seconds="1907" />

 do they have internet

<timemark seconds="1909" />

 I had no access to the internet I think they have access probably further yeah but I don't know access to the dog training Jesus Christ it was wild but why is that so romantic people cuz it is it's very romantic right there something about this idea of checking out just had a buddy did it for all I know he still does it I lost touch of them 25 plus years ago but he was a Taekwondo guy and he started to meditate because he was always very nervous about sparring and very nervous about competition so he was trying to figure out what was going on so you said let me just take some meditation classes took some meditation classes and really enjoyed it got really really into it and then

<timemark seconds="1958" />

 one day decided to give up all the worldly possessions and all of the trappings of civilization and move into the monastery and remember we met him for lunch one day and vegetarians who eat vegetables and we were all just hanging around and he seemed oddly a piece and it was so confusing to me because of the time I was like, 20 and I was just didn't know what the fuck is going on the world who's maybe 10 years older than me I just decided I've had enough just put weird to me that he made me nervous like you know like you made me nervous that like he was on something it may be nervous that he was wiser than me that it highlighted how fucked up I am and you know specially at 20 years it's so life is so chaotic right no idea what the future holds for you if it's going to be success or failure if you're going to slip it every fucking

<timemark seconds="2018" />

 an appeal you run across

<timemark seconds="2019" />

 they seem to have it figured out sitting there eating vegetables all calm and shit where is he now I've no idea I lost touch with him you know probably like 30 years ago but when I was 20 those guys freak me out to see you know why Ryan likes probably probably at this particular place I think for an extended period time like that yeah what what why they let you do it

<timemark seconds="2059" />

 about that I've written about prior living with a seal and they knew I was coming up there to write a book and I guess they like the first book I'm sure it'll be good for the dog business to yeah yeah but will you Lottery books by you were there I was allowed to have I brought I'm not like a big reader so I figure two bucks would carry me for a few days turned 15 days that I ride a bike in a red bulletin like the first one read the stupid shit yeah I said I'm good just thinking wow so was there any point at like day 13 when you like I actually kind of like this yes

<timemark seconds="2107" />

 I think around 871 so I realize like you know I got the excuses out of my head that I'm staying I'm not I'm not leaving I mean this this is what I'm doing and I settled into it I got tremendously energized because like at the monastery you don't make any decisions that you eat when they tell you to eat you eat what they tell you to eat you go to service when the church bell rings you go over one outfit I showered once so all these decisions were taken away from you but when all the decisions are taken away from you it freeze up so much energy so I was looking like super clear and I was like I like this this is like no one can get to me I'm not getting bombarded no one can schedule appointments with me this isn't so bad

<timemark seconds="2152" />

 if you ever done the sensory deprivation tank

<timemark seconds="2156" />

 there's the thing about the sensory deprivation do you know what it is right now the thing that's most interesting about it is that in the absence of input your brain is Freer and you can make decisions better think about things better because there's no input coming in you don't think about it but as we're sitting here just touching this table is in each other across and in that tank there's no input and in the absence of input it frees up more resources for your brain so in a sense with these monks you're saying or doing by having everything on a schedule you not to think about anything and there's nothing coming in there's no Twitter Facebook All That Jazz your you have more resources correct and you feel better and I experience that I think the average American makes like 35,000 50,000 decisions a day and there's a real thing called decision to feel fatigued yeah and when you eliminate

<timemark seconds="2217" />

 when I came home I came home and the day I got home my wife is like sweetie I'm going to take the kids to you know school and imma take the blue car I was like cool take the blue car and she came back a minute later you know what I don't think the other car because I want to park in Blue Cars too big and it's like I could take you out the car and then she came back in because you know what I'm going to take the blue car but so much energy or ready it's 7:45 a.m. I'm a car to drive and I realize like that happens all the time you know it's like exhausting then I just saying like when you know I don't have any of that so freed up all this energize making like massive lifeless what I want to do I became very aware of my relationship with time I mean when we think of relationships we think about relationships with our mom or a dad or kids or this and that but like no one thinks of relationship of time and I'm turning 50 the average American lives to be 78 years old so

<timemark seconds="2278" />

 find average hope I'm not that means I got 28 years of life left if you reverse engineer that if you reverse engineer it you like I just climbed Mount Washington new Note 7 year olds climbing out Washington the act the actual years that you have left to be active and do the shit that we want to do they shrink significantly as a percentage as you get older so once you're aware of your relationship with time everything shifts not a fundamental shift when I came home with as a release to my relationship with time and who I want to spend it with and what I want to do I want to put more on my plate of the stuff that I love to do with the people I love to do it with and I started getting like a lot of clarity around that when I wasn't getting from farted with everything else like I don't spend any time alone the only time I spend alone is worth I go for a run everything else cuz I'm getting influenced by everybody else and everything else so I'm losing my pain superpower

<timemark seconds="2338" />

 my instinct would not survive survive on Instinct and gut and I was losing that because I was so distracted so once I started to get that alone time I was there to do it just got it in a carving out a little bit of time for myself everyday I started to think a lot clearer on like you know how do I want to live reverse-engineer the rest of my life

<timemark seconds="2360" />

 do you think this is something you would do on a regular basis now but I'm it's something that I have and I feel like you know like I said like going into the unknown it gives you an edge you know it gives you come out of it a little bit different than you go and it doesn't have to be a monastery could be a race it could be business experience whatever but just doing something different doing it different because you know so yeah I feel like it's I want I don't think I would do it again but I think I have to because I already have I can tap into that when I need it you think that'll wear off though cuz a lot of times inspiration for people it's it's it's leading the takeaways won't won't wear off like I'm already back on my phone when I'm back in modern day life I'm all fucked up again but the main things like my relationship with time and certain things of you know who I want to spend it with and what I want to do and continuing to feel what I call my life resume doing these things to build up my not my business resume but

<timemark seconds="2423" />

 life resume that's things that I know I want to do more of and that will never go away so you know there's just things that came out of it that will last forever to message Mike when he came back start saying no start-up I like I just I reverse engineer my lights let me give you an example my parents are 88 okay have a good relationship with my parents my parents are ADHD live in Florida I see my parents and my parents live to be 90 to I hope they live longer blessed with 5 years

<timemark seconds="2457" />

 I don't have five years left with my parents I see my parents twice a year that means I have pain visits with my parents so when I started to look at shit like that

<timemark seconds="2470" />

 I made significant changes like okay imma get on the plane see my parents and when I'm in those moments my feet are on the ground that's where I am because I only have a limited amount of time with them you understand 6 not 5 years how many times you see a man you see him 2 times a year you got 10 visits so I I just started looking at stuff like that and became really aware when I'm in moments that are big moments to take it in and take note of it so it has an impact on me and I appreciate it did you shift anything else in your life as far as like what you do with your time during the days I did it so you know I started putting parameters around simple things like my phone so like I was the guy at the movie theater I'll be checking my own thing I'd like my shirt to the light doesn't light up and know what you know at least you did that mission courteous keeping my phone in at night

<timemark seconds="2531" />

 I'm in Canarsie they can come in at 5 in the morning nothing at the dinner table with my kids and so I face it obvious things like that but as far as my time I made two really big changes one changes and I kind of always been doing this I want that sell you say it was a change but I take 3 hours a day for myself religiously every day. Just it's it's it's kind of like it's on wavering since the monastery kind of been in my life and out of my life but I just made a pie chart of time 24 hours in a day we all have the same pie chart starts the same and that's what I sleep 7 hours I mean sometimes I'm out of balance if I'm doing something big and put right now 6 or 7 hours I take three for myself and it's Kim with it so I guess I'll pick the beep I'm a go for an hour run I'm a sit in the sauna for 20 minutes I'm going to fucking nothing but went out in my time I'm not mad that I'm

<timemark seconds="2591" />

 with my kids or My Wife Er or I'm not mad and I'm out of my office like that's my time and when I'm with my kids I'm not mad that I'm at work or whatever so I don't want to resent my wife for my boss or anybody for taking away the shit that I left to do like if they said you can't run you can't go in the sauna I do really pissed off I've been missing my wife I'll be pissed at everybody so I take 3 hours for myself the average American Works 40 hours a week that's 8 hours a day you still have 6 hours left in the day and of course you have to eat if the commute you have family in this and that but my point is even take 24 hours long day

<timemark seconds="2629" />

 I learned that running you can get a lot of shit done if you keep moving for 24 hours even if you take 3 hours for yourself if you get rid of the stuff that doesn't move the needle in the buckets that are most important to you you can get a lot done so I take 3 hours for myself and that's been a you know and I'm not mad about it I'm not like guilty about it at all I feel like I'm way out of balance and then the second thing actually didn't come from the monastery but it was like kind of an offshoot of the monastery I was mentioned to you that I climb Mount Washington Mount Washington in the winter is one of the 10 most dangerous mountains I think the climb certainly in the States has the highest death rate because the winds are thoughts about anywhere from on any given day 5200 miles an hour minus 35 degrees no visibility fucking it's just a hundred miles an hour yeah what the fuck is that it's an experience that I experienced

<timemark seconds="2690" />

 super high winds like when did you experience 50 I need more 50 60 apps for the first time I went twice the first time I went to do it I didn't make it to the summit is it was too dangerous I tie the Ashley timed out like I don't have time to get back to make it an altitude no just in the amount of Darkness Darkness get back down I was just five friends know tour guide I mean did everything wrong and I actually came home after that attempt which was a year ago and I was talking to my wife about it and I was getting I posted on Facebook so everybody was blasted to make it in about 4 or 5 miles to the top four point six miles just the elements in the weather that make it so hard and I said to my wife I failed you know I got it make it feel like an ass I'm so disappointed and I want to go back and she said we'll get it tour guide

<timemark seconds="2748" />

 breaking your boots to properly trained for this and go back next winter and check it off your list I was like next winter I'm going back on Saturday who knows if I have next winter so I went back next winter time next week that Saturday with the same guys and we did it and then recently this year I took my son who's 8 not to the top but like we will camp out I want you to experience this got him a -40 sleeping bag and all the stuff we went out there with my friend is a police officer and Suffolk County he brought his daughter and was sitting out there sleeping outside fucking freezing fucking freezing and I'm all bundled up and I turned to him and I'm like Kevin how long should you do shit like this you know he's a police officer is the happiest guys rock star shape and it goes

<timemark seconds="2800" />

 I called the cabin roll he goes every year I go on one trip a year with my college roommates be doing since I'm 21

<timemark seconds="2810" />

 and then once every two months I take a weekend and I do something I go camping I run a marathon or go hiking I'll go to me whatever with my family or friends and I said to myself if I can't going back to your question about time if I can take a weekend

<timemark seconds="2828" />

 every 8 weeks once every two months I can't car that day or two to take some kind of Adventure to put on my life resume but I have to collect a moment for me that my life is out of balance. Called the cabin Rule and I said if I live 30 more years I'll let the 18 and I do that you know for 30 years it's a hundred and fifty or hundred is 150 more fucking amazing memories that I'm going to create and that became another one of these time-related Monastery related urgency rules so I just again it just became a real big Clarity around like man I want to live with urgency and I want to do as much as I can and put as much on my plate of the stuff I love to do with the people I love in my life and have it on my resume and that's how I want to live my life for it that's very inspiring so when you decided to cut out or carve out 3 hours a day for yourself what was the first ship to you eliminated

<timemark seconds="2889" />

 literally just saying no to the request for my time you think you can meet me for lunch I want to talk to you about it a business idea that I have in the average space I know that you had your coconut water I want to talk to you about that now

<timemark seconds="2906" />

 I'm going for a run yeah oh no I don't want any money I don't want any money I just want to talk to you for 15 mins a friend of mine I know you think I'm Friday night you can come down if it's either know cuz it's cumulative right it's not one to listen I made by one person ever no no it's going to be one person every day or so with some new request so that was the first shift in the second thing is for the fan I put myself first you know in a lot of times I don't but in certain times I do and I realized that I was this is kind of make might be a little bit more specific but I realized I love football

<timemark seconds="2950" />

 I watch a lot of football man I realize that I was watching two games college game on Saturday fantasy football Sunday I'm locked in Sunday night game Monday night Thursday night and I realized that if at this point if I live to be 85 and whatever that would be 36000 hours of football 36000 hours of football but I be watching that throw in some of the fights doing some of the other stuff it's like I pulled the plug out and I just freed up just 36 of them out of saying like 15 days sweetie I just freed up 36000 hours you get the benefit of that I'm going for 15 days

<timemark seconds="2994" />

 so I freed up the time by eliminating stuff that like fucking didn't move the needle so you stop watching football told her I still watch it but I I mean I became very aware of it and I was like yeah so watch it but I check in I'm not sitting around on Sunday nothing wrong with it it's just it wasn't moving the needle in my family my finances are my Wellness Recreation does Recreation time is that valuable liked enjoying things sitting back and watching good movie enjoying absolutely and I do I do but I'm not I'm not you know I'm asking for myself as much as I can for you yeah I mean I think lucky got to be happy and do the things you like to do but you know again for me I look at it I'll look at it very simply I got three or four buckets I got my family my Wellness by my finances and causes that important to me and you know if it's not moving the needle nose for buckets it's really just

<timemark seconds="3055" />

 honestly I know that doesn't mean I'm not going to go to movie that's family that's well it's part of my Wellness relaxing is part of my Wellness you want to go but you know those are kind of everything else can I get to know like going to lunch to 2 to look at someone else's idea in a category I don't really know much about because they want a baby get to me or they want my wife for no no

<timemark seconds="3077" />

 no no no big t-shirt I get it when I was starting out as an entrepreneur when I was 20 years old you know and I was cleaning kiddie pools do in the music business as them all this stuff I laugh a lot of jokes that one funny you know what I mean to get deals to get stuff out of laugh laugh and I'm sick of laughing at jokes that are funny

<timemark seconds="3105" />

 that's actually very funny like you saying that is very funny to smart thing to do but in the beginning it's very hard right because you were trying to get momentum be trying to establish relationships here you want people like you you don't want to dead face a stupid joke pics so you laugh

<timemark seconds="3128" />

 so do you organize your time like very specifically now and did you do that in the past I do now I didn't the path cuz you know in the past I do it I'ma Do I need some I say yes to to action things without really thinking them through very often now what I do is I have a third grade that's a three-year-old system I have two notebooks I'm kind of old school at I don't really operate well keep his stuff in phones I just take everything that comes into my head I put it on I dumped it out of my head to free up space in my head I have one Journal that has everything I need to do and I just do that to get it out of my head so I don't remember that I have to get my son's friends 8 year old birthday present for Saturday's write it down doesn't mean it goes away but it's out of my head right and then I have my daily from that list I picked the most important things that have to get done and then right before I write them down or what

<timemark seconds="3190" />

 King of the week as knock'em out man

<timemark seconds="3193" />

 how long ago was it that you went to this Monastery and did this fear in the year that one year ago and has this enthusiasm or this feeling Wayne that all know how interesting do you think do you conveyed that in the book

<timemark seconds="3208" />

 I do I mean I've been living I feel like I've been living my life like this even before the monastery just reinforced a lot of things I think combined with the fact that for some reason you know I'm turning 50 it's had its fucking with me in a way that I didn't think it would and I don't know how you are with you yes so I don't know if you have had the same impact on you but like you know there's not a day that goes by where I don't say to myself man in 30 years you turning 80 urgency and

<timemark seconds="3243" />

 I feel like my enemies the clock and has a lot of stuff I want to do in my life and my enemies the clock do you feel like you live in the moment enough

<timemark seconds="3256" />

 how does all that you do I do cuz that would be the worry right like if you were constantly worrying about 20 years of movie 70 30 years in V8 if you keep doing that like they're there are people that look ahead too much and don't just in time I talk to people that are 20 like fuck I can't believe him 20 you just turned 20 dude relax no man I'm going to be fucking 30 + 10 years like you shut the fuk up you 20 now I use it as a motivator and I remember I remember when I was when I was starting out I was 21 years old is a crazy story I just got dropped from a record label assigned to a record label called delicious vinyl how do you do just with tone Loke and Young MC my album doesn't get picked I don't get picked up for second album and I moved to New York City have two things on my resume Kitty pool attendant cuz I was at

<timemark seconds="3317" />

 people attending and rapper so I'm staying on my friend's couch living on his couch with his roommate and he tells me on Monday I got to get out of the apartment so instead of going to look for a new apartment over the weekend I go to my friend's bachelor party on the Jersey Shore I'm at the bachelor party I'm getting a drink at the bar and I see this girl I start chatting with her she asked me where I live I told her actually has a Monday I have nowhere to go she takes out a napkin she writes her dress on a napkin I'm 21 years old and she says if it's an emergency on Monday and you're stuck you can come live with me Monday comes I got kicked out of my friend's apartment I've nowhere to go on like this is an emergency I take out the napkin and I live with this girl and her roommate for 6 months turns out that her father is a big I trippin or business my owns a piece of the Yankees dislike monster mogul

<timemark seconds="3371" />

 I write the song for the New York Knicks called go New York go and it becomes a big success and I just realized that there's an opportunity right theme songs for all these professional sports teams but I don't have a penny to go in the studio to do the demos to stop them to the team so I need money should I go to this music guy and he says I'll give you $10,000 to go into the songs for 10% of everything you make for the rest of your life he wants to buy me like a stop the rest of your life I'm 21 business so I say I'll take it so before I take it I go to this girl's father for advice this business Mogul that I'm living with her and I sit down I go to this guy's apartment again I'm 21

<timemark seconds="3432" />

 got in his Partners got a swimming pool artwork like fancy fuck women he's knocked out man it's like I've never seen anything like this in Manhattan I'm just setting the stage of the shower station and I go in and I tell him the story about the two dependent and he says to me

<timemark seconds="3453" />

 I would trade this is exactly what you said to me I will trade everything that I have my daughter's life

<timemark seconds="3461" />

 exactly I'll trade everything I have for the one thing that you have I don't like me a fucking broke but he told me I go watch that and he said youth because he had already gone through the Journey even though we had everything she already gone through the process he wasn't that 20 year old that you're talking about that whatever he had gone through it he had it all she she would she missed the process the Journey of being you coming up to 20 and not know like here you are but it was the first fight the first dance like that that's what that's what makes you like so and that stuck with me man at 21 years old it's stuck with me and realize that like man I got to enjoy the process and it's really never rubbed off on me in front of me

<timemark seconds="3516" />

 well why didn't that guy how old was this guy at the time the old Rich dude he was Lucy must Miss 60s what I just do shit do a bunch of shit did lounge around and he had an amazing life he had an amazing life so what did you want to do when he set the SEC the second part of the conversation you said do you will you make this work on your own I said I think I can he said I can ask if you can he said I said you said will you make it work I said I will he said then go tell the guy to fuck off and make it because I'm going to make it work and I did so how'd you get it funded then I somehow got I went to the Dallas Mavericks after the Knicks and told them that I convinced them to give me a $2,500 the next pay me this is the crazy part of my life but they gave me $2,500 to do the demo and then they bought the song for like $20,000 and that funded

<timemark seconds="3577" />

 cast of the business that I ultimately sold to a public company that's crazy and you almost gave away 10% of your whole life that guy wanted 10% is a piece of shit mother fucker but that's a steal and I10 Grand hymns probably nothing I called my father my father on the plumbing supply house in Mineola Long Island and during this time in my thing and my father said you know that I love them to death but he's like you know do it do what you think is best

<timemark seconds="3616" />

 you know I don't know what I want to know what to turn to don't don't give up 10% your life that I ever but you hear things like two similar to what they do in the music business like how the music business treats artist they essentially sign you to these contracts and then take a piece of everything they take a piece of if you do a movie to take a piece of your live performances your merchandise sales everything they just say look real will help you out a little bit but you know we want you right now is your in a contract though but there's some creepy contract that they used to do in the old days of Hollywood that were similar to that right they just take a PC at forever yeah but you know what I signed my music deal care whatever you want man get me on MTV

<timemark seconds="3668" />

 I have is what they don't have give Talent right what you have is your creative you're young and full of energy and you got something exciting the people want to look at and so would they do is they got what we got a fucking that way through the door but we want 75% of profits we want a little bit of this and you don't get any money back until we were Cooper money that we spent on Executives and parking in car leases and they calculate all that shit how much the fucking building costs how much the electricity all that stuff they got it's because you've seen those I'm sure oh yeah is contractor fucking sorry man I've signed on my own way now but you know it's part of the process and no leverage no leverage that's the thing they've got the leverage but now and now they don't have delivered but they still figure out a way to pull it off it's really weird cuz who the fuck is buying an albums now no right no one is still figuring out a coin

<timemark seconds="3737" />

 and you like a lamprey suck blood out

<timemark seconds="3740" />

 is still staying alive and they're fat fingers driving there fat Mercedes-Benz they know how to do it they just figure out a way to grab people that are just just getting Poppin you know and just sign it and then figure out a way to get in with these fucking streaming companies have you paid attention to that shadow that yeah that's the darkest it's even darker than the music distribution yeah cuz you already skipped like no money .001 Steven Tyler actually core the organization's actually called MMA what is something would it would it stand for musicians for some sort of an act where they do you know trying to stop the streaming companies from ripping off these artists modernization Act

<timemark seconds="3796" />

 people figuring out a way to just take something from somebody cuz you need it you know you're broke you're desperate your son decide to contract I log out of a contract and soon as I get in the music that was invented like how they put Led Zeppelin on streaming service

<timemark seconds="3819" />

 it's truth audio books do you know I mean even bucks now and all these old Publications they never envisioned that they would be you know I P ebooks and audiobooks and honors different distribution

<timemark seconds="3840" />

 areas would imagine audio books probably near the sales of regular books now I know something at least in my circle I know so many people who just use audio books in the heart that I was just dead air and filled it up with books I can't win when I when sealed when I put it steelbook I couldn't believe how many people hit me back the audio cuz I did my own audiobook and I just couldn't I didn't even that came out 2 years ago and it just never dawned on me that people even listen to audiobooks Ryan. It may be angry that I did the Reed so quickly should have been a little bit more time like this kind of coach or something right you know I just like Reddit

<timemark seconds="3888" />

 what percentage of your books were audio versus paper the good question

<timemark seconds="3894" />

 I'm going to go down to guess about 30% e 430 40% on cast right

<timemark seconds="3911" />

 now when you're done with this book and you know you you get back from this monk thing and you you realize that this is made like some sort of a fundamental shift in the way you live your life and you put this book out is there a real sense that people who read this book are going to get that from you and I mean are you aware that you're probably going to change the way a lot of people live their lives I hope so I'm at I don't know if they'll change the lies but I think it I hope I hope that it helps them look through things through a different lens and you don't make their own decisions you know I wanted to take away from the book isn't so much a specific around the monastery it's around this notion of building your life resume you know and just stepping into the unknown cuz to me that's weird for me that's why I learn the best I can get a traditional culture go to seminars or experts but I just don't learn to learn by going into the unknown and I hope it just it just motivates people to have a little bit more urgency and do stuff like

<timemark seconds="3977" />

 yeah but you know there's an old Japanese ritual you might be familiar with it I don't know call them is soggy and the thought around the Muskogee is it was introduced me to me by Kyle Korver played at the Hawks for the Atlanta Hawks and the the notion around the Muskogee is you do something so hard one time of year that it has an impact the other 364 days of the year on you that you go so far beyond you know for me that was my Hundred Mile Run I mean I can look back since 2008 I've had moments like that every year but and I believe in that I believe in that and

<timemark seconds="4021" />

 no I just brought that up but but it's true and it's just kind of one of the themes around this urgency and and you know creating memories Sarah things like that sort of highlight that urgency that if you just live your life like at the same steady static Pace sometimes you don't feel it as much like I'm sure after you did your hundred mile run like when it was over you probably probably felt so good to relax the first of all from me the the pressure around completing the run when I did the Run II raised millions of dollars for charity and everyone in my world knew I was doing it I gave myself 90 days to train for it

<timemark seconds="4071" />

 I would say like for the people of the shape that I wasn't going into a probably year 8 months 6 months I mean I mean I give myself 90 days I started in August and then the race was 90 days later and everyone in my world was donating or involved and knew about it so if I didn't finish it so much can go wrong in a hundred mile run you know like something goes wrong in a marathon at Mile 19 you got it out you got 7 more miles let you know something goes wrong amount 1981 miles left you can most people can't cut that out I don't think I could

<timemark seconds="4108" />

 I felt so relieved when it was done cuz I was like man I did it and no one can take it away from me what was a long as you wrote not written ran before that I'm at to 5250 s 250 my time so I did to 10 hour. 10 hour runs twice and 50 miles and 10 hours probably around there so yeah so but you knew that you were at the halfway mark roughly you could push to the rest I knew that if I got 250 miles if I could get to 50 miles and 10 hours I could be some even injured walk the rest the allocated time after that was over and after you did do that 100 miles how much of a shift did that make in the way you thought about time and effort totally changed my life completely completely talk about this Muskogee and completely changed my life that wasn't 2000

<timemark seconds="4169" />

 and 6 I think that I did the run and it's completely changed my life because when I started running my goal was to Run 2 miles if I can run 2 miles and 18 minutes 9 minute pace I consider myself a runner and I work towards that goal if I got to college I was like just got out of college I'm going to try to run 2 miles you know like it took me a little to get there in 9 minute pace and fast forward I ran this nothing in my body changed does the same legs guy gave me some lugs guy gave me I'm not very strong nothing's changed but I took that to my body

<timemark seconds="4209" />

 and ran a hundred miles I bet almost a lot of people that listen this could run to my house and put the gun to their head they could run 2 miles if they had 2 and the only thing that changed was the way I perceive what I thought I could do in this run and I realized after the race that holy shit I did 50 x what my initial goal was like I was under indexing 50 x in this category of my life what are the areas of My Life Jesse what other areas of your life man are you under indexing in like okay if your sales quota at Marquis jet my company was 20 Jack cards is that cuz I knew I could get it and it was comfortable or should I put on the 4th of this month let me see what the fuck I can do when I was living in this like, I was going through life like this

<timemark seconds="4261" />

 routine and routines are great but routines can also be a rut you can't get better in a routine and if you get soaked when you're in a routine time goes fast when you add your team time go slow so I was so comfortable and everything like that fuck it I don't go through life like this I want to go through life like this you know and I was busy I'm going out to Mom's phone from you I was going flat you know I'm doing the same shit and nice 45 degree angle so this this run showed me man I was under indexing so much what I thought I was capable of the Navy think like what else am I capable of what about recovery like what was it like when you were done

<timemark seconds="4309" />

 well at mile 94 I realized I had six toenails in my shoe so that was an uncomfortable feeling and when I felt them rattle rattle around and when I took my shoes off my feet was so fucked up is it because your feet swell while you're running and you if you have like a size 10 you're supposed to swap out to a size 11 later. When I swapped I want to size up but I blister that bad blisters my blisters were really bad and I got them as I was going and they look like I literally look like I swallowed red grapes and they went to the bottom of each of my toe and it is just so I was in a wheelchair for 4 days after the race to the bottom that the blisters and

<timemark seconds="4360" />

 you know but so for me for me just like a regular guy

<timemark seconds="4367" />

 it was a bit was a very powerful moment for me you know and it was worth it was worth it was all well well well worth it once I was done I realize like I'm I'm okay I'm not shocked I'm not dehydrated I'm just in super pain that was a great moment and I have a regret from that race like one of the biggest regrets in my life like I don't like the way I finished the race I ran 99 miles of The Last Mile took me 48 minutes and literally had to like grab my show my brother's shoulders and like I just if I could do it all over I wanted to really finish that Like A Champion you know and I was just very disappointed I'm happy about it but I also one of my biggest regrets from the race is just that you know I got to that moment where and I just didn't finish it the way I wanted to finish it was wrong

<timemark seconds="4417" />

 call me my sucking joints like my hips and my knees would just like swollen just so much from just so much pain they were just it was just so at 75 I fell. I just kind of like was running and I'll sit on the ground because like I buckled cuz they was it was my joint not my muscles just like my you like I said if you if you roll your thumb around for 24 hours at Sam's going to fall off but I know it's a cyst that motion and pounding and and and I don't know what I was like hot and I was like I did everything wrong but I did it

<timemark seconds="4454" />

 and when you did get done with the wheelchair for 4 days how long does it take for your body felt normal like your joints normalize your hips and your knees and took about two over the little over 2 weeks wow yeah she's hobbling around for 2 weeks thinking about it now so huge cyst like from all the stress on my on my foot that I've had ham sized how big was it like big enough I can't wear shoes what I wear sneakers that like yeah I'll show you a picture later. I got to drain twice and then I went to like a real Echo almost fruitarian diet and went away is all fruit

<timemark seconds="4507" />

 why did that do it

<timemark seconds="4509" />

 I don't know why you try fruits with vegetables or fruits with anything else sign up for 27 years I've only had food till 12 noon that's why I eat in the morning but I extended that out further and it went away on its own from fruit I don't know if that's the reason why you be over I just want to get away but I made some significant changes in my diet

<timemark seconds="4535" />

 yeah so what but what led you to be the fruitarian idea I write a book called Fit for Life when I was right for my first marathon I was 21 and 22 years old like looking for an h and in the book it challenges the reader to try to eat one of the principles of the book is the only fruit until noon we can talk about it but the challenges that we needed to try for 10 days and then day 11 go back to regular breakfast and see how you feel so I did like I could invest 10 days to try this and add a 11 I went back to oatmeal and toast or whatever and I was like oh my God man I feel so sluggish and like bloated and I was like I never went back and it's and that that's unwavering I'm unwavering on that I run marathon never changes through till noon and so that's why

<timemark seconds="4590" />

 the one of these people eat in the monastery so they have a very light breakfast that suited me well they fruit in the morning and then their lunch they called dinner that's their big meal so the afternoon like dinner and then at night it was super light like soup and salad or whatever she's really like almost one meal a day but their vegetarian somewhere but others weren't

<timemark seconds="4613" />

 that's what you're not all of them where was which was interesting did you expect them to be I did I lost a lot of weight there I was like 17 lb 7 oz yeah yeah when you think it's lack of sugar no carbs and sugar one the other day they did I didn't and I wanted to put aloe astrix next to mine and I went in there saying to myself I didn't want to have I want to come back clean so I really did try not to have any grains and I did have some grains but not not a lot and I walked a lot I walked a hundred twenty miles over the time I was there up and down the driveway and sidewalk so I lost all the weight I gained it all back but at the time you now these people that live this life

<timemark seconds="4662" />

 do they have something there working towards do they have an idea that they're working towards the mean when you when you press them on it and ask them like why you hear you ever plan on leaving you ever see yourself going somewhere else that's a really good question I ask them all those questions so I know they felt like that was their calling them if they were doing what they were supposed to be doing and

<timemark seconds="4684" />

 that they were committed to that lifestyle so no they weren't there was no thought of going back

<timemark seconds="4693" />

 it happened monks that have left the monastery just wasn't the right lifestyle for them but the months that were there when I was there in 50 years they were committed and they're not going anywhere when you say this word confusing to me like I understand that they're enjoying and I understand that they like that life but that that it's our calling like the calling to do nothing or just think fastest sacrifice serve God

<timemark seconds="4723" />

 live a life of Purity this is not right. I couldn't do it but I think that's kind of the mindset around it and

<timemark seconds="4733" />

 step away from

<timemark seconds="4736" />

 the regular life that they were living what's interesting is it that they were born into the monastery why do these guys made this decision in their 20s 30s you know so jobs before they did it all over the board all over the board literally one guy one of the most is a lifeguard is a teenager all over the board so regular jobs just always felt connected to God and connected to this higher living a life too you know under these terms why did was fascinating to me that you're saying that they're so happy because if you get a rat me how many how many people are in this Monastery but 8 and they're all male yes eight men if you get a random men in their you know what's the youngest age of the guys are there be 5:35 gas 70s you get eight random 35 to 7 is now is how many of them a happy actually truly happy

<timemark seconds="4797" />

 maybe to write how many people do you think you're happy or they just did a study there's a famous Harris study on happiness in this country I think 67% of people are unhappy. It's fucked here's what I did this Jojo This is a good test maybe you want to do this I did this when I was speaking at an event for 500 Wall Street people recently and it was fast and I'll take you tell me if you're comfortable with it but did you take all the areas of your life and put them in a blender okay so take where you live your relationships your finances your health you everything everything put it in one fucking big blender and blend it up and on a scale of 1 to 10 with attending the Dalai Lama of happiness and a one being a guy that's it rock with zero being some of this is rock bottom

<timemark seconds="4846" />

 what your happiness number happy

<timemark seconds="4852" />

 I don't know I wouldn't do it that way I definitely wouldn't give it a number okay cuz I feel like the year of you making something you're you're turning like a constant state of thinking and expression and consideration you're turning into a number and I just I don't like that idea I don't like that idea because I think it's a management issue I think a lot of What happiness is a management issue and decisions that you're making right now like you could be in a shit state of mind right now but you can make some decisions to adjust that in over the next couple hours you'll get to a much better place and these constant management decisions they waiver in and out of your life on a daily basis like this idea that you could have a good mindset and also you'll be happy that's horseshit like it's that's like it's like the tide it comes in and it comes out as going to be days where you just not feeling so good physically and that's going to affect the way your happiness level is

<timemark seconds="4912" />

 never static it's not exactly the same true but if you looked at it overall at 30000 feet and you had to give yourself a great we sleepy as fuck is what I would say okay so you're happy okay I'll take that I'll take that most people in that room raise their I said if anyone is 7 and you know anyone that listening and wants to do it raise your hand if you're you know 7 or below I want to put him on the spot and majority the room stood up being a 7 and thinking you know like 7 so pretty happy number but its 7

<timemark seconds="4946" />

 if my son comes home with a 70 on a test

<timemark seconds="4949" />

 c-minus and all I'm saying is what was interesting about the test though if you'd actually go through the process for those that like go through that and get a number and their head or whatever you want to give yourself a great friend your brain or automatically goes to attend and then subtract the two or three things Poppin that make you better bring your happiness down it's a great way to identify what's making you unhappy and that you know what I mean like I started my relationship but they said that usually it triggers an automatic like this is was fucked up in my life response and you cannot it helps you identify but it's interesting we have benchmarks and so many things in our life you have an IQ test you have tax brackets to measure your your wealth or financial statements you have IQ test like I said you can get on a scale to measure your weight but you're right happiness is one of those things it's like how do you bench Market you know what I mean if you're out of fluctuates and it's like hunger I mean it's it's it's it's something that's goes in and out

<timemark seconds="5010" />

 always there but happy as fuck is a good answer but this is something I've cultivated for a long time and avoided things that make me unhappy and figure out what those things are I've been very rigid about eliminating them from my life and one of the big ones is eliminating interactions with people that are negative that is gigantic because I realize that I'm not really as independent as I used to like to think I was I just like to think that my thought process was independent and that I don't give a fuck what anybody thinks that's nonsense people say that because they absolutely care what people think and it bothers them so they say I don't give a fuck but that I don't give a fuck stuff is almost entirely nonsense you do care and you care in both ways you care if people critical of you care if people are positive you but you also care if people live in positive lives and their motivating you that's that's a big one people

<timemark seconds="5070" />

 Fuel and other people that's one of the reasons why I like talking to people won the reasons why I like to do podcast because I get a lot out of you know I just talked to you about your time in the monastery or your push to get to that hundred miles you get energy out of people like that and you think about this energy and you think about this inspiration when you doing other things and it also sets in your mind that when you meet these exceptional people that move you like what are the characters what are the qualities they have what are the characteristics that they that they possessed and those things become significant an important to you wear as if you live around a bunch of people that are complaining and bitching about everything and they see the negative and everything and they're always whining those people are the opposite of that did the opposite of inspiration and they just they're there mud usually it's like you're up to your ankles and Bud you try to trudge through life it's difficult you're not light it's not it's not pushing it is not a window

<timemark seconds="5130" />

 back the winds in your face and it's rough you know end

<timemark seconds="5134" />

 over time I've learned that these people you just if you're not going to fix some ice and want to fix them when I was young I just want to go hey man I see what you doing like dude don't do that anymore listen just try just I just do this and then stop doing that and start doing this and if you just work towards this you could be successful and then a week later the guys doing the same shit and like all right I'm wasting a significant amount of my energy on someone who doesn't want to waste any of their energy on themselves and so managing the community in the tribe that you're in making sure that you are a good member of that tribe that you're doing your part you know and there's a lot of cynicism in these days about inspiration and about motivation because there's a lot of fake shit you know you can go on Instagram and you see a million of these inspirational quote pages and there were run by people that are probably depressed you know you see a lot of people that are you know talking about how to get a

<timemark seconds="5195" />

 and in life but they're not really doing anything themselves so there's a lot of cynicism involved in that but there's also sincerity in it and you can get if you just look at it with a pure heart and in your mind you can get a lot of energy out of that and when you are around happy inspirational people that are successful it makes you feel better and you get inspired and if you act on that inspiration your life would be more fulfilled and it's not just inspirational in terms of financial success but in terms of doing difficult things whether it's running a hundred miles doesn't pay you a goddamn thing other than the the the the wealth of the knowledge that you can push yourself to such an extreme or anything else whether it's someone who becomes a really good at playing chess or someone is really good at martial arts or whatever it is there's there's a great feeling in these overcoming these difficult things cuz life is never this just constant state of I'm at a 9 oz

<timemark seconds="5255" />

 day when I'm with my wife I hit 10 yay and I stay like that that's not real what's real is like you saying that you went to this Monastery and felt all this this angst about meditating and being alone and not having your phone and not having the info but then when it comes out of it then you have this reward so you you push through this and you had these uncomfortable feelings and you came out of those uncomfortable feelings with this newfound appreciation for time and his newfound respect for your own existence in your own space and carving Out 3 hours for yourself a day that's where it all comes from it all comes from life lessons in the lessons are learned through struggle and I think that there's a lot of people out there that think somehow or another you going to get to someplace where you live in silk sheets and you getting your toes done while someone's dropping grapes in your mouth I don't want that I've never wanted that you that guy's not going to be happy

<timemark seconds="5315" />

 keyboard hour into the grapes you can get those fucking grapes away for me stop painting my toes what am I doing in this bed I got to do something I'm not stimulated the human organism the animal we are needs constant stimulation because it evolve trying to find food and Escape enemies and find shelter Escape Naturescape the elements try to survive and this is the great joy that you haven't taken care of your children so you can protect your children from the elements in the enemies and feed them in and it's also the great sadness that you see and losers when I see a loser I see some guys 43 years old lives in his parents basement fucking hates the world that was a baby this is a baby that somebody just gave shity nutrients to whether its nutrients the forms of food or in the form of thoughts and ideas and examples and this kid develop these horrible self-defeating patterns of behavior

<timemark seconds="5374" />

 lead them to this point where there is this middle-aged person with no future and no idea of how to get out of this rut and probably never will escape it and might just wind up sucking on a gun on you knowing this is this is the world we live in today and I think part of that world is because we have been fed this line of horseshit that you're supposed to seat comfort and I don't think you are I think you're supposed to seek lessons new supposed to see difficult tasks and and that end in accomplishments in through those things and through doing things are hard to do if it was just a fucking 90 minute hot yoga class I do a 90 minute yoga class when I doze last 20 minutes I do not want to be there man and I definitely don't want to give 100% And I can cheat how can I could be kind of half-ass it I can I can but if I don't and I get through it when that time is up and the lady says Namaste and everybody gets off my fuck man I made it you know I lost 15 pounds my fucking yoga mat is drenched apply like

<timemark seconds="5435" />

 literally ring it out fill up a jug up with water but through that struggle I will now have a better day and I better fucking do it again tomorrow or do something else because if I just think will tomorrow I'm just going to coast and eat Twinkies and watch TV hello sadness my old friend hello depression because we are not doing anything you feel like shit and that's just a part of being a human being and we can pretend we're something other than what we really are and we can pretend on me man I'm just cool just chilling doing nothing bullshit you're fucking human you're human being your you evolve from the fucking hundred thousands of years of hunters and gatherers and people that were struggling those were human reward systems are carved deeply into your DNA if you don't respect that if you don't respect the mechanism of happiness and fulfillment and what you really need to do in order to feel satisfied in life camaraderie love family friendship struggle testing yourself learning

<timemark seconds="5495" />

 all those things are imperative they're all giant part of being a person I love it that was amazing and I am thinking in my head in my checking those boxes as you're talking and then my living my life like that you know and yeah I agree with you sounds like you are I am yeah I know I feel like I have absolutely and I'm acting like you know as I'm listening to talk about that I'm literally going to like the last 10 years of my life you know and when I live with David when I went on the Mazda all these things they're all about getting an edge in doing what you said you know in it is it's I think it's like part of Being Human makes me feel most the most alive to you know like that just makes me feel alive you know and also like little improvements over things that's why I doing difficult things is good with her it's running so I give your running and you run you could run 2 miles and then one day you get it up to 3

<timemark seconds="5554" />

 psych fuck I know when I struggled with two now I can do for little Improvement you know when you really see that in yoga class and in particular for me because I'm not good at it you know so when I do a yoga class and I can hold a pose until the night your hold these pose for a minute if you could stand on one foot grabbing your other foot lift it above your head keep your arm straight your balance in your foots on Fire chords and gate but if you can get to the point where they say stop you've you feel like wow I didn't used to be able to do that I used to be able to hold it for 10 seconds and I'll fall down and then I have to start all over again start from scratch these little improvements will you feel yourself getting a little better at something where is jujitsu or anything else little improvements I think or what life is all about and I think also there are there a tool to feed the mind cuz I really believe the mind needs these will lessen the Mind need these little

<timemark seconds="5615" />

 these little tasks and if you do your brain doesn't get that I think it after fees and it gets depressed and it's like it's like I think that's half of what a lot of people sadness is is this lack of stimulation and reward lack of these Peaks and valleys in this again this bullshit idea that we're constantly fed that you should be comfortable so true I mean went when guys live with me his rule is we had to do something everyday that sucked that was his

<timemark seconds="5646" />

 every day sucked tell me that we could do that 5 times a day that we know now I mean I remember one day what was the first thing we did was he came in and he

<timemark seconds="5663" />

 you want to see me pull up so I could do so we can map out the monthly live with me for a month and I went to the pull up bar and I got like maybe 8 pull-ups which is an exaggeration of how you like flip-flops for listening and then you should I wait 30 seconds going through it again and I went up on the pull up bar and I did maybe like 3 or 4 should I wait 30 seconds I want to do it again at got up on the pull up bar and I did maybe like one Kipping you not getting the damn chin Over the Bar barely I drop down I was all jacked up and I said what's what's next you said but what's next is we're not leaving here to do a hundred more we're not leaving the gym so you do a hundred more now like right now right now so you when I'm done 7 I did like pirate 7:10 and I was like man God that's impossible and he said you know I already I already know what your biggest problem is he's like the limitations you put it on yourself are self-imposed the fuck back on the bar

<timemark seconds="5721" />

 and neither Rodger that man and I got up on the bar and I over over the course of an hour or two I did them and that started our journey of like you're about to go in a place where you've never been motherfucker you know and he. We went I remember one day I was sitting on the couch and in Connecticut where I was living at the time and on the Ticker on the on the TV the emergency broadcast system came up stay inside freezing rain icy conditions high winds stay inside like beeping stay inside and guys like this is amazing mouth go for a run

<timemark seconds="5758" />

 and I'm like they're telling us the exact opposite minute they're broadcasting to the whole Community to stay inside so we go for a 10 mile run in the blizzard we come home and I live on a lake and kids are playing hockey on the lake so we go down and he takes his hand he moves all the snow off the ice and gets a boulder and he breaks the ice a little hole in the ice with the Boulder and then he takes his hand he makes a little bit bigger and then he jumps in and then he points at me and it takes his finger in his singles for me to jump in

<timemark seconds="5790" />

 I'm not going in the freezing cold water cuz my mother told me as a kid in Long Island don't go anywhere near the Frozen waterfall in you have like a minute you know he's bathing in it so of course I go in and he looks like he's like man you got about him about fourth 2 2 2 2 4 minutes to get hypothermia we just went on a run we got to get you out of a lake and I go to get out of here she can't get out he goes if your skin touches the ice it's going to stick to the ice like the kid in Christmas story is tongue that sticks to the pole you know so he put my shoes back on my hands and kicks my ass up and puts my sock put my socks on whatever night bear crawl out of the ice and I run up and I see my wife looking out the window as I'm running into the house so we come in she says to Goggins you know like what's the medical benefit of jumping into frozen lake and he said to wear this no medical benefits like this what your husband signed up for you know it's like I want to see how far he's going to go to get to his goals

<timemark seconds="5849" />

 and I was like fuck this is going to be some 32 hits you do a consistency analysis like

<timemark seconds="5862" />

 I was just like it was just a little late she went everywhere I went to Shadow me for 30 day went every business meeting we flew together he live there let me know if my wife and I did like what the fuck did I sign up for this is back in 2010 so this is you know yes I did I was in the book came out 2 years ago yeah I waited 5 years I didn't I didn't you know it's expected to ever be a book it was just like you know at all there was no book being discussed I kept a little blog about it you know so why'd you do it

<timemark seconds="5897" />

 I just felt like there was so much in it there's so many lessons and it was funny fish out of water like he's coming to our house my wife own Spanx I mean like the door by the back of this shit was crazy and I just thought there were a lot of lessons that could be learned through it and took a shot at it Jesus Christ he's a maniac when he did the podcast I got here he showed up super early and when I got here he was already with his shirt off doing chin-ups I was like I walked into the back where the gym is and he's he's never look at this motherfucker amazing from you put yourself in a position for the Nuggets to appear and they don't 3 radical positions like I'm going to go get guy again but you put yourself out there like you were saying and you

<timemark seconds="5958" />

 life with those lessons find you and then you see unmotivated and lazy and you know talked openly about the first time you ran like he quit he was supposed to and I ran about three-quarters of a mile I think you said and quit and was exhausted and it's just drinking milk shakes and all fucked up and somehow or another decided he's not going to be that guy anymore and went a hundred eighty degrees the I came as intensely motivated Iron Man yeah yeah I was at the race I saw him at the Raceway broke all the bones in his feet you know I saw him I was at the tide participated in that race the first time I saw on time Adam and on a 2007 and

<timemark seconds="6008" />

<timemark seconds="6026" />

 it sounds like a lot of time so and I watched him wait till I was he bodybuilding at the time he was just Highway 267 deadlifting at maybe maybe even more so was this the one where he ran 24 hours all around the rich and just to show that he could run a hundred miles yet and they want to see himself yeah I told me about that I didn't know you broke all the bones in his feet broke some bones yeah he didn't even tell me about that then he ran a marathon a month later

 that would be hard but exciting where is the month thing seems like the Drone of it all would just get to you yeah and I can go back to my room and my surroundings in the Hmong thing I was like in their world forever forever and they live in the same way that you did they have a little Sal's well yeah by accident see their rooms but yeah from what I understand even smaller than when I was in smaller smaller than the stable my room is about the size of the state of the weather for smaller from what I understand you look up start all over again drone drone the four miles every 40 minutes what are four miles every four hours that sounds way better

<timemark seconds="6548" />

 that sounds crazy in that time but yeah how'd you end it how did the end of 30 days I left me a note on a Post-It thanks that's it that's it Jesus that's intense. Thanks

<timemark seconds="6566" />

 Jesus Christ my goodbyes are like long hugs changing exchanging shiftplanning thanks that would be an incredible service like if he wanted to do that just go to like billionaires and just say you have to do what I tell you to do for a month

<timemark seconds="6589" />

 not a lot of people would do that I'm sure just charge charge some fucking stupid amount of money

<timemark seconds="6596" />

 and have him live with you for a month you know that's hard and anybody personality-wise overtime having roommates it's hot you know what I mean tomorrow yeah and it's hard to have a wake you up every day every day he woke you up, tap me on the shoulder time to get up let's do with my wife right next to me Jesus Christ

<timemark seconds="6621" />

 it wasn't Pappas time to do this

<timemark seconds="6625" />

 what does it say

<timemark seconds="6628" />

 at least he was courteous Whispering it said didn't wake your wife up was your wife like what in the fuck you doing she loved them but was she do you like what in the fuck are you doing did you add your fucking mind wow she said you're crazy but 30 days later you must have been sick shape ridiculous Shake

<timemark seconds="6651" />

 no ridiculous when he left at 8 do I need for 6 weeks just to catch up and do anything for 6 weeks cuz I couldn't keep the intensity up I just got couldn't do it I run a hundred miles a python the internet's paddle races at them all the shit I couldn't do it wow I was just like why you know

<timemark seconds="6675" />

 it was wild damn I look back on that stuff man it's looks like I still so lucky to have had the opportunity you know what I mean like I said you're around that you're around the best dog trainers you're around you know and I get to live with it to my wife's an amazing entrepreneur I get to live with greatness you know and just you go around these things and it's just that these people it's just the stuff that you can learn if you allow yourself you know to listen I'm not a great listener I'm learning to be a good listener cuz even like you were giving that little my login you going through it I was like yes and that shit is resonating with me on a high-level you put yourself in the position and then you have to do you have to be able to extract it and apply it

<timemark seconds="6722" />

 yeah and exactly what I was saying is what you got out of Goggins you around greatness you around a man who just does not accept mediocrity and does not accept shity effort he wants everything your body can do and through doing that you just get something more out of your mind to get something more out of your life

<timemark seconds="6745" />

 did those hard days
