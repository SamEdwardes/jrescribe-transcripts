<timemark seconds="494" />

omniscience is what we aspire to maximum level of awareness on all fronts out of here if you're a welder a podcast for a guitar player rub butcher right maximum efficiency being the best you can be clear mind clear conscience true north compass in the world of archery because it does consume you in here I am 70 years clean and sober because I'm currently and forever consumed with the mystical Flight of the air which is the origins of Zen the Japanese religion of not shooting an arrow not being an arrow but being the path of your life and if you use the gift from God to the ultimate application of efficiency and effectiveness

<timemark seconds="544" />

you can put that fucking Arrow right

<timemark seconds="552" />

why we wanted to end the baggage that all humans have to deal with and it's most painfully manifested in the pursuit of archery is too many minds think about if you got to think about playing Wang Dang Sweet Poontang you ain't going to play it it better just be you and unleash and with an arrow because you want to let that are I need to put that all down there in that bullseye on that pump station or that crease of the Buffalo and so you wanted to go because that's what you're here for is to let the air go so you gotta tell yourself you can't let the arrow call

<timemark seconds="594" />

get shoot somebody else throughout your life that don't know too many mines subconscious physics of spirituality in Grain deep within your Origins and Aboriginal ancestry

<timemark seconds="608" />

emeritus

<timemark seconds="615" />

if ever there was an aim small Miss small Perfection it's archery and let me I don't mean to monologue here don't miss us so much of my life I know no matter what you do and I've done this since the 60s when the hippies were trying to get me stoned I'm going to stop what you want to do what you want to do is get a bow and arrow if you want to do is escape what you're trying to escape the pressures to pressures but those pressures you be the source of pressure not the receiver of pressure and my dad raised me my dad was a drill sergeant God bless that son-of-a-bitch discipline discipline discipline discipline especially the archery range and so I learned archery and when I'm playing guitar and I'm playing all this outrageous Chuck Berry Bo Diddley Little Richard stuff and everybody's getting high and drunk and Derek really great musicians and more High anymore. They got

<timemark seconds="668" />

they became less great musicians until the point where the morning for musicians anymore and so I would Escape that 11 12 and there was no hippies was beatniks and I get back to my little house in Redford on the Rouge River in Detroit I get that little bow and arrow and I go down to skunk Hollow and it River Rat and even is a stupid mushy brain idiot child I was able to

<timemark seconds="699" />

little Longbow no returns yet

<timemark seconds="705" />

I could shoot a rat in the eye because I had no baggage yet I haven't developed any social baggage and that has served me so the many mines no mind right at the baggage shoot arrows when you start talking about this they don't really understand what you're saying but for a lot of people this is a very misunderstood subject right it did it did this is a meditation there's a meditation involved in the absolute matter takes you out of body the Ultimate Aero like the ultimate guitar lick I suspect a comedian on stage which I qualify you can't be thinking of your routine is kind of flow I mean I was in the presence of Sam Kinison for 50-60 spontaneous performances and Robin Williams at The Comedy Store and little and Richard Pryor you keep member I won't mention a moment ago I've been on the mountain top with Bill strapping

<timemark seconds="765" />

Broncos and Parnelli Jones. Me the race I played bass for Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley I mean I married mrs. Nugent I mean I've been to the peak of Peaks available to mankind I hunted with Fred fucking bear when did you do that I met him he was started the brand new archery shop in Grayling Michigan my dad was already a follower before I was born the people who he is dated powerful story he's like the Richard Pryor of archery

<timemark seconds="798" />

who is awesome so I'm already in the bows and arrows I don't know if I was just getting you know baptized by the Chuck Berry Bo Diddley electronic guitar orgy and in that late 40s early 50s it was a firestorm of defiance and Rebellion musically manifested but Roy Weatherby was going to be on the 30-30 which everybody use for deer hunting it was a good hundred yard and for real Marchman real Zen Markman could shoot a 30-30 200-plus yards weather open sights AR scope and marshman shipping sniper discipline was a powerful force in a hunting family and in all families every family I know we all shot every weekend pistol shotguns rifles 22 is hunting woodchucks in Fryeburg Pennsylvania with the Targetmaster Remington single shot bolt 22 22 short $0.25 a box at the dry goods store that my dad taught me to shoot him in the I am small Miss small breed

<timemark seconds="858" />

site acquisition you have a responsibility to kill that animal out right if you're going to utilize that precious gift of Flesh and fur body fluids and Bone you better kill him clean because you're a reasoning Predator you have a moral intellectual and spiritual obligation to kill your dinner humanely and cleanly duh and so that Marksmanship routine was developing with Ballistic Ted Nugent ballistically maximized Firepower and you know that has a ring to it maybe that's maybe that's what it could fight for Fred Bear Fred Bear was extending long-range Marksmanship in developing the the famous Weatherby Magnum with more powder more efficient burning powder better primers better design ballistic bullets that would cut are better and go flatter longer

<timemark seconds="918" />

projector in velocity deer or Bullseye in a hundred yards that takes a lot of trigger control and discipline but now Roy Weatherby was grating Weatherby Magnum 300 Weatherby Magnum shot a hundred 80 grain bullets 32 3400 feet a second which is unheard of and so you could aim small Miss small and if you really got that really intricate meticulous triggered smoothness you could shoot thousand yards once you learn the trajectory of your gun however 1911

<timemark seconds="955" />

the last of the Yanni Indians is she was discovered in Oroville completely remember all this in Oroville California Northern California and there was a bounty on Indians back then you can shoot a man Indian and get 25 bucks you should yep they had bounties on them and instead of shooting this yonnie does last Indian they called the local sheriff inmate took ishi in the custody and they called some scientists and Helen geologists from California University by the name of Saxton Pope in Saxton Pope came and study sheet as a is a Aboriginal last attempt of Pope and young that's right and then he contacted his buddy are young who also studied in that genre and they discovered he she and they were fascinated by his stealthy awareness of the Wilderness in his

<timemark seconds="1015" />

archery control with his funny little style shooting the ball with his thumb and getting close and doing ice cold River bathing before the hunt Clemens himself to be worthy of the Beast so Fred Bear witness the film that Pope and young eventually made of them becoming consumed with the mystical play The Arrow now this was in the twenties and thirties and they put a newsreel outman all over the country and show this news real hunting with a bow and arrow by Saxon pulvinar young grizzly bears in Yosemite and going to Africa fill in lines for arrows they weren't really as good as he sheep so they swing a lot of these animals pretty relaxed almost came because they've never been hunted like that before hand so Fred Bear come from Pennsylvania around that time I'm to work at the phone company building cabinets for the new radio they just invented in the wood dashboards for the Ford Motor Company and he was also making bows

<timemark seconds="1075" />

handmade you would in or Osage orange bows in his little archery shop with nails Graham Lee Nails grumpy one of the greatest Bowlers of all time so my dad got the archery bug because Fred defied the trend of easier hunting

<timemark seconds="1095" />

easier long-range that have to be very stealthy shoot a deer at 500 yards they don't even know you there I have to do would be a discipline Marchman which is a great accomplishment and it was a new challenge for long-range ballistic capabilities open young and a handful fredbear nose grumley went and saw this news real of These Guys these jerseys professors hunting all of the world with these handmade bows and Fred was already into it and he was I'll be damned if I didn't realize you could do that and so now people after seeing the pope and young newest real started asking Fred to make bows and it spread so we started the Bear Archery company late 20s or early 30s any move to Grayling up in the northern part of Michigan with the Wilderness was in the yard cut down all the trees so there was this new growth of Ideal wildlife habitat that many animals can live in an old world

<timemark seconds="1155" />

Fowler tools but you need low-level Escape sanctuary in brows that the animals can access and so Fred was now promoting archery in michigan won all the National Field archery Championship championships along with Ann Marston it's awesome it's all my dad was a follower because he come back from World War II and he needed that escaped he needed that cleansing to get away from that horror which is why they never talked about it and so we go up north every year October 1st and I have my little bow and arrow with a suction cups and I shoot stuffed animals off the couch but my dad would walk the woods with his real bow and we stopped at this little brick Shack that said Bear Archery and I had no idea and so I was already in the boys mirror shooting all the time I was obsessed I was on. River everyday no baseball no football no hockey what was Nirvana's Maryland Critters Songbird World slam

<timemark seconds="1215" />

am I was eight and in so now I'm eating this tall lanky gentleman named Fred Bear and didn't register with me until I started seeing them on the cover of true magazine and sporting magazines in in Life Magazine with a grizzly bear and elephant in the tiger and a lion in the news Rios and I'm going I'm shooting River Rats which is so thrilling I can't even describe it and here's this long lanky tall lanky guy that was building bows in The Rustic shop in northern Michigan on my way to my favorite thing in life October 1st opening day of archery season as a 6 7 8 year old boy and we have chocolate milk and cherry pie with this fredbear guy now it's registering this is the Chuck Berry of Bonnie this is it this is the guy so I became enamored with him and he was kind to me and it show me stuff but I got to hang out with him as I grew by the time I was 16 we moved Chicago's my dad got transferred but I got to visit with Fred Bear at least every other October never Hunted

<timemark seconds="1275" />

and I'm now I started Amboy Dukes I'd already had a great band won the battle of the bands in Michigan with the Lord we opened up for The Supremes in the Beau brummels at Cobo Hall wow playing like a madman graduated in 67 went back to Michigan that 2 years later and immediately went up the great and we're now there's this huge Cathedral Bear Archery in fredbear is like that dude is like the Sporting Goods because he taught the long-range Marksman that there's an intimacy

<timemark seconds="1308" />

there's a a better learning process in more important lesson to not kill the animal but you understand your relationship with the animal and to try to use those god-given gifts I mention the moment to go to penetrate the otherwise impenetrable defense system of game cuz they are sneaky it Loose crafty God made them to get away from guitar players with sharp sticks and so this caught on because people going you know I kill my dear every year with my 33rd and now with the 30 out 6 Android weather long range

<timemark seconds="1347" />

I wonder if I'm a badass enough to get close to a deer with a bow and arrow so it caught on like wildfire and they made the first red got the first legal season in Michigan to Allegan state parks on November 1st 1947 where George Nichols my buddy got the first legal buck in Michigan with a bow and arrow on that morning so I knew these these these would like you were I was at the Concord Bridge or treat and so shredded embraced me as real suspicious of the long-haired hippie looking you know rock and Maniac Motor City madman but I'll just friends with no no he's not into drugs he's in fact he's anti-drug and he's always promoting our trash on my bow and arrow on stage forever and shoot flaming arrows illegal and he was a felony a big turkey vulture I had stuff it look great back let you know and I shoot that fucker off this app's at night people didn't know where the shitter go blind this is wild man screen

<timemark seconds="1407" />

make a call to blow up past the insanity of the Fear Factor of rock and roll and he finally admitted to me said every Sporting Good Show I go to Ted all the young people anybody under 30 all they want to know is if I know Ted Nugent because that was the first time they ever saw a bow and arrow and they read my you my interviews about the the spirit the cleansing of escaping the insanity of whatever your job description might be mine being maniacal rock and roll I need to shut the fuck up

<timemark seconds="1452" />

take a deep breath get my bow and arrow let my guitars breed head back to the woods

<timemark seconds="1463" />

and live and and remember who I am and what I'm here for and I never killed a deer I was little too uppity and we didn't know what we're doing back then you what do you think what do you mean I just I'm high energy so you're too high do I wasn't the stealthy at first and I learn to go around anything you instead of stepping over and to stay in the shadows so I knew the Maneuvers but after November it's hard to go from that to Total sounds

<timemark seconds="1509" />

stirred it I know yeah finally I mean I did buy you been sick a long time by the sixties I don't know about master you'll never Master it but I've mastered the transaction what do you say when people like that one of the arguments about hunting that people bring up is why would you use in a bow and arrow bow and arrows not as effective if you wanted to kill something you should use a gun his people that don't hunt that think that hunting should only be one thing and it should only be killing the animal from me where as I think that someone who hunts definitely kills the animal from me all that there's more there's more to the whole thing and never seen me expound on fun sport meet trophy you can't Hunt without having fun or you won't do it it's fun to challenge yourself it's fun to get up and I didn't have a problem with my ass if it wasn't fun none of us would do it I understand your your your take on it then kicks kiss your ass but

<timemark seconds="1565" />

you it means something to you it's not as simple as like fuck you this is just how I'm going to do it as being the greatest basketball 3-point shooter is net fun must be discipline he will but it's it's always fun it's because it's invigorating right and the bow hunting is more invigorate because it's so difficult soda borderline fun sport why don't think sport hunting is good you shouldn't have sport how can you hunt without sport don't you think this is just too many of these words are poisoned there's like you know what I have on my wall my Northern Cab in your love you already are inclined to love me but now you're really going to your going for you to fuck me right here or at least that is where some of my buddies heading out so I'm the wall of my cabin in northern Michigan is my first kill November 15th 1969 my dance 360 tell him I said

<timemark seconds="1625" />

button buck deer the story and I took it to the taxidermist and I said I want this he said which is illegal deer with a doe tag and I had that beer and I I said it's a buck feel he have to feel on that make sure it is a buck is it such a little guy and it's a legal deer and it's a delicious deer there dear the year is the van that's why we have this planting season in the fall because now they're independent they're not there been weaned their independent animals in fact about the button box are there ass is getting kicked by their mother to throw him out of the her to get the hell away from more reading which is what I do and it's so I have that button buck mounted who's going to tell me that's not a trophy the experiences the memories the clothes the bullets the day the sun rise the crows the sandhill cranes the birds the movement the anticipation

<timemark seconds="1683" />

can I cut back straps I had fun ultimate discipline challenge sport ultimate meat ultimate protein the purest most organic before it was even hip and if you could I dare you to tell me that button buck is not a trophy I got I have woodchucks mounted with my grandson life I have I have squirrels mice always a trophy Mountain squirrel on the squirrels are in stuff it's a it's a squirrel that came out on a limb ethic in the cabin

<timemark seconds="1726" />

the longest rock and Brock my son out he was first wood duck that he got very with much effort and we have that wood duck mounted there's a there's a love affair with our instinctual stewardship duties to the wildlife to harvest a surplus to make room for next Spring's productivity because there's going to be more animals but there's not going to be more habitats and sustained yield successful Wildlife Management model that is so perfect it defies criticism unless you're a lying sack of shit have you ever had to have a reasonable conversation with some of those anti-hunting give really sad that yeah apps to the man and woman I mean adamant vagin until I explained to him well today and I like that vegan but I can't even pronounce it much less about right so stupid by the way my son Rocco who I love Beyond description yep vegan know

<timemark seconds="1786" />

looks like he needs to eat more when he's asleep I try to shove up back strap up his ass but he's got more muscles than I do my point is is that I'm glad I heard you become vegan is a great Hunter he doesn't like to hunt anymore he's decided not to he's are killed great dear great Hogs I've seen them on your TV show. Yeah he's a great hunter but he just said he decided he does not want to take part in the Harvest I respect it completely but if you if you really want to kill the most things

<timemark seconds="1823" />

be vegan because the farmers who protect your beans kill everything I kill one animal borero in order to grow tofu you have to kill every ground squirrel every Bowl every true every snake every Turtle every frog every bird every rabbit anything that gets in that being filled I'm either going to plow and dismembered which is why the crows in the in the seagulls follow the the survived my first Slaughter I'm going to come in with man santwan poison the shit out of everything so you can have a tofu salad and not be responsible for any death fuck you what's a really good point and it's a lot that a lot of people ignore because it's uncomfortable life full of uncomforting that you shouldn't be uncomfortable to kill game to feed mankind is

<timemark seconds="1880" />

perfect to kill cows and pigs to feed mankind it's the system is off in less than perfect but until someone comes up with a better system I salute and genuflect at the altar of farmers and ranchers and people who kill animals to sustain my fellow man I agree with you I think you and I would probably both disagree with factory farming when you see animals stuck in the cages but we have come up with a better system is still a lot of beer and I I feed more people than any

<timemark seconds="1911" />

any hundred ever guy kill so many much game of yours I have to I have to find out how your Sharpshooters I I kill the animals on my beautiful swamp in Michigan of my Texas property that have to die they have to get out of there to make room for the next year response so I buy soup kitchens homeless you I literally give tons and and I'm a sweetheart but I'm not an idiot I keep the back straps but I give ton of venison stew soup kitchen homeless shelters in veterans you make jerky and send it over to the troops overseas I mean I have to adjust my halo just to get in the room so what I do is literally perfect well just the problem is what you do everybody can't do like everybody's not going to have your kind of way more people could do more people couldn't Well you aren't you definitely I know the hunters for the hungry distribute 250 million Joe 250 million meals every year of venison in there are people that would ban that

<timemark seconds="1971" />

shame on you well I just think there's a lot of films and a lot of documentaries that portray veganism is being is perfect way of living that doesn't have any death or any habitat loss associated with it and then they look at the extreme of meat eating which is due with the worst aspects of it factory farming somebody's disgusting pig farms chicken to Sandusky horrible horrifying the upgrade goes on because more alarms have been sounded not by Pay It or Not by the humane society United States they're just scam artist by people who are coming to realize that we do not only have a responsibility to kill Critters to feed mankind but it can be done in an environmentally beneficial way I mean if you watch my great late friend Anthony Bourdain on his shows and Andrew Zimmern on the Travel Channel you watch their shows and the emphasis on environmentally friendly productivity more and more organic

<timemark seconds="2031" />

farming more and more conscientious waste dispersal weather Encino pig guts and a weed we utilize those are in Las Vegas to get all this wasted food and they feed the pig so it's good food going into work taste better so there is upgrade taking place in here's the ultimate inescapable fact of upgrade environmentalism when I was growing up Joe Lake Erie wood Catch Fire because of the pollution

<timemark seconds="2058" />

it was an environmentalist are Greenies that sound of the alarm it was the duck Hunters that said you're pollutant this area so bad there's no ducks there's no wild salary if there's no walleyes there's no fish there's no muskrats for the Trappers Hunters fishermen and Trappers have sound of the alarm more often than not about environmental your responsibility and now Lake Erie wood spontaneously combust when I was growing up he is now the number one walleye in smallmouth bass fishery in the world and it's still we're still producing still got the Industrial Revolution going on there but conscientious higher responsible level of awareness is spreading like wildfire it across the country and I believe that there's no Mutual exclusivity whatsoever to productivity and environmental responsibility I believe that they both benefit each other and I've got so many on unlimited examples where that worked from farms it mean

<timemark seconds="2115" />

people who live downwind of a pink pig farm are going to be the biggest squawkers rightly so yeah I see a lot of upgrade going on more organic more conscientious less ways it's not it's not as regular operating procedures that should be but I see upgrade I see I think you're right and I think that the the thought process behind all these people are upset about factory farming people even that go vegan the thought process behind it is in the right place I just think there's a lot of misguided energy there because they don't really understand where the food is coming from they don't understand large-scale agriculture to understand when you and a lot of large-scale Agriculture is to grow food to feed animals that the essential yeah but it's also we also a lot of grain a piece that displaces thousands and thousands of Acres of animal shirt and the the process is not a clean process it's not clean and in terms of there's no death

<timemark seconds="2175" />

there's no harm in that it's cruelty-free this crazy it's just not as if you could possibly go through a day without having blood on your hands do you drive on the highway there's any of your susteren's come on the highway because billions of animals are slaughtered on the highways everyday and if you are on planet Earth part of that blood is on your head you gotta who doesn't know this who's not willing to admit this but I can't I see an upgrade in level of awareness and responsibilities put the discharge began in the hunting fishing and trapping Community where is where is quality Are soil and water come from I'll go ahead and answer that wildlife habitat of the people that are out there everyday that you recognize it to get death threats because I'm murder innocent animals

<timemark seconds="2235" />

what are talking now they're just haters there just bit of that show 2018 do you not acknowledge barbecue in 2018 do you not ignores a few dead turkeys on Thanksgiving what are you going to be brain-dead I think they're so consumed with hate that they fight ignorance is acceptable I make her up when I go to the Indy 500 I couldn't tuna cogsworth I don't I'm ignorant ignorance is acceptable because you can remedy it with knowledge in and research stupidity is when you guard your ignorance if you think that were murdering innocent animals to feed our families with the purest protein available to mankind balancing the herds with more deer or elk more bison more turkeys more waterfowl more cougars more bears than ever in recorded history except for the Bison but we're way back we have as many Bisons we can sustain the North America lot of the Native American tribes are desperate to get more harvested

<timemark seconds="2295" />

efficient and responsible manner so Wildlife is thriving because Hunters implemented regulations for sustained yield how many ducks can we kill how many will be reproduced where is their habitat was the reproduction we must safeguard that Delta waterfowl Ducks Unlimited but see this information is universally available but the fake news Academia Hollywood and half of our government is stone-cold obsessed with political correctness in denial so I do what I do and our spirit of the wild Shield been number one is 29 years now while I'm getting old because we say it like it is we don't play around fun sport me trophy sacred Beast prayer for the Wild Things resource stewardship conservation wise use walk the wild ground before you comment on the wild ground yeah duh what this is what I'm talking about but they found the guy

<timemark seconds="2355" />

East River study she okay I will write it down what does shi you have to learn else I'm going to send you a bunch of stuff I'm going to get your contacts and I'm going to send you stuff it will expand your horizons like you didn't know was available the history of modern bow hunting at the hands of fredbear and end in Saxton Pope and Young and the families that wanted to get closer to game not necessary Kilgore 90% of the time you don't feel squats with a bow and arrow but when you do it's because you dedicate yourself to higher reasoning level Predator awareness and you put your gift from God to the maximum efficiency and again that's welding and carpentry but you're in a kill something you better kill it clean and being human and failing overall to be perfect you can be perfect

<timemark seconds="2415" />

put that are when you learned read the wild signals that they can the attitude and the the the bird indicators from the deers, you use the the light the win the camo stealthy movements silence and learned time that shot my average Deer dies in 5 seconds

<timemark seconds="2438" />

the the top of the heart's taken off both lungs were penetrated that deer falls asleep on his feet and there's never been a beef steak ever had it so good they also there's a connection to what you're doing that's different than almost any of the connection to food me and the only thing that's reasonably close and it's pretty far off is when you grow it yourself so if you grow your own vegetables you got a connection that food but it's not the same connections you get no because you was going to send an arrow through an animal you know how difficult it is when you pull it off as his powerful connection between you and that animal Merlin you eat you earn it and when you eat it you feel that you earned it I'd tell enjoy out of it when Anthony Bourdain came to my place he was still a little squeamish with Killers. Even though you eat dead stuff at every show and got his paycheck for meeting Deb stuff

<timemark seconds="2491" />

I hunt with the great man and we talked about it and I shared my knowledge with him I'm not I don't have an opinion it's an animal it's dead you either Revere it or you don't you need to utilize with respect or you pretend you didn't have anything to do with it it's dead you're eating it you should have been closer to the system and the hunters fishermen and Travers this country still carry on the definitive physics of spirituality that the native an Aboriginal peoples called the great spirit hence the spirit of the wild the prayer for the wild things are the cities right yeah but I mean you got lucky in that your father was interested in bowhunting and that it gave him an escape which by the way it gives a lot of veterans today a lot of veterans

<timemark seconds="2551" />

good friends of mine are finding the Ulta great relief in bowhunting as a discipline after combat light do to a guy that should many campfires with those guys last night great transition for them it's consuming fredbear use of the phrase coined the phrase and I use it all the time it cleanses the soul when you leave the paper when I leave the pavement and I make that transition from Modern Concrete Jungle hand to hand combat City I cuz that's where my rock and roll career is the ultimate and then you take that deep breath you're literally go back to the year one I know there's a highway near by and I know I can hear trucks off in the distance in the train whistle which is kind of to delete a note to itself but when I get in my swamp in Michigan or Mike Woodson Texas

<timemark seconds="2606" />

the quote Jimi Hendrix ain't no life know where I am

<timemark seconds="2611" />

the aborigine it's me my resources and the Beast and it's a it's a religious experience it's the spirit natives call it the great spirit they have to consider the Buffalo their brother and it is so consuming that I don't care what kind of stress you could be going for the ugliest divorce in the world and I have you could be fighting against people who don't think that America should be first and you don't need secure borders and you don't need to earn your own way you're able body but you must somebody else's income it just crazy shit and all the sudden I get out there and I'm telling you Joe

<timemark seconds="2652" />

hits

<timemark seconds="2654" />

perfect I'm so I'm literally intoxicated I'm I'm drunk I'm stoned trying to pick up all the signals and I do I do pretty good job I've learned over the years cuz I need that so much to play my music like I play it that it cleanses myself and I've I've been contacted since the sixties with vets who have gone through just absolute

<timemark seconds="2681" />

torture in their military careers and when I get them at a campfire when we go out and shit before the sun comes up

<timemark seconds="2692" />

I can't tell you how many times I've cried cuz it's it's good again

<timemark seconds="2697" />

it's a great morning I didn't have any stress forgot all about that bullshit when I thought I heard the deer then when I saw that dear

<timemark seconds="2707" />

perfect so you've expressed and I thank you for that because you're new to this Sport and for you to be an advocate and to articulate you learn because you're already a mature man when you better did I was a dirtball mushy brain kid but thank God I learned about that spirit I learned about the discipline I learned about stewardship callings and responsibilities pounded by my dad God bless him in my brother is my sister we all are happy healthy successful hard work and funny cocky loving giving people because of that discipline that revolved around my family hunting seasons what discipline is one of the big world that said that there was one of the really important aspects of it because I recognize the importance of discipline and always have pretty much my whole life is a martial artist especially yeah so I came into

<timemark seconds="2767" />

this is a different thing this is not what everybody thinks it is this is this is a spiritual experience because you were around the Masters Cameron Hanes yeah you had John Dudley on here he's a Michigan boy yeah yeah that sucks that they were good mattress for you I got lucky you got past the mistaken yet irresponsibly and dishonestly promoted aspect of the drunken hillbilly sign shooter Hunter stereotype is so ridiculous mean my friends like guys like Cameron Hanes so God damn ultramarathon Runner me like that runs 240 miles in a week and then you know is on the mountains all fall long at mofo I'm glad he doesn't play guitar music Bad motherfuker across the board said he's he's an incredibly discipline guy Services his life is a band hitam he'll tell everybody all that stuff he does all the work now that's so he can be at his best in the mouth

<timemark seconds="2827" />

has a bowhunter sure that he considers his true spiritual call and I'm not bragging I'm just kind of Sharon celebration and I have been humbled and blessed Beyond description to share campfires with more Hunters than anybody you've ever met because I've been donating hunts for years I started my Sunrise Safari iguide hundreds of hunters every year I don't take them all out to their stand but we all get together at my Michigan Place have 24 in a weekend 22 weekend and it's a campfire get down with Uncle Ted playing guitar but we shoot our bows we shoot our guns we set things up lot of more newcomers I got on my spirit wild Ranch in Texas I guide in New Brunswick in Ontario for Kid Rock in the bow hunting yes I did there's a great story

<timemark seconds="2882" />

remember that discipline weird weird about you have that it's working on that

<timemark seconds="2888" />

Fred is a killer or she is a killer gorgeous gal but Audrey is a dangerous bull hunting woman I mean is always killing stuff she's addicted I get I get pics from her all the time and never from Bob that's hilarious that's awesome how to start sharing that stuff with your level of appreciation of fine ass women with a sharp stick this gap between my wife Jermaine and Audrey I'm telling you yeah the guys that you've hunted with

<timemark seconds="2920" />

you're talking about Greek human beings Men of Integrity and discipline and productivity and a drive to be in the asset, I misunderstood because of movies very rarely I get up and I was about to say I should have campfires with lots of newcomers because they see this rock and roll guy that they love the music and we share the appreciation for my American rhythm and blues rock and roll Jihad and so they want to try hunting and they come to my bio hunt with me or they make a donation for a military children's charity and they've never had and I tell him what to buy and they show up and it's Matty bumppo man you know who Natty bumppo for Cooper he was at character in his eye last of Mohicans the new Hunter Natty bumppo just like a novice of rookie I've never met anybody

<timemark seconds="2980" />

at any of my campfires

<timemark seconds="2983" />

that wasn't honest

<timemark seconds="2986" />

it wasn't friendly wasn't successful to some degree whether it's a teacher on a teacher salary successful there a teacher that's successful

<timemark seconds="2997" />

who care deeply about the wildlife in the wild rounds

<timemark seconds="3003" />

so when you hear about loud and drunk and bomb shooting everything but nobody spend more time with more hunters and I have I've never seen that well I have some of them free stuff but fuck kids I know but that's not the priesthood I hope so there's always going to be a permanent dipshit demonic Behavior by our fellow man somewhere somehow but it is so rare in the hunting world that is all I do 7 months of years hunt well I haven't had as much as you but I've been around a lot of great people great people and it goes right back to Fred Bear which is the start off of our dialogue here great man we hunted until 1987 together in October and he was on oxygen that he passed away of you ever heard the song Yeah by bear song that that song happened with a life of its own because of my love and admiration for the Man and the Sea represent

<timemark seconds="3063" />

there is a torch further than everyone but it's those people are so important that time where there was no indication to try have to animal rights thing hadn't really started meaningfully yet political correctness wasn't even cleaned with no fake news there was the beginning of the attack on hunting from you know ignorant acidified people that somehow believe that their food didn't die or they're not responsible for any of that and so they would your play the holier-than-thou dishonesty move by attacking those of us that actually took part in the process of feeding their families and Fred was such a gentleman and he was so clever and he so efficiently promoted The Challenge and the intimacy of man and wild connection that I he will live in infamy everybody in the hunting world knows that he was a force to reckon with and he's always there in as the song says in the Wind

<timemark seconds="3123" />

he's still alive and its power from a lot of people know him because of you have learned about Fred from me then from the archery industry this this conversation you've been having this conversation about hunting forever when I've heard a lot of these things you're saying today before from you is this the ever get tired but I only miss evangelist I love it so much and the other side is so dishonest that I know I make inroads you order my Facebook I'm ignorant does not going to be new grounding know what this venison is good food right but they don't think of it that way

<timemark seconds="3171" />

2007 examples since the 60s were people thought I was animals that can shoot back

<timemark seconds="3183" />

play music at you but you left trigger fingers you drink so I have taken this out of that you noticed I smile throughout that whole thing I don't get angry so I know that by continuing to promote in the absence of any education Early Education System facts the opposite animal-rights gets more time in our education system are anti education the media lion sons of Hollywood goofy half of the government out to lunch so you guys like you and me that know the truth we should never give up because there is a scourge of political correctness in dishonesty that's what political correctness is its denial and dishonesty and I know we're making inroads you should see the bombardment I got a big hunter now he's really a fighter he speak cleverly speaks accurately in and passionately about it but Hallelujah there's a bunch of us out there with the Advent of the Outdoor Channel Sportsman's Channel The Pursuit Network more more people are getting

<timemark seconds="3242" />

new wind of what we're doing nothing a lot of it from the internet to monster communication our understand that there's more to it than they thought and if they're willing to just look a little bit further look a little bit further they realize I was specially Western hunting guys are running hills and they're dead they're they're backpacking with heavy weights on their back discipline for hours and hours every day just to build up your endurance hike out with meet these Western Hunters man that are going out at mofo as you go hunting elk in the packing them out by themselves over course of five days when I was 20 something I guess I must have been 28 my first Alaska trip 77 I was out there for two weeks and a soggy wet nasty cold 10th and I got a giant Caribou a great black bear in a big ol moose and boy humping them quarters in that that Tundra yeah I thought I was a Superman athletic amplifier

<timemark seconds="3302" />

jumping rock and roll sinew muscle-boy the real animal and that goes back to what you were said earlier that when you dine on that and you put that effort forth and you spent all those days skunked and wet and cold and nasty and join it what it was but there's also a pain in the ass you can't get wait to get back to some place for the wood burner but when you packed out yourself when you take that sacred flesh off that Grill before you even finish the first night slice

<timemark seconds="3342" />

all those memories and it just tastes better than it really does taste better but with that effort it is a spiritual moment that this think the native say you don't kill the animal you accept the gift if you put your heart and soul into your reasoning predator ship and that's always been my Mantra and my kids are all raised on venison at 3 just don't buy meat that's all we eat is the stuff we kill pheasants and quail and doves and Woodcock and growls and rabbits and squirrels and ducks and geese and golden mules and night in beavers and in Deer and elk and Antelope and bear and cougar the greatest food and what I'm 70 years old I'm a force to reckon with because of my discipline diet of the ultimate Rocket Fuel available on planet Earth

<timemark seconds="3401" />

think about you know the average person that's been eating the average American diet for 7 years by time you get there your age there deteriorating rapidly in the fruit toaster the chemicals the preservative oh my God hears to see if I'm an The Joe Rogan podcast please do my friends get rid of the goddamn sugar if you can't pronounce it on the package do not buy it do not feed your children high-fructose poisoning my God people get the poisons out of your blood refurbish lives good food is so simple by what catch a fish or buy a fish buy some fresh or grow some fresh vegetables put real butter and use the real fat don't take the skin off the chicken that's where all the good fat is that's where all the flavor is and

<timemark seconds="3461" />

real food while we can't afford that know you can't afford not to everything is just diet on it or no sugar is poison and it's not my opinion it's a chemical reality and when you when you died when you attempt to digest fructose and preservatives your body goes I don't recognize this bullshit we can process this and it turns into lover and here's a little update blubber is for sperm whales not people if you have to lift up slabs to dry off after the shower your diet sucks I saw you in an interview once a long time ago was before I started why I've been up I've done a bunch of I know you have but when I saw you I was like house cats much fucking energy remember thinking that might this guy so far. And then you started talking about your diet so it's hard but you said all I eat is venison and start going off. Backstrap and then I started thinking like what you think about

<timemark seconds="3521" />

the dark red meat of wild game for several years they can get a swan dive into it I got lucky Steven it took me with a mass on his show doesn't like me but he's my son ready for the Wacom and stack them because it would be much better if I just butchered them and slaughter them because semantics is so important the what the way you phrase things whack em and stack them it's fun jacking I got 12 bluegills that's a stack shut the fuk up well do you think people think that you were outrageous behavior somehow detrimental to the movement of acceptance stupid people do the people who come and join the sport because of my exuberance don't well I would say that God bless and God bless their masters of their craft

<timemark seconds="3581" />

I have caused more young people to become Hunters than all other forces in the world case closed because I'm having so much fucking fun they go hair bows and arrows

<timemark seconds="3597" />

the absolutely come to it because of the fun than the hear about the discipline to hear about the quality diet and they hear about the spiritual trophy weather antlers or not that has guided my passionate life and manifest itself in these killer songs and killer guitar licks and outrageous fire-breathing concert they go do that and so they speak in a bone arrow this year to get a shotgun to start hunts go to my Facebook I don't know if it's Millions but thousands and thousands of young people that would be inclined to be anti hun or no gun Halo Hunters because uncle Ted is having so much fun because I whack them and stack them congratulations of that the thing is that they don't get when when you hear your enthusiasm then they go okay well I haven't had this perspective before their perspective on Hunting that I've gotten before is that these are cruel assholes that go out there and shoot animals and they don't care and For Worse

<timemark seconds="3657" />

or Worse Joelle my critics and I won't mention any names but you know when they're on their hunting TV shows and not there so Altra cautious not to ruffle any feathers they come off like mr. Rogers with The Lawrence Welk song track and young people think your a fucking asshole if that's all you've got hit that boring I think I'll just smoke some dope and goes no cruising tonight which I know you like to smoke your dog for dope and that in now called dope in him go nuts, it's called though, but I got buddies and I'm not so sure step to that I just don't think that Comfortably Numb is the way to go in fact I have a source on I have one more better song she just called uncomfortably dumb is are you a father Yes you want your babysitter hi know how about your doctor know but I don't want I don't want my babysitter sleeping

<timemark seconds="3717" />

either you don't want to watch Sleeping I want them paying attention so that doesn't mean that you shouldn't get high ever just means you shouldn't get high when you're watching kids

<timemark seconds="3727" />

damn right yeah when you're flying my plane I'm going to be late I skipped my comedians it helps take steroids for Carmen Richard Pryor and Robin Williams and Sam Kinison go ahead and got motherfucker cuz I need to laugh till I shit it's hard to come up with that shit sober Potter very similar to the perceptions about this a lot of people in The Beauty Spot they abused alcohol DBZ people abused every sure doesn't mean you can't use it responsibly I agree unfortunately in my 60 years of pursuing the Chuck Berry soundtrack of ultra James Brown type music I have never seen anything

<timemark seconds="3784" />

but heartbreak throw rugs from the drug use I even knew Council by the way working with President Trump to legalize medical marijuana Nationwide we don't want you to know that and I'm all for that that's awesome I deal with a lot of terminally ill kids and there's nothing that's off-limits to take away that suffering I need to fight for that it's great for people that pull up see as well as kids Hub City autism I got my bag out in the truck some guys making water with cannabis oil with the CDB's and part of CBD and it says will help me relax after my Sonic bombast tortured jumping off all those naps I never knew I never heard the word meniscus till my doctor said I had them I have a tear on mine I just got a stem cell shots and it yesterday

<timemark seconds="3903" />

what is it 18 now 12 maybe so 12 years of pain it was more than that but up cuz I jumped off those fucking amplifiers oh my what kind of dirt bag was I somebody should have said you have meniscus you know what the lead singer for Tool right he blew his hip out from just stomping on the ground while you saying it because the music the music made me do it the music made him do it this music made Steve Tyler do when you get up there it is a world onto itself it is out of body is stream-of-consciousness it you got to be careful because you think you're

<timemark seconds="3948" />

Invincible Invincible on that stage with my way the movie Invincible to use Stranglehold best use of my song ever.

rock and roll guitarist and bow hunting for most people like a big stretch stretch it's like one of those different galaxies in the universe except for the most important elements I just disappear this upon the focus to create and I've been so blessed beyond words to have the greatest musicians at my side forever for Liberty 60 years right now I got Greg Smith on the bass guitar just a god of thunder Greg Smith the best like a funk brother in heat and Jason hartless 23 year old drummer from Detroit is just an absolute animal and every band from my Royal High boys in the 50s to the Lord's in the 60s and the Amboy Dukes and even the Damn Yankees with Tommy and Jack and Michael are you kidding me I'd had literally a list of musicians at my side from Tommy Aldridge and Tommy clufetos and make brown and drums and Indian Cliff Davies are you kidding me Denny carmassi I mean the best drummers

<timemark seconds="4055" />

the best bass players I just been to like his guitar player in the butt it's a weird connection ride like most people don't think of rock and roll and bow hunting at the same age is there so do you think removed but there I was geographically in Michigan Firestorm of musical influence all the best musicians in the world have till you come out of Detroit from Motown Bob Seger now Kid Rock Eminem and just just killer killer bands MC5 I got a great Quinn Kramer story he is a wonderful book coming out called the hard stuff you need to have Wayne Kramer on your show me kisses in from New York New York MC five mistakes and near-death heroin prison Dirtbag Maneuvers but he's a great man a musical Authority and in the music of Detroit and of course 50s Little Richard how do you not get

<timemark seconds="4175" />

all the way back to the 1950s 2006 I did for years I took out all the books that start at him up from the from my Musical review with the Royal School of Music in 1958 and then with jopa Dorsett from the capitol School of Music at the city Detroit Fairgrounds and we started playing sock hops and pool parties and mulch shops and everywhere you know basement parties I counted those are Gates and then when the Amboy Dukes started in 65 we do 300 concert 3 + 300 a year for many many years and even with the Damn Yankees know we did over 200 concerts a year so I have them all up in last year was 6679 in Okinawa for the US Marine Corps pretty intense and then last night at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano 6686 681

<timemark seconds="4235" />

remedy how do you have the time cuz I always figure out I try to figure out how I have the time to do what I do but I think you do more than I do I think we can both agree the greatest philosopher of all times was Dirty Harry and when you said a good man knows his limitations back of the app with the Amboy Dukes would do over 300 concepts of here and I was still craving my hunting so I carve out a weekend in October in a week in November with my dad would get out there and hunt but that wasn't enough for about practice time but with the archery bow and arrow on the road to take her out like a blocked heart absolutely no parking on stage and then I always have it with me and I always have friends that have bows and arrows in fact I wish I brought it today cuz I could show you some more this is an of mystical Flight of The Arrow maneuvers

<timemark seconds="4295" />

you're awesome just not a bad boy competition is awesome a bow and arrow Stitch rainbow shop can I measured find a bow that fits you and make sure it's graceful enough don't struggle when you're starting to be Scott to come back mushy archery is Grace not power and get that bowl so it settles back here for hand-eye coordination and you don't have to struggle people should start with a 25 30 pound bow to get that archery thing going to be no recurve Longbow if you can and find out where your point and where's that are all going and you will be consumed with it and then work because if you do it wrong and you start out of the bachelor your bad habits of play and then you hit Target Manuel it said that's a promise martial arts to it's really important to start off with a good instructor if you learn things poorly first

<timemark seconds="4355" />

and then try to refix it but you're still kind of wired incorrectly and it's very difficult and archery as well right that's why America is in trouble because people are learning at schools it's about that's a really good and really learn the wrong for me to really is what's going on you know you get taught that life is boring droning pay attention to the rules show me up in the Box show me a graduate from the American anti-education system that can balance a checkbook do people do that anymore but you know what i'm responsible be accountable utilitarian self-sufficiency be the best that you can be call your body is sacred Temple that it's supposed to be treated with reverence eat good be good be the best that you can be be competitive life isn't fair get used to it if you want to excel in life you sure

<timemark seconds="4415" />

earlier than the competition you were tired of the competition you better job in a competition you stay later than the competition you'll end up on the damn company yeah I'm learning how to think Bernie has think and learning how to look at things but it's something that's never taught in school and it's one of the most important lessons in your life and you have learned that lesson I think they're doing difficult things Absalom in the conversation about you want since it was like wait what what do you think he's like look this way you have to understand forget about all the public shit he's awesome at two things that are really hard to be good at guitar and bow hunting buried if they're both very difficult to be disciplined mean exceptional person especially since you sound like such shit for so long and the guitar there's no satisfaction all my buddies learn faster than I did that guy just met up with Donny Anderson he probably listening right now and he was in a band called The Gang when I had a band called The Lord's we kick their ass won the battle of the bands in Michigan when I was about

<timemark seconds="4475" />

<timemark seconds="4595" />

anti logic like what lake did you don't need secure borders really so the Democrats don't think we need to secure our borders and the Democrats don't admit there's a difference between legal immigration and illegal immigration let me give you a little on metaphor if you go to the bank and withdraw from your account you're a legal Banker if you go to the bank and draw from someone else's account you're a bank robber there was a division there were four legal banking for her not for illegal Banking and this kind of anti logical is weaseled his way into policy and it's just tragic with their multitrillion-dollar debt and unsecured borders worried about separating families we failed to say if you're going to come here come legally or we will send you back we send out a message from across the dam River

<timemark seconds="4645" />

do you personally have a problem when they separate families cuz I sure I do I'm a father and a grandfather Yeah but fucked up but the real fuck up starts with the the the insane any responsibilities of Derringer subject your children to that don't think they have any choice of things to do over there they living in Mexico or Guatemala is infested government military law enforcement shithole was awesome XO hasn't been raped and pillaged yet but give him time he'll make it there murdering and raping and killing people I mean it's just a hell hole is definitely some bad things happen in the lot of it is cuz of the drug war out of control and a lot of people think that the remedy to that is legalizing drugs and Taxi man yeah yeah I mean the same thing with prohibition

<timemark seconds="4705" />

same thing would happen in America with the really boosted organized crime and Al Capone and they they got a stronghold because of the money they were making from illegal drugs I take all the time I think that right now is that the spoiled brat epidemic in this country if you don't get everything you want you start shooting people or you cut people off and road rage if everything doesn't go just right everybody is so touchy and so pussified that when I was growing up sticks and stones may break your bones but words will never hurt me what you think that's coming from the liberalization of policy in the the horrible lie of the welfare dream that people who need a helping hand are always giving Helping Hand by neighbors and family and friends and if they have them yeah well if the Catholic church has a trillion dollars just in your jewelry they could buy provide some sandwiches and blankets so there is plenty of help available

<timemark seconds="4765" />

but when you get into a system in you you play on the people's emotions that we need a safety net is poor people are just too thin need help okay let's create art welfare where we can help these destitute people meanwhile it's infested with scammers and bloodsuckers and Liars who are able-bodied and they just don't want to stop at The Help Wanted sign they want some of your income cuz you're stupid enough to get up early and work really hard and they don't want to that's pandemic so mean while the people who are truly needy they slip through the cracks we don't even get to know who they are and and the the liberal policy of eliminating the Heartbreak in the disrespect of cuckoo's nest we can't we can't call them Mental Health Centers we might hurt some feelings so now what are they doing they're putting spikes in boards and attacking people walking their dog and I like you said there's no place for them to go when I was growing up those place in Detroit called Eloise it was a nut house and that's if the Cuckoo's Nest that's where if you were mentally ill and you needed

<timemark seconds="4825" />

that there was a place for you to go to get you off the street so you don't attack people with spikes and do Bible does it talk about the spikes into by the guy right here for walking the dog and hit him in the head with A2 by 4 with a spike and almost killed him and I and a citizen I don't even hear about the shit out of them but was a rare occasion of Justice pro wrestling come in handy but yes but that that incident is not rare where you go to San Francisco and the Mental Health institution isn't supposed to be the streets the method example of too much liberal policy get people that hurt a little bit to Progressive and two of them I don't know how did they ever utilize that term that's bastardize it gets so far that it becomes aggressive when you let him bomb shit all over the streets but

<timemark seconds="4885" />

thank you I think that would be an indicator so like they're so the ideas that just like these poor people leave them alone you know they're fine they just you know that it's okay if they live on the streets but if you go to San Francisco they're very aggressive it's you it's one of the weirdest places I've ever been in terms of homeless people and one of the most heartbreaking unquote Progressive places in our primary Progressive cities in those institutions the corruption the abuse of power that runs rampant nurse Cratchit mean that that wasn't just a fantasy a script that this happens that your responsibility in in in pharmaceutical in everybody you know they got a mental problem and then they increase the mental problem with big farm yeah I mean I've had personal experiences with that with your friends of mine that we're having mental problems and they end up in an institution and then their mental problems are exasperated by chemical warfare

<timemark seconds="4945" />

you know but I was growing up how old are you John 50/50 just a boy when I was going up there is this manttra this a colloquialism Better Living Through Chemistry is it is I mean we saved tens of millions of lives in Africa with DDT by killing the Tsetse fly and we save tens of millions of people then some environmentalists djt is a dangerous chemicals they stopped it and we lost tens of millions of people it's better to kill a bunch of flies to save human life then to band a DDT that allows easy flies to flourish and kills people so now it's gone.

are you going to read it you're going to your going to be consumed by his conversational writing of the MC5 Ascension to the most authoritative Powerhouse music I've ever witnessed in my life to a bunch of dirtbags on the downward spiral because of drugs and alcohol I know that happens I definitely happens but it happens with everything it happens with people with the they eat too much food it happened to the people of gambling it happened to the different things but I think it's because of discipline it's because they don't have a clear path I think it's cuz they let themselves become self-indulgent and they let themselves be weak but I'm saying is that I know a lot of people who use whether it's psychedelics or they use marijuana and they use it to enhance their perspective it doesn't become the primary focus of their life it doesn't consume that I've been allowed to consume their life there's a whole other world of disciplined marijuana enthusiasts and if they're confused the same

<timemark seconds="5462" />

people confuse Hunters the same way people think of hunters is being lazy drunken slob so cruel to animals and you and I know that that's not the case at all or are some of the most disciplined focused and best people in the world 10 speed up because to be to be a Cameron Hanes to be a John Dudley you have to be a superior type of human being or at least you have to be able to execute in that extreme moment that moment without animal walks on to that shooting window and you're looking at this 390 bull elk screaming overwhelming overwhelming and it's 40 yards away in your Center in that pin it takes magic powerful human being to execute that shot and I don't think most people are aware of that most people don't know in the same way that that's misunderstood I think marijuana is misunderstood because there's a lot of dummies in this world did you get a group of a hundred people what are the odds that one of them is going to be a dummy fucking 100%

<timemark seconds="5522" />

is more than one group of a hundred people use marijuana the one loud fucking stupid one defies or defines rather what marijuana users are you see that fucking idiot is pissing all over himself and falling down so high can't walk that's what you think of you don't think of the Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt that smokes pot and then goes out and strangles 50 people in in class you don't take a pill to take yoga class I liked high on marijuana strain there should be absorbing and respecting and considering your words you can get away from you yeah that's all I've ever say everything can get away from you that's all I've ever seen I think it's because these people that consume it they don't have those other qualities they don't have discipline and focus they don't have respect for their body see the thing with the especially in the Jiu-Jitsu Community it's super common marijuana is really really really really common yeah I mean

<timemark seconds="5582" />

there's a show called high rollers with these guys they put together jiu-jitsu tournament everybody had to get high before they roll and you're talking like Italy World Class Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belts competing high on marijuana going to be one of the highest forms of discipline very available to us it's a very very good there with a camera name everybody in your lap you you're doing an art is designed to break bodies and the two of your going to do it together in the whole idea is that you're going to get someone into a position where they have to tap or they going to get their arm snap or they going to get choked unconscious intense extremely difficult for suit and a lot of people do it under the influence of marijuana do you know any of these Master jiu jitsu martial artist don't do any baby from well do very well there's this leap years are Leap World Class athletes in Jiu-Jitsu that don't cheat and I want it or not

I can look into a toilet paper roll over in the left lane right now and I did not using their blinkers and those people that did those people when they smoke marijuana they freak out they get paranoid because what's happening in the marijuana increases your sensitivity makes you aware of all these variables and lot of people consider that paranoia you start freaking out about all these variables start thinking about your mortality and instead of embracing this time

<timemark seconds="5700" />

is a magical moment instead of being in this moment you just started getting overwhelmed you feel your own heartbeat and start freaking out this all the time it's without anything it's an infusion it brings you closer to whatever you are when you're not encumbered by your ego admit inescapable that thing affects everyone differently yes but once you make it widespread I mean I started the results of legalization for recreational use in Colorado and how the highway fatalities in accidents of increased but you know what else is increase the population in proportion so causes breeding causes more people there more people are there so you having more accidents there right the promises of population also boom in the economy or boom in the real estate real estate taking off cat is a lot of losers there too is that a hacky sack playing dirty stinky hippie to the wandering around with no shoes on you're going to

<timemark seconds="5820" />

extreme risky behaviors people get just get get real nutty and get carried away with things and sometimes those things are just a big distraction for the lack of discipline they have in pursuing their own goals in life I think that that is the real high in life the real high in life is pursuing difficult thing ratification yeah it's getting good at them and then it accomplishing your goals there's a there's a high to that that's you can't find that and pills it doesn't exist in the needle that high is a high of discipline and determination and focus and learning but there's so much weakness out there especially in society has been spoiled for so long and you get a trophy if you don't even show up and you can't hurt people's feelings and Bullies get bullied in your cry instead of fighting back me to so many manifestation of a cultural deprivation that runs amok in our society that my fear is nice studied all these mass shootings

bags of animal 469 Hogs one day will you play videos that you and pig mail from out at all but that is the pig problem is the one that throws in the face of vegans that's a weird one because you you got to do something about those animals cuz they're going to destroy your food sure they're going to eat a lot when we kill pigs like that in such Mass numbers from helicopters with machine guns were literally saving the environment feeding a lot of people we support that we process thousands and thousands of people get this pure organic pork and it's delicious the best there wild boar that white fat that candy dark meat handy so I'm so we're saving the environment from the pig destruction we're saving agriculture IE food production from the big distraction we're saving tax dollars from hiring Sharpshooters we're saving all Wildlife because the alternative would been indiscriminate

<timemark seconds="6039" />

reasoning campaign Andra creating a huge new industry of helicopter hog hunting win win win win win win win it party time you did thank you very much in Frisco back we are hunting and we weren't allowed to pay the helicopter pilot by law you couldn't be a for-profit outfit must the government pay them to sew sew on Texas like so Kris kobach who is the Secretary of State and Kansas who's running for governor and should be governor of Kansas he's a constitutional Master he he took the current pig hunting law from helicopters that was government-controlled no no citizens no commercial value whatsoever he rewrote it we gave it to Denver attorney general Greg Abbott and Governor Perry at the time and we said this is insane just can't be Texas where you get to hunt the pigs are land but we can't so we'll literally within a week or two they pass the law

<timemark seconds="6099" />

became a commercial outfit where we the people can hunt the pigs out of helicopters and has become a huge success you really knock the shit out of this dangerous Pig population in those areas where landowners allow it then give authorization and it's so much fun it's stupid for that some people need to realize that there's no other way to get them in certain circumstances or so accessible there are millions and millions of wild pigs have three for litters a year now and there's no way to take care of them naturally she might offer less you going to let hundreds of thousands of wolves loose in Texas I'd really don't send them what should we have for the helicopters yes that's what they do in Alaska would have to be a problem when you talk to people or animal rights activist like how do you propose to fix it they will like well you know they shouldn't be here in the first place there an invasive species of people that's fine you're right but whatever Hanover in

a dick I mean I want to make sure I treat my taste buds really good I consider my life to be like one big six foot 2 220 pound purple Rim dick I'm susceptible to all influences and stimuli and that's where I get this passion in this unhappiness everyday everywhere rock my balls off every year so I'm allowed to hunt on your yard essentially leave your house by swerve in Michigan I have to close the door quietly cuz I have tree stands really close to the cabin and it's the swamp is it's a miracle it's just I think God love me more than he loves you because you created this place just for me and it's a it's a glacier cut Marsh swamp fan you don't offend is no fan fan it's a very unique Wetland habitat that's a cross between a marsh and a swamp and a bog and it's the the habitat that produce

<timemark seconds="6339" />

is the Mitchell's satyr butterfly environment which is the Christmas tree fern and on my Michigan fan I have the healthiest productivity of the endangered species Christmas tree fern and Mitchell's satyr butterfly according to the biologist the buttons that visit there every year from universities because I kill lots of Critters that would otherwise d'nude those touchy wild vegetations and that's why I Hunter everyday up there I Coons and possums and skunks and beavers and mink and muskrat in pheasants of the outside of the only ground in Southern Michigan that has pheasant because I wage war on varmints you cannot hurt Pharma populations in fact they are drastically under harvested but on mine I kill so many a great environments that I have best biodiversity of all including those endangered Mitchell satyr butterfly and Christmas tree

<timemark seconds="6399" />

because I'm a steward who actually watch the Wild round unlike a bureaucrat who looks at the computer screen and is DNR office and makes an assumption of what the model might indicate instead of what the actual wild ground will show you if you get the fuck off your chair and go walk that shape that's a big criticism to people or from people that I specially like people in DC that are now part of that grizzly bear band believable dishonest people that live in the city that don't have any interaction with these animals and their these animals are trouble there's a lot of them yet or not you can eat them too by the way yeah you think their steak bear back straps candy especially in the spring after eating berries and grass but the perception is that what you're doing is trophy hunting that you know you're eating your shooting something you don't plan on eating just to put a head on your way cuz you're a cruel person dishonest can you be louder. Talk to the people that are in the forest that the actual people that are on the ground and that's that's all

<timemark seconds="6459" />

part of the problem is that these laws get passed by these people that have no interaction with his actual environment it's like people who live in a drought voting on what's going on in your floodplain you know it's like the people Detroit voting on wolves in the upper peninsula don't live with bull with the Wolves you don't get say so yeah you need to respect the people who live with the wolves and wolves don't buy licenses wolves don't buy permits wolves don't pay fees wolf don't have bag limits wolves don't have seasons they just like to kill stuff and if you have too many wolves nobody spending money on deer license for beer license for small game hunting in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan has been abandoned by a bunch of politically correct ignorance City jerks who think they have to save the endangered wolf I want wolves in Michigan but not to the detriment of wildlife that actually pays for the game department to manage it for a sustained yield productivity duh that's the thing we're talking about here right like Wildlife Management like the side

<timemark seconds="6519" />

do you have to manage the population of pigs you also have to like what you're doing in your your place in Michigan you're managing this Wild Life 2 of The Ultimate diversity that you even if you don't and if you don't you hire text Paige Sharpshooters they have no respect for the animals at all they're just doing a job of killing stuff which is what they do in California with the mountain lions believably responsible and here's a challenge in a condemnation for the California Fish and Game Society the whole conversation game anymore they called fish and wildlife because of that how can you go to work everyday

<timemark seconds="6558" />

violating your oath to Wildlife science how can you force the mountain lion in the black bear in California into the liability column as a game warden is a person dedicated to conservation how can you violate your wise use oath and turn the mountain lion in the black bear into a liability because some dirt bag in San Francisco think it's unfair to use hounds or bait for bear and then you have to go in and shoot black bears with tax dollars and barium in a hole in the ground instead of a family recreational brought up a resource that you buy licenses and fees and permits and guides and Outfitters hotels food lodging grocery supplies butcher's ice taxidermist none of that happens because some liar has forced the wildlife manager the wildlife Miss managers of California to ban mountain lion hunting

<timemark seconds="6618" />

you continue to kill them as damage control instead of manage them is quality control shame on the California Wildlife officers shame on you for not blowing the whistle at the FBI how dare you walk into that building that says J Edgar Hoover over the top and not feel a sense of guilt was J Edgar Hoover was one of the biggest criminal Punk's ever walked this Earth and now, he is following in his footsteps by challenge my FBI buddies how did you go all these years without blowing the whistle on the corruption the power boost and the criminality by your so-called leaders I don't know enough about the comment but I don't need about what you did to me I do know because he's a liar and he's a he's a he's a purger and he's a felon and he had. I'm really angry cuz I work with the FBI I've had to rely on these guys to cover my back on on rage and they're great warriors and they look the other way because they're saving their pensions instead of blowing the whistle

<timemark seconds="6678" />

they're corrupt criminal leaders damn them why don't know how that relates the mountain lions I like to bring it all back corruption means corruption same thing but I was saying what is Wildlife officers didn't know better I don't think they're getting this conversation I think there is some of it that they're trying to protect preserve their jobs they don't stick your neck out with a very liberal government but I think that there's a real problem of education at this conversation doesn't happen in memo circles his understanding of balance of nature of that you really do have to manage game or they know what they study the degrees in it and they just buy it and didn't get to give out permits after the mountain lion is destroyed millions of dollars worth of livestock and Pat's scared the shit out of people who killed people then they kill him to know what's out before they just supposed to be quality control not damage control they know the system they've abandon it and they've gone the political correct denial route and said that the mountain lions or not game animals

<timemark seconds="6738" />

that is a lie so the California game department are liars. With the idea of the mountain lions on a game animal comes from people that have never eaten one. Which estimate Baxter and most people don't know I've never eaten one but I know I have for that have but they're delicious delicious which is it you hear you telling the people make a Bears cap sheet Bergen Dirtbag who doesn't know this wake up. Idiots I've had conversations with people because I'm hundred pairs that no one has gotten more mad at me than anything I've ever done then when I killed a bear good good for you I like that you pissed you're not pissing off the assholes you're an asshole but it's people that don't understand what a bear is he not around but they don't understand I shut the fuck up to research and come back when you have some knowledge until then suck my dick touch late does better to just explain to them what it is

<timemark seconds="6794" />

are there they were there to listen to maniacal levels to protect your ignorance because it feels good because it's boo boo I respect to the level of a cartoon it's also weird too because if they don't there was a deprivation permit that was issued for a mountain lion in the Malibu because it was killing that it got to this Alpaca Farm and just went fucking crazy till like 10 I'll Paco's and help the other guy just to kill a big fan so it deprivation depredation permit was issued so this they destroyed a bunch of this lady could kill this cat that have been you know really hurting her so she was going to hire somebody but then she got all these death threats which is which is hilarious but here's the thing people say they love animals well you obviously don't love these Alpine obvious as lions killing them all the time

<timemark seconds="6854" />

die a slow death because the lion just bites and let them bleed to death and flop around for a couple hours and then go to the one next to it as trying to get away is staggering and that's why it's a convenient right it's like I we love animals we don't want to kill this mountain lion okay will you love animals you let them kill this one mountain lion that's obviously targeting these pets because this is not haunted by the way you know whether mountain lion is Target in the past because there's too many mountain lions and the dominant males have run all the other mountain lions out of Ideal habitat fits into your neighborhood because you didn't harvest the Surplus now the Surplus is coming into your home now it's a liability because you were too stupid to keep it in the ass account it's absolutely sinful they have Android people have accomplished have a pond over at Tejon Ranch have a game camera for trail camera on that pain they got 16 different mountain lion turn that camera in the middle of the damn thing it's hard to find deer it's hard to find deer here it's like it's nothing like men that one thing is good

<timemark seconds="6914" />

dining car accident too dear but if you see a deer in California it's it's pretty rare but again there's plenty of Kelly I fly over California I love California man my blood brothers live out here with the greatest night of my life last night San Juan Capistrano Firestorm tonight tomorrow night when Pasadena and then we go to Agoura Hills and once and then we go to Big Bear then we go back to Reno and we go to Iowa and Ohio and Pennsylvania known over all over the country. Flying a little plane over the country and it's God's country it's wildlife habitat eternally all across this country in California is one of the most beautiful Wilderness states in the world and because mountain lions have been irresponsibly mismanaged now you have a destruction of the wildlife in the deer category in the small game and other game because there mountain lions are in the liability, if you reduce the mountain lion numbers then hunters will pay for the deer licenses which pay

for the game departments in the scientist to manage the wildlife you have balance California is imbalanced it's out of balance because of the LIE of the animal rights that of how the Wildlife officers in this country except that bullshit is just a crime they should stand up and go you're wrong this is a renewable wildlife resource resource and we're going to have a season on it because now we're killing them as damage control they're still dying for killing a lot of work we're taking millions of dollars to compensate the lime in the alpaca and the cattle on the sheep and the Goat in the horse millions of dollars compensating and there were going to kill the lion and bury it no you don't get to eat it no you don't get to spend any money and provide game department finances know you don't get to go to hotels and and travel and food and lodging in supplies and sporting goods and taxidermist you don't get to increase the economy of the entire area because of one mountain lion hunt we're going to take your tax.

<timemark seconds="7034" />

and compensate all the dead livestock and they're going to hire a guy to kill the mountain lion Joe dig a hole dig a hole and bury don't possess the public perception it's because of the average person like I thought you said you were said the dogs I have dogs ignorance and it's possible if this perception that does come from ignorance is that we love animals like I have a dog you have dogs my I believe for my dad I have three dogs would love to see you go home you paid them people that don't have any interaction whatsoever with Wildlife think of animals like to think of their dog I don't want anything to die today and then you hear about a mountain line like a why would you kill a mountain lion you're being cruel but you would only take them out online if you're one of those diculous assholes and wants to go to African shoot a line in the head and mount it on your wall too believable but this is the thought process behind it and there's no push back because the public

<timemark seconds="7094" />

speak to did I push back in the attack main attack you if you don't have to bring it on Bring it on because ignorance bounces off me like personal hygiene from Michael Moore it just has no impact whatsoever I think he watches you don't think gun control how about the fact that he put together that move that so-called documented that I would actually give him an award and he copied and pasted out of sequence the attack on the grid Charlton Heston claiming he was somehow responsible for the little child killing herself with your paroled felons father's gun and they put it out of sequence and attributed Charlton Heston defending such a responsible gun ownership Michael Moore is a lion cruel stoned Punk is he constantly all the time suppository

<timemark seconds="7155" />

I don't know him I do and I he's a punk if you ever had a conversation TV show and I was responsible for ending his TV show cuz he tried to fuck with me and I don't know if you noticed but I'm phuckable fuck with me I'll eat your family tree and shit sawdust into your face ask Piers Morgan that seems like I saw your conversation not even close I was going to wrestling a torso Pierce Morgan the problem is he didn't understand the fax when you talk about gun violence he didn't understand how much it is violence a giant percentage of murder suicide a giant percentage of them are cops killing bad guys are out of the accidental gun deaths summarize it for you so Pierce Morgan fancies himself a konkey rutherwood Eli me he's got the accent and everything that's funny last night actually an accident it's an impediment

<timemark seconds="7215" />

you take on the Motor City madman I mean this guy's going to be Easy Pickins he actually wrote Wango Tango I'll be all intellectually this thing you're doing all those manufactured confidence based on nothing except an eagle that has no foundation in facts of Piers Morgan the CNN exec so let's put Piers Morgan on the Motor City madman in a gun store to think I'm a dirtbag and in a goofball because I know what he wrote Wang Dang Sweet Poontang I meant it but when they take me on you don't realize I never went to college cuz I was too busy learning shit and if you take me out on any subject that I am even slightly aware of I will fuck you up because I studied this stuff I've lived this stuff

<timemark seconds="7275" />

I've been with gun since I could walk I have had Universal unlimited access to Firepower my whole life both in a recreational discipline a law enforcement military training and just our family plinking competition so whenever you considerable imaginable gun use I've been 68 years of it so they sick Piers Morgan on me to teach me a lesson about how irresponsible gun owners are and that if we could just ban guns all the violence would end and of course if you haven't seen it you got to Google it because it is his what's his take well I almost fix them because I so overwhelmed with evidence that they finally research and realized every word out of my mouth was absolutely indisputable what was most compelling that you were saying to him

<timemark seconds="7336" />

the anti-gunners have their dream it exists it existed in Paris where all those people were shot with glycerin across solution crossword band they have their dream Piers Morgan's dream exists it's called a gun-free zone Virginia Tech Columbine Sandy Hook Aurora Parkland every instance where the most innocent lives have been slaughtered have been in Nancy Pelosi Maxine Waters Eric Holder Hillary Clinton Barack Obama's dream their dream is a gun-free zone but we're free people are forced forced into unarmed helplessness where the most innocent lives are lost and that dream has produced more Carnage and destroyed lives than anything in the world

<timemark seconds="7391" />

compared to the NRA convention where you have the highest incidence of gun ownership or opening day of deer season in Michigan where you have a hundred percent gun ownership and access where nobody gets hurt so if you know that your dream is a gun-free zone and that's with most innocent lives are lost what kind of demonic Dirtbag would actually want more let me stop by anybody's position on the other side will you would say the real gun free zone would be no one having access to the gun that killed those people in the gun-free zone means in America would be the band water fabulous you were gone bad in water I'll work on banning guns will touch base of a few weeks and see how it if you can not bad you cannot eliminate guns Finland you cannot eliminate guns Alberta Canada where the guy came into the University of shot everybody up it's impossible so what you do instead of thinking you could ban water

to swim and watch your children by the pool call me weird but the way to handle violence is to carry a gun practice with it and when someone brings lethal Force against you shoot the motherfuker people are very uncomfortable with the idea of an incredibly arms Society. You know I'm saying

<timemark seconds="7477" />

you're saying but wouldn't it be better if there weren't any concerned that the the idea is to somehow or another take away the concern of people being shot randomly by some psycho that you've got to figure out if you get all the guns away I don't know I don't know but this is what I'm saying is that you don't know if it's not then everybody's got guns to shoot some people have guns some people here I studied San Bernardino I started a war I started Virginia Tech I started Sandy Hook I study them all do you know Joe and everybody better write this down cuz I'm the only guy that will tell you this I study the Cadence the bullet manufacturers the rate of fire the movement of the purp and the movement of the victims

<timemark seconds="7525" />

in every instance including in Connecticut including Aurora including San Bernardino right here

<timemark seconds="7533" />

there were American citizens who would have had a gun on their person if they were allowed to and they could have been a meaningful Force to at least reduce if not terminate the violent murders threat but by law we have been so dumbed down and so forced against our natural survival Instinct to have a tool on our belt that in every instance where the most innocent lives were slaughtered those people that would have intervened with a firearm that many of them but there was a janitor there was a couple of guys in the office they had concealed weapons permit but they weren't allowed to have in that building in Virginia Tech there were guys that had concealed weapons permit but they weren't allowed to have in there in Aurora Colorado are you kidding me all kinds of people would have had guns they could have returned fire but they were forced into unarmed helplessness hear it here's the gun debate and it's irrefutable conclusion

<timemark seconds="7593" />

if you are forced into unarmed helplessness you are unarmed and helpless what a horrible irresponsible

suicidal condition that it I'm just a guitar player Joe I've never been on armed since I graduated from high school I've always had a hankie and a pocket full of Guitar Picks and pocket knife in a belt knife and belt to Lana just told me some extra bullets I just have them everywhere I go I've never been on our and I find it how do you travel around

<timemark seconds="7632" />

I improvise adapt and overcome luckily I help pass house resolution to 18 which means all sworn law enforcement officers allowed to carry a gun Nationwide I've been a Sheriff Deputy since 1984 and my credentials allow me to carry a gun everywhere I go and I carry a gun everywhere I go in fact even in England American law enforcement allowed to carry guns and I carry a gun over there it's just a tool if somebody comes at me a gun England yes eat some dirt bag comes at me with a spike in the board just shoot them but what up bro when be better to be on 6 players that have it and not need it than to need it not to happen to have is no school shootings no mass shootings no Aurora no Columbine so how do you stop that do you think you stop that with more guns well since you stopped at with mental health education figuring out how to get people off of pills figuring out how to keep

<timemark seconds="7692" />

people from living despondent lies where they want to just tear it all down and shoot everybody in her a bunch of people over here we are at the root right sure here we are 2018 so we can't go back in history in find a goofball from Virginia to check and what motivated and we can't go back there because we have failed as a society to take care of people or respond with any sense of responsibility or Effectiveness to the glaring danger signs most outrageous Lee in Parkland where the guy called the cops 42 should I call the FBI three-time the guys going to shoot up the school okay will make a note of that. The guy's going to shoot up the school okay will make a note of that the guy is bringing a gun to school to shoot people here is his Manifesto we've made a note of that but are you kidding me it's so difficult for them to do something someone does something.

<timemark seconds="7750" />

no no it's not I don't think it's a failure of law enforcement I had what's the matter where at Maryland at Maryland where no one's allowed to have a gun by the way into a newsroom and shot a bunch of reporters it was a gun-free zone Napolis Newsroom shooting leaves 5 people dead suspect in custody a newsroom the cat is is already out of the bag Brunt

Columbine guys glaring signals red alarms going off over Virginia Tech Guy red alarms going off for years the Columbine things a difficult one because it has really had happened before that can be expected it parents walk to the garage for three years where the bomb-making materials were on the table Yeah they want the best parents for my mom B's these guys were like Doper freaks from Bonsai zululand Maniac different no he's not he's freaky we need to sit down with this guy and get him some help the Aurora guy told his psychiatrist my goal is to shoot as many people as possible to Santa Cruz didn't say anything he is with his psychiatrist that he had threatened his goal in life was to kill as many people as possible and he's now got his new AR-15 to do it with in the psychiatrist didn't say anything I've studied this stuff we need to know

<timemark seconds="7853" />

finally see something say something we're missing part 2 final part do something when this kind of aberrant threatening violent Red Alarm behaviors going off intervene sit down with this kid at the first instance when your kid comes home all glassy-eyed and Goofy and incommunicable and and showing weird signs like the Sandy Hook guy did all his life in the Aurora guy did all his life and the Parkland guy zombie and I was staring like a blinking a sandstorm Somebody's gotta I know I would I mean in my life with her is musicians or family members are going you going to write what is going on you look like you're good I shit yourself man are you okay we need to have that conversation with somebody like the psychiatrist to the Aurora shooter get me how do you fix these people think what you're saying is if you have no gun free zones are people allowed to have guns at least I'll have an ability to defend themselves I agree with you I agree with you on that

<timemark seconds="7913" />

but how do you stop it from happening in the first place the anti-gun people say the way to stop it is to have no guns available to civilians I can do things I heard it's really impossible matically when you look at 300 million people and probably 400 million done where you haven't counted mine yet I like you that has hundreds of guns you know we've almost everybody I know has hundreds of guns he does not like a man I got hundreds of arrows I have for I have doctors of guitars

<timemark seconds="7948" />

we need to be a more assertive aggressive compassionate aware society and when we see these glaring indicator we're never going to stop at all this always going to be evil in our lives and you can't stop at hence you should be armed and prepared and if you're not comfortable being harmed by all means don't be if you don't want to go like I saw the debate Bill Marshall to have a gun I go who's ever recommended that that's what the anti-gun people are you so that's a pretty good that's quote for quote what I recommended deep and every time they're trying to make fun to turn it make fun of the proposition believable should be on talking to protect themselves against killers there are people I know everywhere teachers

<timemark seconds="8023" />

desirable to be self-sufficient capable don't think that's the problem I think we were saying is that we have such a gun problem there's so many people in so many guns that people just want to somehow or another diminish the numbers Joe we do not have a gun problem and I was growing up we had guns in school during the season rifles shotguns were brought and put in your lockers there was unlimited ubiquitous access to fire power throughout my youth no school shootings something else has happened and it has. Do with big farm and the the irresponsible need your bandage on a gaping wound of a of a child showing up a childlike behavior and all the sudden this stuff turns into a zombie my dear dear Blood Brother Cliff Davies the greatest drummer on the planet listen to what he did on the Ted Nugent album and the cat scratch

<timemark seconds="8139" />

although they're all on something through its jets in mothers and fathers out their discipline is the answer not Pharmaceuticals conversation is the answer probing parenting is the answer would like I said when I was growing up we had a cuckoo's nest we had Eloise and people show dangerous and in an anti-social behaviour you intervened and you put them in an institution and even that was a mistake because that it was always a chemical responses should have a compassion response. You do have to do something absolutely Pharmaceuticals and they have no violent Outburst which I agree with two but the people that do have violent outbursts are almost universally on something you're the first yeah if you look at the

<timemark seconds="8199" />

numbers and I've said this many times that I don't think we have a gun problem I think we have a mental health problem just got my absolute is whether it's someone driving a truck into a crowd of people that's the same thing it's the same do you think after 42 calls to the Sheriff's Department threatening to shoot the school in free to the FBI do you think the Parkland shooter should have been visited a little earlier than after 42 and three calls threatening to shoot up the school do you think the authority should have the right to go visit this getting into the spirit of right get the guns out of there don't you think when you say I am going to shoot up the school in my world that would be good enough to disqualify that person from owning a gun I agree with you I don't know what the circumstances were with the Parkland kid and I know you and know that the FBI did visit him I'm one occasion but good enough you don't know what they what they're not like he was you know peeing on the Alamo and just being a dirtbag he was threatening to kill as many people as possible that to me is enough information

<timemark seconds="8259" />

to disarm the guy and probably institutionalize Murray's would take him in for review to a psychiatric ward at that point you can't say I'm going to kill people you can't say that. Are you comfortable with a world where there's so much gun violence and everybody just has to be strapped or is there a way that the last thing I've said it a hundred times I'm going to say it again on the Joe Rogan podcast write it down I do not want everyone to carry a gun I do not want everyone to own again I don't want everyone to hunt I don't want everyone to have an 850 horsepower Ford Bronco I don't want everyone to go on The Joe Rogan podcast there is a time and place for individuality and individual choices and many people will always be uncomfortable you know taking a hook out of a fish's lip so don't and if you don't feel comfortable around guns

<timemark seconds="8318" />

means just don't have one but those of us that have a hint of warrior Instinct and rugged Boy Scout being prepared desire don't disarm us were your best friend within they're everywhere they're those teachers in all these school shootings that were teachers that would have had a gun but they were forbidden to and there are instances in this is something that people that are anti-gun don't like to talk about but there are instances were trained Shooters have stopped mass shootings and have stopped someone killing people it's theirs their job and let me come in on the train will I see if it wasn't get training let's let's let's squash that Miss

big old fat Jewish lady in New York City back in the 60s she was robbed at gunpoint in knifepoint over and over again member they had a 2000 murders a year in man just run away Mayhem she was getting upset she wanted to get a pistol and she want the police station I got need to get from it while I'm sorry we don't get from Michigan but all these times I'm scared all the time it's done once my money I'm sorry you can't have a gun so she was frustrated this is documented case and so she went to Uncle Joe Uncle John I'm scared I need a gun guy keeps you going to kill me so I'll go Joe got him a row got a revolver she'd I don't like it just put it under the kind of scared never had no idea she knew which switch and the bullet came out of next time she was Rob she shot the son of a bitch she know what to do she know what the trigger and no training she one shot the guy that was threatened

<timemark seconds="8421" />

life now they put her in jail in itialy it's like you know Bernie Goetz defending his life but eventually the charges were dropped because it was clear and present she was defending herself from an engineered recidivistic write that down engineered recidivistic the system in knowingly and intentionally lets out in diapers and staffers and rapists and murderers and childless but they keep letting them out those are the people 96% of the time that commit the violent to what I say engineer do you think they do that because of prison overpopulation on my funds veto because they want Society to be dangerous I can't a madhouse motivated I can't imagine anything it's just in confidence and unjust bureaucratic incompetence of responsibility for the bureaucratic institutionalize irresponsibility and corruption in abusive party and I want to deal with it

<timemark seconds="8481" />

comedy of the only shot three people let's I get them on jaywalking okay well, dealing only serve six years of his life sentence for killing those people

<timemark seconds="8492" />

yeah the guys on the street and kill somebody I can't believe it was you that was on her Baseline I can't believe you let him out while we let him out we knew we killed people that he stabbed two people but he missed the arteries were going to let him out and see if he can study anatomy enough and get a good stab next time that our court systems are a joke or prison system is a joke I mean if somebody stab somebody do you want him you want him on the street with you if you stab somebody you are killing that person you're just shitty at it if you shoot at somebody and you miss that's murder you just you're just bad at it if you're willing to throw a bullet in a human being I want him in the cage forever or better yet dead right there and then if he's capable of taking an innocent life I want him out of the gene pool I don't believe it or not why did I put it in that one interview I don't I don't believe in repeat crime repeat criminals I believe in dead criminals if someone threatens in ASL

<timemark seconds="8552" />

get him out of here

<timemark seconds="8555" />

I really believe that in you know who the best person make that decision is the person about to get stabbed the lady about to get raped the guy go about to get shot at this all makes sense I mean I feel what you're saying I think the real problem is why does it happen in the first place because we're society that doesn't respond to alarming signals in the hope of not hurting feelings instead of saving lives it's a liberal Mantra of feel good in action versus tough choices and harsh choices that will actually Safelite you think it's also lack of resources to and lack of these people that they are interviewing these psychos before they snap based on it really psychology based on my tax bill I think they have the resources just mismanaged and Wasted by the way what we're doing this can I hit the bathroom real quick

<timemark seconds="8610" />

and I will stay at Ya amazing you're walking fantastic on those robot knees man it's crazy

<timemark seconds="8620" />

it's amazing how few people can hold their piss

<timemark seconds="8623" />

sometimes it comes yeah you got two waters down yeah he's lamp two waters this the shooting happening while he's on is so appropriate I mean it's so crazy that it's the this is the time so this is The Newsroom why they got do they have a motivation for this guy no motivation is being interrogated right now is what I just read and

<timemark seconds="8645" />

it's amazing that these guys why they get captured but they don't get killed like the Parkland kid and a lot of these people like how they not killing these people when they're when it's happening supposedly China's twice

<timemark seconds="8659" />

is it some fake news thing when he shot reporters you know until the interrogation comes out I feel like it's not fair to fuck it's just so much I mean I hear what Ted saying that you should be able to defend yourself and I agree like if you were in a grocery store somewhere and some guy came in shooting and you had a gun I would want you to be able to defend yourself

<timemark seconds="8688" />

you know I want you to be alive I agree with you I get that

<timemark seconds="8693" />

but that's is that the only way I mean or is it's just what we have to do right now I mean I don't know what anybody on the other side wants other than taking away everyone's guns but if you take away everyone's guns how are you possibly going to do an audit of 300 million guns in this country how you going to find all the illegal ones I got to find all the stored ones and then there's that old cliche if you outlaw guns only Outlaws will have guns and it's almost like the same thing we're talking about when an end in terms of legalizing and illegal illegal drugs and eat when drugs are legal they can be taxed and you can make sense of the situation you can treatment centers the stigma of you know they did the appeal of them of doing something you're not supposed to do is no longer there and then you're not funding these illegal organizations organizations like you know the cartels in Mexico worth back when it was organized crime in America for alcohol when the prohibition was going on I don't think that you're going to be able to

<timemark seconds="8753" />

take away all these guns but I don't know what the argument I would like to talk to somebody was an argument that you could do it cuz I know they did it in Australia Australia so small it and by the way you can get guns in Australia people use got there for hunting all the time so guns are available to casely they do have gun violence but they had like one mass shooting in the 1990s in Australia and they just banned all the guns Australians are there different culture to our this fucking culture is gun Happy from all of our movies and television shows and the solution is always like bang bang bang like in people's a part of the solution

<timemark seconds="8792" />

you know I don't know I don't know man I just no one has an answer they did no one on that side and one on this side every answer has holes in it

<timemark seconds="8804" />

you laughing what happened

<timemark seconds="8807" />

yes I always say

<timemark seconds="8809" />

I love that

<timemark seconds="8811" />

I always say to you know this is conversation about guns you know when I don't see an answer I just really don't I don't see any answer the ultimately what we want like I'm all for responsible gun ownership I have guns of hunted big guns I believe in gun ownership but how do you stop gun violence and I don't know I don't know what the answer is and I think this is ultimately with everybody is trying to find we were talking about when you were gone the Australians were they they banned guns with the one mass shooting and then never had a mass shooting since they have it there cuz I'm crying continues to go up and down based on other social factors and it's not many of them is only 20 million people in the entire country. I would like to address

<timemark seconds="8852" />

probably the glaring beast in the room of America

<timemark seconds="8857" />

<timemark seconds="8880" />

that would allow Americans so many of us to become so evil

<timemark seconds="8888" />

if we want to hurt each other and kill each other and kill children Rob and and molest you want to make the biggest impact they wouldn't hurt the most people because they're hurting what where did that delineation from a post World War II celebration of the freedoms that motivated our Armed Forces to defeat the worst evil on the planet Japanese Slaughters in the Nazi Devil's that it was our Constitution and our individual rights that motivated these guys to fight harder and you know is a martial artist you have to see beyond the contest and it's almost like you don't you don't make your hit where you want to hit you want your hip to go past where you want to hit

we were at United Nation in 1946 1947 certainly break 48 when I was born in Detroit was the work ethic productivity epicenter of planet Earth universally known we were there war machine that built the tanks in the bombers and planes and and pride of ownership and and you got up early and you busted your ass to be the best you can be and you kept your yard good and you kept your house clean and you earned your own way and was an embarrassment after in your own way and you save for a rainy day and you live within your means and you discipline yourself might my upbringing was and wasn't poverty I was never in need but you couldn't drink a whole Coke you could buy something cuz you wanted it you needed some socks you but I got them for Christmas and if I wanted an arrow I had a you know go to the pick up garbage and try to sell golf ball

<timemark seconds="9003" />

backing in in bottle deposit on bottles and cans and cuddled on the rugged individualism the self-sufficiency the neighborliness the giving and caring and you know did take it Village it started with family but you cared about your neighbors you watched over each other and then I saw and with all due respect when the beatniks in the dope and then the hippies and the disconnect and a carelessness erupted and end a meanness I started seeing more meanness and anger and disconnect

<timemark seconds="9048" />

and then after weather was the New Deal or the Great Society which kind of incentivized

<timemark seconds="9056" />

not being the best that you can be and you can actually stay home and get a check and the Unions would negotiate not on quality automobiles but money that may or may not be there but we'll get you some more money and you can make Chrysler's that won't even start and I saw this Detroit go from this glowing

<timemark seconds="9081" />

epicenter of Goodwill in decency and work ethic to Liberal Democrats scamming people and bribing people for votes by getting you something you didn't learn and then all of a sudden the city burnt down and no couches in the street and refrigerators on The Lawns and it just turned into a lump ice in breaks my heart I go downtown Detroit now and building the beautiful architecture still boarded up from the 67 riots I took my kids down for the 42nd anniversary of the Amboy Dukes on this beautiful city I was raised in and what happened to it and almost for dramatic effect almost like Cecil B Demille was here directing a scene for me to emphasize how deteriorated Detroit got this guy in the sidewalk with his pants down taking a dump

<timemark seconds="9137" />

in the middle of the afternoon and I go well I didn't actually hire that guy that's really what's happened here so if you allow your Society to crumble before your eyes without intervening think you can't do that you can't do it with my musicians on my goddamn and we were really rocking last week and now you're all stoned and can't even wake you up but don't you think that when you talk about 1946 the United States we were we were all

<timemark seconds="9228" />

states in the forties I think you're right in the middle of the war when people were you know what United working together to make sure there's enough scrap metal in enough Rubber and they were carpooling so they have enough raw materials to create wine for the benefit of something real going on is when there's no threat and no worries I think people get lost I think the especially people is no discipline not everybody of course but some pits there's a tendency to get lost then there's a tendency for people take advantage of those people that have lost and say it's not your fault it's the government's fault and the government needs to pay you in the government needs to help out so wrong but there's this very strange tendency that people have also if I may exalt here I am with Joe Rogan we never met I didn't know much about yes everybody was bombarded me so you got a reasonable sensible smart and funny and he's promoting honey

<timemark seconds="9361" />

the do intelligently and responsibly prioritize and they bust her ass cuz they're out there there's a monster armies of working hard playing hard shitkickers who sacrifice and take risks and try to start a new business in fall down in the arena and stand up and brush themselves off and get back at it those are the people that I want to talk to right now cuz they're the best of the best

<timemark seconds="9387" />

don't back off

<timemark seconds="9390" />

friction don't back off just comforting and counters whether it's your kid cuz I've got buddies kids died of fentanyl great families

<timemark seconds="9402" />

that fentanyl she was fine. I'll cry for you and you take them in your arms and they didn't do anything wrong and they're burying their fucking kid

<timemark seconds="9413" />

did you confirm if you got you telling me you didn't see this man here's my alert to people listening to the uncle Ted and Uncle Joe Booky

<timemark seconds="9425" />

look harder

<timemark seconds="9427" />

be more assertive if something doesn't look perfect look into it and if if there's needy people instead of giving them money cuz he could probably buy drugs or alcohol and if I going to die if you make a donation to most homeless people to help him kill him right then I got to buy good shit with it and Badger your elected employees we need to have mental health facilities what are you wasting money on you don't need to find out the sex life of a turtle you need to take those billions grant money that you're blowing right now for some jack off and you need we need to address the mental health homeless truly needy not the greedy not the scammers were able body just like to stay home the people who have mental issues in physical issues and the Donald Trump is finally got a point in time where you can fire a veteran

<timemark seconds="9487" />

Administration scam artist Punk who doesn't care about the Vets doesn't show up for work in absconds and revenues that could have got a couple wheelchairs for a legless Marine now we can fire the bastards so there is upgrade happening but those that do know when do care no more hair more in demand answers with your family member how come how come you didn't show up at the family event what what are you doing are you high are you using what he what are you doing I think if we start family neighbors and don't be afraid to tell you maybe I saw your son the other day is passed out at the curb I don't think we intervene like we did back when I was growing up nobody would have tolerated that shit when I was growing up they would have sounded the alarm and I don't think there's enough of that neighborliness not being afraid

<timemark seconds="9547" />

to hurt feelings well none of your business well you mow it is my business cuz you're my neighbor and they got your shit in my lawn I mean I don't think we're aggressive enough I come from a world of aggression. Not being a prick about it but asking questions at some point you might have to show you show me to go it doesn't want any help there's nothing I could do but I try but you'd like conflict you do you know I like to eradicate I like to intervene to reduce clear let you know that the way you express yourself is entertaining but it's also polarizing like a lot of things your invite the sort of not intentionally I think by being a pragmatist you're going to invite conflict because some people don't like to hear this shit yeah some people don't like to hear that shit but the style in which you talk like even when like you're debating Piers Morgan you're very very powerful with the way you describe things and you you you get people that want to argue back with you it's time for that because I

<timemark seconds="9607" />

take the gentleman's approach Mitt Romney and and John McCain even represent nothing the reason Donald Trump one is because finally the shitkickers who work rough-and-tumble those construction guys outside the Four Seasons like the Four Season how cool is that these are the guys I'm talking about and talk into and and they're the ones who voted for Donald Trump buying it because he came out it wasn't afraid you sound like a shitkicker boy sound like them sound like us there's a there's a real problem that we have in this country with people that are career politicians and he was really the first guy you know Donald Trump isn't perfect I like imperfect imperfect is cool you and me good examples but he came in swinging a crowbar to this horrible status quo can best be described it

<timemark seconds="9667" />

it's not presidential you're goddamn right it's not presidential presidential guys got us into this mess including all deep you know bad guys in people that don't believe in Secure borders what's that and people that don't believe in earning your own way what's that people that don't know the difference between legal immigration and illegal immigration but so the shitkickers finally here saw somebody bust in the status quo you're damn right is not presidential cuz presidential got us into this Trainwreck and we're done with it so the Republicans better be paying attention because if your status quo we were not voting for you if you come in swing enough to be rude not to be screaming don't have to be condemning but you have to be honest and forthright and sound like somebody you have a beer with it a barbecue and if you sound like a shitkicker and one of us working are playing on Americans and you would dress our concerns will vote for you if you don't we're going to stay in your tree stand in November

<timemark seconds="9727" />

which is what happened traditionally that's why Michigan Wisconsin in Pennsylvania with 800001 it for Trump because we are a hunter's nation and those families were a huge voting black never felt like they have skin in the game finally somebody had skin in the game including my Teamster buddies my union buddy instead of just like puppets pulling that deal everything went the Democrats have been lying the Democrats been scamming me I'm voting for Trump he's a status quo wrecker yahuza what do you say look lying and scamming what woody woody examples of what do you mean good grief gets to you like what is the thing that you when you think of Democrats you think of lying and Scandals what do you think of people see on the house floor with this huge voluminous health care bill actually said you don't need to read it you need to cite it to find out what's in it

<timemark seconds="9787" />

holy shit it sounds pretty ridiculous

<timemark seconds="9791" />

and then watch her try to form a sentence watch Maxine water desperately search for a syllable listen to the words out of their mouths well did you see where she did you see this thing that you was calling out for people to bring it on assholes just dropped and cause a crowd and you're not welcome they responsible thing to say treacherous every one of my promoters have death threats because they didn't hire me every one of my band mates and my crewmates some guys that are building this wonderful. Bell amplifier they just showed a picture on their website with me testing the new amplifier and people attacked him threaten to kill him because they're working with the coward animal murderer

<timemark seconds="9836" />

the gun nut but that's what I'm saying about you being this polarizing figure the people that aren't listening to everything you say something else can you address it because that's why I'm asking you I'm telling you I know Joe the guys I was trying to sound very polite and very non-confrontational got us into this mess if you don't believe America needs secure borders you're the enemy of America you need secure who doesn't know you need to call Loretta Lynch didn't I mean come on these people are freaked America First pisses off Democrats how can that be if it's not American as you're denying opportunity to people that live in in the Proverbs third world country that's connected to us I think of it as racism

<timemark seconds="9896" />

send announce their allegiance to where they came from you can still Swedish still cook your woman but you got in the bounce allegiance to where you come from because you're coming here here to citizens of the United States Now sucks are there parts of Mexico soccer overall you to help those people really the only way would be to make Mexico so healthy and in in a great place to live it is just like the United States was no reason to come over here and certainly we have tried our policies have been very generous to those countries in fact we're the only country that has been generous to them but the only the all those governments are Rey's criminals Al Capone Chicago and 32 I mean so Infested by those law enforcement is the current child of military

<timemark seconds="9956" />

so where do you sell that and get that fixed we have the right to secure this is not my opinion we in America have the right and the responsibility to secure our borders if you think otherwise you're dangerous we need to bring I want people who need a better quality of life I welcome them I got buddies that came like that might buy some Anne Frank went to the seven-year process from Germany and now he's a legal citizen in America why should someone be able to swim across the Rio Grande and circumvent all that process so we know whether you're going to be an asset or a liability it's not rocket science it's liability or asset we want assets and that's why our immigration system is horrifically even the legal one so I know it's a problem but we're putting all these resources in man-hours into securing the porous border instead

<timemark seconds="10016" />

processing those who legitimately would like a better quality of life in America but first they have to we have to differentiate between the protesters who think that we need to turn over California and Arizona and Texas back to Mexico so it can turn into a shithole of course they left Mexico they know it's horrible that's why they're here why would you come here to get away from a shithole and then turn the place you came to into the shit hole we have a constitution we have a Bill of Rights you need to earn your own way you need to work very hard if you're in the asset column I love you if you're in the liability, I love you if you're having a hard time but if you have squatted intentionally is an able-bodied individual in that liability column you are a detriment to America and you should get the fuck out of here that's when you looking in perspective the people that are able-bodied Americans that don't do Jack schitt saahore bastard is

<timemark seconds="10076" />

tried to do anything they can to get here from Mexico to the point with her literally dying dehydration they had and they would bust their ass if given that opportunity easy it's not going to be easy but it is doable but our priorities as a government are so clustered there so just prioritize that all these efforts going towards securing the Rio Grande with people are illegally swimming across and jeopardizing your very life and limb when just down a couple miles is the legal interest in a might be a pain in the ass but you're here with me today June 28th 2020 18 have you not put up with major pain in the ass is a martial artist physical meeting at soft tough life you got your world carved out because you put up with the pain in the ass you over you improvise adapt and overcome it makes

<timemark seconds="10136" />

happier at night but I was also very fortunate I was born in America you know I didn't grow up in impoverished crime-ridden Community I just had to deal with gang violence in certain Caden them coming in early. No I just think this guy to be there's got to be a better conversation about this and I think that the conversation is that if you oppose these people that are illegal immigrants illegally immigrate into this country that you are racist police's what's going on right now like people love to do that they left to reduce you didn't have denial of nuance and I've always made it perfectly clear throughout my 70-year life I have always judged by content of character Never by color of skin I have to admit there is a racist element in me

<timemark seconds="10196" />

because I'm expect the black guy to be able to play better Groove than a white guy that has been has been overruled over the years because there's so many white guys that learn from the Black Masters did now it is racelis but in growing up I always figured the black guy would be a better musician in India rate nowadays we learn from those black soul artists that were the consummate definitive authority of emotional music from the James Brown the Funk Brothers and chucking bowl and Little Richard and Bebe and Freddy and Albert and all these monster black Heroes of everybody's and does not exist in the world that won't admit that but now because of that influence all these years are the white boys can keep right up there with him and that too many instances are compared to a lot of the rap in the hip hop there's a whole lot of white guys out there I think a job

<timemark seconds="10256" />

Masha and I Anton fig and certainly Jason hartless and Greg Smith and all the guys know Aerosmith and and ZZ Top of me and you close your eyes and there's not a Caucasian to be found in these bands nowadays so wise so yeah race the the the the repugnant dishonest charge of racism is slightly it's one that you can't shake just someone calls you a racist know that I shake it heat it I know but people have called you racist Tosh right you have Joe you know who the races are people to call me a racist those are the racist well and dirt bags to be it's just it's an unfair thing to do that people like to do because it automatically put you on the defensive you're automatically on your heels and you have to defend the charge against raising by proving you're not a racist which I had people suspicious that you might be racist I do I'm just buy just live a great life

<timemark seconds="10316" />

great people and race Creed ethnicity religion gender gender confusion I think Bruce Jenner when Caitlin because I beat him in all the races we raced against that's what it is what a great guy girl now I will if that's if that's what she likes it's a weird one right there was this when you were a kid of thought and only she can make that choice and you have to respect that choice its mind twisting twisting and anybody says it's not it's not being honest but it's very strange to love her but she had the opportunity of a lifetime and she was interviewing Bruce and he was saying you know for all practical purposes I am a woman

<timemark seconds="10377" />

and now she said she should have said yeah except for the dick but I raced against Bruce either she did say I'm friends with Bruce when he was the god of Manliness the gold medalist on everything is just the off-road races and stuff and I always beat them which was just shipped luck because I was more aggressive and he was a great guy and I split a suspect you still at she's still a great gal yeah I mean I respect any One's Choice do whatever you want as long as it's not hurting people that follows what how many people have come to you that you run into in in all your you know your circles and the musicians not curious about hunting the didn't know where to start cuz that's when it comes to me a lot people like I want to get

<timemark seconds="10437" />

funny comedians how to get started I'm like man I wish I had the time to take you but I don't I barely have enough time to go myself I witness you articulated you're doing a great job and I thank you for that nice Lutheran you've made great progress and in roads in that Arena of ignorance and presumptuousness but I'm very blessed because I'm a loud mouth and I'm alive I mean I'm engaged I exercise my duties as we the people to talk about policies and getting the face of my elected employees and hold them to constitutional accountability on I'm like I missed the Concord Bridge so I'm here doing this now and I

<timemark seconds="10479" />

in my everyday walk at the sushi restaurant at the gas station at the feed mill at the charity event people always coming up and those that would hesitate I guess never showed up because I never felt any hesitation there always genuinely intrigued Express confusion and uncomfortableness discomfort with the concept of killing game within minutes when I talk about sustained yield habitats carrying capacity just simple medley understood Earthly Logistics I never thought of it like that before you even though they're going to have babies next year and there's not going to be any new ground we're going to have to go next year as Wildlife on the existing habitat and in most cases reduced habitat but thank God the Cougars can live in your backyard the Bears can live in the cul-de-sac in Pennsylvania and coyotes live in your bathroom so widely

<timemark seconds="10539" />

opted miraculously I mean geese and ducks and turkeys are in Deer and elk and bear there is literally everywhere check out and Estes Park in Colorado that mean they're there landscaping Destructo Derby so we don't need to worry about encroaching on habitat because they will adapt and they have wonderful and again more deer or elk more cool more beer more tricky more than ever in recorded history and worse water in a by that gazillions every year because they growed gazillions every year and one Express to people like that and then I inject the inescapable truism you talk organic you talk close to the Earth quality real food is there something better than venison cuz there is I want some of this conversation is what I'm talking about the people don't know how to get started they hear about that there's all this talk about organic and you know but close

<timemark seconds="10599" />

nature and being connected to your food but they don't know how to gets pretty easy to start a garden if you have a yard but to start hunting that's a there's a great barrier to entry there is but it's easily overcome go to my Facebook I mean not just to be made my Facebook but I am the the glow worm of the hunting lifestyle I mean people have always come to me for that because I've always promoted it and I've never back down and almost every interviewer brings it up since the 1960s because it was the tip of the culture War controversial spear it really was hunting and guns those are the tip of the culture war from the beginning because people were moving from Urban self-sufficient Hunting Fishing trapping Earthly Lifestyles to the city where the heater too and they didn't hear the chicken squawk and so they can feel responsible for its death

<timemark seconds="10659" />

now you got a point there I went to the bank so I use Blount Street term nomenclature and easily identified colloquialisms of of modern terminology that is timeless and it gets registers with them quickly now getting over the hump to have access to hunting ground I also have been effective in educating people on that cuz everybody's got an Uncle Joe everybody's got access to some state or federal open ground and even though the hunting isn't very quality on those public areas often times if you are willing to pursue what should have inspired you to ask about hunting and that means to go beyond the beaten path which is part of the spiritual experience leaving the modern Kush and getting into a wild area I find a lot of my new baptized hunting Young

<timemark seconds="10719" />

old otherwise that they like going deep and they will find that dear that's not on the fringes of public ground that have already been you know so pressure that they moved into the interior nucleus of more Sanctuary habitat and these guys it's almost cry they're so happy even if they didn't get some I got in there in 2 hours to get in there was still dark and I was concerned about my safety I've never been that deep in the wood for the Manistee National Forest in Michigan or any wild ground Colorado Wyoming Montana California and they said you were right Ted exchange my life just watching that deer come down I forgot to draw my ball so it it's an immediate

<timemark seconds="10768" />

aliveness that is rarely available in a modern setting except for great family times birth

<timemark seconds="10778" />

death sex

<timemark seconds="10782" />

laughter around a campfire Primal moments Primal Primal moments yes I called a prayer for the Wild Things actually wrote this in the New York Times we back in the I guess it was the 80s I wrote a New York Times Sunday magazine feature about my Christmas buck in I've written it in all kinds of places people still question whether I'm serious about hunting or are you kidding me a New York Times Best Sellers at number one show on Outdoor Channel for 30 years almost who questions when I know you're serious about hunting all about people they don't know what it's my statements are just how can you how can you avoid that but you and then immediately go fuck that guy I heard him talk more he said he did something and

<timemark seconds="10842" />

you never heard this before you lying sack of shit be in this polarizing guy that does it get exhausting like somebody but hungry at all times we do a double battle with people I don't do battle I merely put out the truth logic and Common Sense the science The Observer refutable is not my opinion I have no opinion I don't I just genuflect at the altar of Truth logic common sense of Science and I share it and if you can't grasp it you work on it and I'm here if you need me but you clearly like it you like ponies Piers Morgan interviews yes because without me

<timemark seconds="10881" />

who's going to do it there lies will stand there their they're dishonesty and their meaning spirited why do you think they have these why do you think a guy was Piers Morgan does he's been so removed they are So Satisfied that they say 5 they think they're Cordon Bleu didn't die they think that they're pulled pork sandwich came like that and end with in just minutes and honest person will admit that their tofu salad has a whole bunch of dead ground squirrels and it's vapor trail in unless there unless I tell him and what nobody else going to tell me another thing that's a big blind spot of they don't understand where conservation money comes from when you talk to them about the pittman-robertson act or talk to them about how many billions of dollars every year and it generated from sales of ammunition hunting gear birds and arrows and all that stuff we self-imposed

<timemark seconds="10941" />

but yeah the hunters that was before my time what year was Robert nothing but the real Battle Cry

<timemark seconds="10958" />

was in my lifetime meters no anti-hunting for almost 10 years my life it is the concrete jungle certification removal from the system by which we are sustained it was a convenient disconnect and you could deny it because you didn't hear the animals die I didn't see the blood it was nice and cleaned up in the little cellophane package and then this is new over the last few generation and that denial metastasized into a cult of Make Believe in fantasy but to their credit there is only a lunatic fringe I don't believe that the animal rights even though they've succeeded in in California they are run into dead and brick wall everywhere else even though in Michigan the dirtbags succeeded in Banning the hunting of the number one game animal on planet Earth the mourning dove where we grow more dubs in Michigan and all the quail pheasant Woodcock and Grouse come by and that's a weird one right because Doug's do people have never eaten dubbed

<timemark seconds="11018" />

all the delicious and you hear about a w oh wait a minute that's peace can't shoot me this is this is an analogy of everything is really in America you're killing piece you're killing piece but what is that The Lunatic Fringe though it really is a little strange it's it's a convenient opinion because it seems like it's an independable yeah your issue in a dove why would you shoot a dove Ted and like listen I'm going to cook up some dope for you and then you tell me why wouldn't you too. Yeah but why is it okay to shoot a chicken is that okay to shoot it. Why is it okay to shoot a pheasant as long as you don't touch to pragmatic Joe watch the logic you might hurt somebody conversations don't take place what would you been baptized because this has a great impact because your average listener does not come to hear hunting truth whoever's listener comes to hear smart-ass dialogue in issue review and intellectual and Analysis of life's experiences but that you

<timemark seconds="11078" />

have inflected and injected the truth about conservation wise use wildlife management is a Hallelujah moment which is why I'm sitting across from you today honestly from people like you that were enthusiastic about the got me curious when I saw how enthusiastic you were about hunting in about the eating of wild beat and how much energy gives you I got very curious many years before I ever started hunting cuz I I saw a lot of those PETA videos we see these horrific conditions in factory farms and I don't want to be a part of that. I was trying to figure out how to not be a part of that and so when I first decided to start hunting but before that I was making to two cells either I'm going to do this and I'm going to hate it and I'm never going to do it again and I'm going to be a vegetarian or I'm going to become a hunter and the moment I shot that deer and then we ate it I was like oh I'm doing this forever after Zuckerberg actually came out and admitted that if he's going to eat flesh he's going to kill himself I think it was a whole year

<timemark seconds="11138" />

you know and I think that people would have a better understanding of what their food is and when you have these conversations with people want to talk to when it comes to animal rights ideas and what should and shouldn't be legal 95 97% of the people eat meat made it's a crazy numbers are life support system rotate food and people think you're just going to stop that listen you're going to get a lot of people that aren't healthy this is not the way to go and if some people want to go vegan and they can pull it off with careful studying of your diet and making sure they're supplementing with all the right things good luck good go for it after my great hero fredbear died in 1987 it was the next year I started the Ted Nugent camp for kids which was a movement forward what he told me to continue promoting conservation in hunting the way I was so I started charity 501 c 3 charity to Ted Nugent camp for kids where we run in Colorado South Dakota Nebraska

<timemark seconds="11198" />

hey whatever your we graduate over 16,000 boys and girls between the age of seven and 17 from great volunteers men and women from every imaginable Walk of Life that I have to vent because it's got my name on the great Heroes of law enforcement military just great families and we teach them the discipline of archery that discipline of wildlife management including if you don't fish upon the Fishbowl if they'll overpopulate no dye off that you have to harvest a surplus to make room for the next productivity and trapping the importance of trapping that that's how you keep disease under control and that's how you keep value to furbearers and that's how you make really great great warm clothes and atlatls and fly fishing in the meticulous detail and discipline of time flies and being clean and sober and being the best that you can be and self-sufficiency in rugged individualism so this is been going on since 1989 and still you

<timemark seconds="11258" />

read a word about it in New York I've never had to worry about it anywhere because they're too quick to condemn me because I'm so good at promoting hunting and gun ownership debate the avoid me like the plague but the real tragedy is it outdoor Life Field & Stream Sports field guns and ammo all the sporting Publications not a word 30 years of a wonderful charity created by a household name celebrity about the most important things in life

<timemark seconds="11289" />

they just don't care it's so I'm mentioning it here on the Joe Rogan podcast because my volunteers have been doing God's work for all these years and plus people have been very generous to shikaar safaris donate money every year and people just dig deep and make donations to keep the camp alive so if people want to find out about that then go to my website but it's a charity for children about being aware of resource stewardship and Hands-On boots-on-the-ground environmentalism if you're going to cut a tree you might want to plant 50 simple I know you do a lot of that every year since 69. It's exciting as child and it's all the good things but you made you do it on your own ground that you earned is really special but when you do it on your own ground that you earned and you lately built the forest it's spiritual

<timemark seconds="11349" />

it's almost like I levitate when I'm in my Forrest well I remember you had I don't know who it was he had some rock and roll guy on your Sebastian Bach I think one time one of the guys but you were you were talking about how someone saying this is amazing I wish I had my own fart it was that Steven Tyler snort of the upper peninsula where you getting that you had him on here you could have bought one hell of a nice Ranch yeah I'm sure he would you live like that like having this you essentially live in an area in both places in Michigan in the taxes you hunt in your own environment you have your own hunting place but it's controversial and this was controversial about it the fence Texas property is fenced because I have exotic so why and why do I have it Spencer why do I have Exotics because if it wasn't fence with Exotics those

<timemark seconds="11409" />

Exotics would have probably been extinct by now but landowners in Texas we took the lead from South Africa lot of people don't know this you're in fact I articulate in an upcoming Spirit of the wild show high-fence hunting save wildlife in Africa because the the development of agriculture in Africa was in total conflict with the migration of wildlife we're talkin all those incredible species from peeling and crew do when gemsbok and in yala and wildebeest and then in in the warthogs and elephants they would migrate every year in a row of sudden the migration came to your Citrus Grove and destroyed everything get killed all the wildlife if you want to sell your citrus well some of the ranchers who value the wildlife more than Citrus and there's nothing wrong with Citrus they literally said well god dammit everytime I heard my great only a portion of them come back because they're all these Agri concerns are destroying chilling the wildlife to protect your eyes

<timemark seconds="11469" />

culture so I'm going to fence my 20000 acres and I'm going to manage it twenty thousand acres is huge in my spirit wild Ranch 300 acres it still has a finite productivity habitat is finite and so they started selling those hunts for the Surplus every year of these magnificent Wildlife species instead of Agriculture so those animals are thriving an absolute natural habitat as his my home ground Spirit wild Ranch in Texas you must Harvest Surplus fence or no fence in mark my words people who condemned and criticize high-fence hunting is not fair Chase are speaking out of their ass Ted Nugent hunts more days in an average year than most people will in their lifetime I hunt hundreds of days every morning every afternoon the animals have to die I must make room

<timemark seconds="11529" />

next year's productivity than your situation situation in your situation in particular because you're only on 308 grabs right amount of animals and habitats you still got to kill them but I don't want to but a lot of like purists would look at that and go man is that really hunting me your ears my at your reading area ready

<timemark seconds="11551" />

lifetime experience hunting you know most difficult animals in the world the most challenging animals in the world record arm I pressured animals after Y Ranch on my open 1100 acre swamp in Michigan if I want to shoot a deer I can 90% + tell you with all my different choices of tree stands in my strategies of wind and habitat and positioning later no biggie just travel corridors I've been living there since I've owned it since 1978 in fact the one place I've been since 1970 I I have like a 20 x the shot opportunity on my open ground then I do on my fence Crown my high-fence hunting in all the high-fence hunting I've ever had is his absolutely Pure Barre Chase is any Wilderness I've ever been to from the Sudan to Alaska to Saskatchewan to Ontario to Montana to

<timemark seconds="11611" />

show me to Northern California it is hunting the role defense plays is zero in my killing an animal it only plays a role in keeping pressure outside so I don't have to shoot that two or three or four year old Buck I can wait till least 5 but I still have to kill those fidget Edo's and it's absolutely sure hunting I understand your perspective the way the way people disagree is at the idea of these animals can never leave their stuck there stuck there so you know that they're going to be there which is the difference between that and like say you going to a Backcountry hunt you know you you park your truck in the trailhead and Hike into job done I'm sure these animals you have no idea for they are not this is what Rich you have no idea where they're right but you know you have a lot of them you know you have a lot of it's a different thing to people

<timemark seconds="11671" />

or in a pond it's not stocked but managed on my property so that I fish it adequately enough so that the basket to be 6 7 & 8 pounds right but I don't let him get stunted ride anywhere and quite honestly in those Suburban areas and urban areas and even farming Across America those deer are there yeah they are there and I have no better chance of shooting deer on Spirit wild Ranch in the high fence then I do hunting the suburbs of of Columbus Ohio where those deer can go everywhere except that there is a highway right there there's a hospital over there is a school over there there's a neighborhood over there there's a factory over here so every habitat has its limitations

<timemark seconds="11716" />

yeah I had a conversation with someone about Axis deer and then I would just got back from Lanai so that those too late there it's crazy over populate so I said there's two more responsible 20000 Axis deer and three thousand people on this island until someone says to me what's the challenge in that I'm like oh Christ you never seen an accident so uppity they are why are most wired species this side of Bongo and I'm going to save mature kudu these guys it's a huge Antelope it's actually orange with black and white stripes from the Central African Republic and Cameroon and so they evolve get away from the Lions wear your High Country mule deer just switched on looking for Mount Clemens Michigan deer because there's so many hundreds it's very hard

<timemark seconds="11776" />

find a large mature deer. On our property cuz I said I'm saying stop shooting young ones and all the neighbors agree just like you did in the Buffalo County Wisconsin which is all just Decisions by contiguous land on right to not shoot Young Bucks because somebody shot at 200 in and then when that's why I was so popular because deer hunting was not popular and guys were shooting six and seven-year-old mammoths and so the hunters that started deer hunting went well I'm not shooting at two-year-old you know booger Buck cuz Joe down the road got a got a massive stag I'm going to wait for one of them if I waiting for them to they do get older and they do have that mysticism of stagnus which is better for the population because of that and spread those good girls talk about that to lucc black people go trophy hunting takes out the best jeans you have no it does not understand records for deer and moose and elk and caribou and bear and Mountain Lion

<timemark seconds="11836" />

an antelope every year we set World Records constantly because our hunting system of being disciplined and waiting for that mature animal are hunting system has produced the healthiest most monstrosity specimens in the history of record-keeping every year so we're not hurting anything by being disciplined and patient which I've learned over the years and my son is very adamant about in so many Hunters are there's a there's a mysticism to that mature stag sure the breeders of our ancestors were the best hunters and they did the breeding because they were more resourceful and more intelligent Leaf connected to the system by which we fed the tribe so those those killer stag Hunters were always the leader of OVA of tribes and it's still that way today I'd like to think and also this pursuit of bowhunting which is more difficult and more rewarding because it's more

<timemark seconds="11896" />

gold is many levels more difficult when you're chasing after a 200 inch box six seven-year-old animal that's been avoiding mountain lions and bears and whatever else is trying to eat it for years and years this thing is switched on they take very clever pad they let the the doze in the Fonz wonder I harass and they laid back and typically come out around and turn them out about midnight and go back to bed around 1 now there is a variance there in South Texas were Age Management was created because they they supplement they got Center pivot agriculture down in the deserts of South Texas and that genetic is a very fortify genetic any out 200 lb or not that rare lot of people think all deer in Texas are little but they're not and if you let them grow which Texas pretty much pioneered those bucks in South Texas

<timemark seconds="11950" />

are the easiest beer on the planet to kill there's a couple of Dynamics there's just some strange genetic lineage there that there are calmer animals plus there are wide open vast private ground which means they don't get the public hordes of pressure and ones that buck is a button buck the first year nobody shoots him so he encounters he smells that person he sees that person he hears that person no problem second-year you little booger butt you ran into people nobody nobody mess with her third year it's got a nice little rack still run into people no problem there's some corn here is where they're Wheatfield is yeah I smell that guy but three years he's never bother me I just keep you for it to your same thing so they reduce Their Fear Factor of the encounter with humans because nobody shot at him cuz they're not going to shoot up the other sick is that natural

<timemark seconds="12010" />

it's weird it's almost like this is a pet or far why I don't know about that but it cost him to humans yes but they're still elusive you're not going to walk up to him and Club on Frey I know there are some places down there where they get so relaxed that they do hand feed some of the dose now they get so relaxed that seem so strange to me but everybody's got their own little preference since I've never thought of wildlife is Pets I just wouldn't own a deer as a pet I would like you're asking for trouble and it's it's not natural but if that's what you like I'm going to have a nice day will you know those Farms the deer farms if that's one of the primary ideas of the source of CBC w d b Wright nope they think that a lot of it comes from Deer farm. Came from Colorado Department of Wildlife what do you mean 1967 the injected scrapies which is the cheap version of the sponge

<timemark seconds="12070" />

normocephalic me into the mule deer 1967 and they got out that's where it started why do they inject I cannot imagine bureaucrats being assholes Isis back so they know the skin of sheep were more popular in America than cattle there were way more sheep and cattle until scrapies came in which is that that CWD version for sheep mad cow in bovine can Crutchfield Jacob in humans and of course Crutchfield Jacob was a result the scientist determined by The Sciences Crutchfield and Jacob that the Indonesian people that got this the spongiform condition from a tree on brains of their conquered enemies. But believe me when I tell you

<timemark seconds="12121" />

live on The Joe Rogan podcast the CW D hysteria is a scam more deer are killed in Michigan every year by feral dogs then all the deer ever worldwide by CWD I think the concern though is that it's spreading his farm in Wisconsin that just starting to test positive for CWD the grill because they're looking for it but they think that it's come from animals that get out of these high Fence Farm operations where they all feed from the same trough and they they they spread this from there I think there's no evidence to support that dr. James Kroll just testified with me in front of the Michigan natural resource commission and Department of Natural Resources and all the exhaust of Studies have concluded that CWD cannot be cross

<timemark seconds="12181" />

species you can't get it by eating person can't get person can't get it State they had on McCall monkeys get up that's because the injected massive quantities into the brain monkey otherwise they couldn't get them but CWD Wisconsin spent $70 I'm not making that number up Wisconsin spent 70 million dollars try do a Raticate certain hers which is a virtual impossibility by the way and even if you were successful the the mutated Freon they they stay in the ground typically through urine yeah and there is part of plants as well there is no evidence whatsoever the CW Diaz ever compromised a cervid heard it's news been no redo Seasons even in the epicenter the endemic areas of Colorado and Wyoming Work started where it's the most prevalent no seasons have been reduced no reduced and tags no reduced in Harvey

<timemark seconds="12241" />

it's in consequential it occurs so rarely they studied the deer for 18 years in Wisconsin and deer that has CWD 18 years collared and monitored still having fun as they say it's always fatal it is not always fatal go to doctor Deere slash Facebook either dr. gear.com Facebook or face you're not worried about it at all. What do you think about bureaucrats scared away hunters in Wisconsin and caused butchers to quit processing deer because of the manufactured hysteria CWD is not a concern Buicks kill more dear than CWD is it the bureaucrats go in Slaughter dear by the thousands so if CWD is killed 58 deer in Michigan which has they found I don't think any of them were

<timemark seconds="12301" />

I think they had to kill him though they did find one in Jackson County they claim I don't believe me I just don't believe your request remember these are the bureaucrats Joe in Michigan that claimed that there were quote 5000 to 7000 Russian boar running wild in Michigan that catalyze that claim for the moment maybe you can tell me Joe what the fuck is a Russian boar in Russia there was no such genus as a Russian boar it's all white tail bullshit that was the official statement by a game agency in Michigan Lions sons of bitches and then they claim here's another one so isn't it our moral and spiritual obligation to wisely use the animals we Harvest isn't it yes

<timemark seconds="12347" />

in Michigan the farmers can Slaughter sandhill cranes which are known as rib eye in the sky right supposed to be delicious it is

<timemark seconds="12356" />

farmers in Michigan can you shoot sandhill cranes but by law are not allowed to eat them was is this a game department you can trust wait a minute. I will not allow you heard me right you're not allowed to eat sandhill cranes going to try to tell me about Wildlife Management when they claimed they were 6000 7000 russian-born by the way let's say there were six thousand 5000 to 7000 wild pigs in Michigan back when they claimed it in the 90s you know how many that would be today show me some game cameras 800,000 deer hunters in Michigan what is there 10 20,000 game cameras it's a lie CWD is a lie CWD is killed 58 deer in Michigan so they claim the dnr's authorize the slaughter of tens of thousands who's the enemy of the Dear Hunter the bureaucrats are I'm telling you in Michigan they have lost their souls it's a heartbreaker I can understand the rationale for not eating Sand Hill

<timemark seconds="12416" />

there is none but what are they saying when you shoot them you have to just let him rot babe you have to bury him so I let him or shooting them as a nuisance animals at the idea even if that's that's the idea but here's the here's the truth the Guitar Center guitar player will help out there to shoot open the season sell licenses create a management plan and show some decency and respect and let us eat the rib eye in the sky you stupid bastards yeah that makes sense I'm confrontational with the law that forbids us to utilize God's precious protein it doesn't make any sense make any sense that the morning W know the picture of the dove on millions of boxes of ammo in Michigan there's a picture of a dub and it says game load but the Michigan DNR wholesale

<timemark seconds="12476" />

oh no that's a songbird you can't shoot him and eat him it's it's Planet of the Apes and its people that don't have any background whatsoever in Wildlife or what but the term the train biologists it's different right and their influence by politicians and bureaucrats are liars. Question to wild boar look when we go to a restaurant it's his like wild boar sauce in my kind of knows a male brother in the woods banging each other boys. Maybe that's what happened maybe they did have 8000 Boris and they're all gone where's the fucking chicks how can the game department use that kind terminology yeah it's real prophetess straight face it's a real problem they when they when they speak about it that way you immediately dismiss what they're saying because you're not there not being accurate than not being accurate with describing what the

<timemark seconds="12536" />

Melissa and you're inclined to dismiss anything so you're only allowed to shoot those sandhill cranes as a nuisance animal you can't shoot up and eat him it's unbelievable that's crazy and they're by the way they're everywhere there's plenty of sandhill cranes in Michigan to open the season a lot of people go to senators and congressmen I watch the episode of vanilla showing they were cooking I was like that looks like a snake catch its own red animal red meat if it's just got to bury him a shot when will the depredation permit handy. Wow that's it that's in decent rest of the animal why I'm confrontational I'm confronting in decency and trying to get some honesty involved and you can't do it by backing off and being Mitt Romney like and bring a doily to a

<timemark seconds="12595" />

made fights at Whalley like to bring an A-10 Warthog to a porker game

<timemark seconds="12601" />

Ted we just did 3 hours in like 15 minutes just flew by right this time just flew by because it's a Love Fest of Truth logic and Common Sense the man is been a pleasure to meet you back at you be able to sit down with you and have a good conversation here really get a chance to see you in a long form conversation rather than the sound bites they can just choose to hate especially when they sound bites are edited and a manufacturer is it let's make it perfectly clear I did not avoid the draft I did nothing I am not a razor grow quick old school story of an interview supposedly that you should all over yourself in high x 2 map you know me pretty well know if I had shit on myself to get out of the draft do you think for a minute I would deny it not to be racist or it was a story that about

<timemark seconds="12661" />

and got my draft is there going by the way when I went in 1969 I was Superman I literally would fertile Volkswagen bugs I was all muscle and sinew I could I was Superman I was the most athletic running jumping gazelle known to man and I went in for my driving or anything about Vietnam I didn't know anything about war my dad was a war hero but nobody talk about it I never heard of the Bataan Death March I've graduated from the American education system so I knew nothing and there was a protest around me but I wasn't returned into the protest because I was making music everyday I mean just obsessed with the Amboy Dukes and playing gigs everyday and I didn't pay attention I never watch the news cast in my life but I was given a draft notice and I went down I went down to have my draft physical and I passed with flying colors colors and I got a draft card in the mail a couple months later I threw my mom and dad's house and one y not a deferment it's a designation I was in

<timemark seconds="12721" />

Oakland Community College at the time so I was why was a student designation I believe but I was ready to rock I didn't want to go I can understand John break my singer had to go rob Leonard from Amboy Dukes had to go so the only way you could have gone if you dropped out of school is that what it is adipose nudist room at know I would if I could I would have been called anytime I just could have been called earlier just weren't sure and then. Wikipedia claims I got a for F major physically incapable physically incapable so they make this shit up so high time I've done this so many times but people ignore my actual statements so I've been doing interviews all cuz they have a producer on fire and I was just an outrage on stage of the wine cloth in the bow and arrow and feedback and use killer songs in the band was

<timemark seconds="12781" />

good greatest musicians in the world so I did interviews all the time talking about the music I love and they never got anything right these Stone Dirtbag hippie writers got the gas guys in the band name wrong they got the facility wrong they did mention songs we didn't perform they got nothing right and every time I read the interval oil God we're talking about my music you didn't even get the song titles right so I started having fun with these interviewers much to the entertainment of my bandmates who would break out in hysterics when I'd make up stories because I'm not going to even try to be accurate anymore he was not going to maneuver of mine we have these hippie Riders come in to take notes and I'd say yeah I play this Fender Stratocaster as I hold up my Gibson byrdland which way is known for and they write down he played Gibson Stratocaster with Dirtbag anti journalist so now I'm invited you High Times magazine and I was

<timemark seconds="12841" />

core anti-drug so I go in and this guy is this I am boy do for that what is it like a band and when he has like a band so it's almost exactly like a band what kind of question is that a child start Sony how we started talking about when I'm with the MC5 in the Stooges and we would part and I go yeah man I was snorting something I don't know what it was but man I just got higher than a kite and goes wow you think I might have been on crystal meth and what yeah that's what they called it about war guitar player but I would die for my draft physical and when I went into the booster give my urine sample I make sure I eat Mexican food all week so instead of pissing in the urine cup I took a big dump and it was green and went all over the place to go in

<timemark seconds="12901" />

wow you really yeah really and so I made up the story for High Times magazine you know the great magazine of good information and. And then it turned out that my drummer KJ night God bless him ejected made a decision and testified that that's what he did we thought it was the funniest thing in the world were teenagers and this guy went into the draft physical just an absolute near-death lumpish it to get out of the draft and we thought it was funny or hell we were paying attention to important things in life and so the Ted Haydon liberal press started quoting the High Times magazine and quoting an ex-girlfriend who claimed that I adopted her adopted my girlfriend to be read that one I did read that when I forgot about it

<timemark seconds="12957" />

so this kind of stuff I adopt you adopted her so you can take her on tour with you so I could fuck her that's what the story was but that's how it works that's not how I think it makes it easier to stop them once you adopt them I didn't adopt anybody rice I never shipped my pants since I was I think 8 months old I've never been with an underage girl since I was underage I'm not a racist and what else they show they saying that they claim that I made Courtney Love blow me when she was 12 I think she claimed that right yeah I never met Courtney Love You can tell I don't have a rash you just got to be kidding me they just make the shut up because they know I'm so good at bringing my

<timemark seconds="13005" />

basic conservative agenda forward that they have to go full Salomon ski and lie and lie and lie and if you go to Wikipedia to find out about Ted Nugent they will repeat these lies their lies. Very strange that she might have been so it's just it's a fascinating example of the dishonesty in the anti journalism agenda-driven anti-American anti Ted anti-second Amendment anti-freedom buffoonery they exist I think it makes for an interesting podcast exchange I think so too.
