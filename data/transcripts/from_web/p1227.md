the Great and Powerful Mike Tyson

<timemark seconds="438" />

The Joe Rogan Experience

<timemark seconds="446" />

and we live what's happening what's up Mike Thompson I can't believe you never had a cup of coffee that might be the most outrageous thing about you if you've never had coffee your whole life never had coffee did you just no one ever offered you a cup of coffee you never went to Starbucks at 40th and donut worry about Legos

<timemark seconds="483" />

but never quit coffee that is that like like girlfriends wives like none of them ever liked off dried coffee at home and you just nothing nothing no no so addicted to coffee when when did you first try any drugs what kind of shit smoking and drinking right how old were you when you first tried to help

<timemark seconds="527" />

wow when you were the champ when you are in your Prime like when you wouldn't like when you beat Trevor berbick we doing anything back then is drinking a lot drink a lot really would you go clean for camp for I guess I can just for Camp outside but bundts fights over and sent yet while you were the first guy that I ever use as an example of a to break that old myth that you can't have sex before fights and I was like well that's out the window for sure cuz you would you talk about all the time how much I do logic made sense to you like I don't want to think about it I want to be thinking about sex I'll just get it out of the way lyrics I'm 6 weeks and yes going to fight you think that was a myth that it made you weak I think is a mess

<timemark seconds="582" />

yeah it doesn't seem to make sense of it. It seems I said yeah they said that the Olympic athletes stay is just like fuck fest also probably want to leave you with some anxiety anxiety freaking out there at the Olympics you know you're 18 years old and every was an amazing shape when you were first coming up and when you were first we we like when you were a kid Dynamite on Sports Illustrated I'll never forget that man that was it that your era from like you know that the 80s Ladies that error code like it was a big part of my youth you don't like you being time and you being the chant was like it was a change of things because when Larry Holmes was a champ

<timemark seconds="642" />

as a boxing fan I love Larry home but gives that cover your 19 years old right it's not when Larry Holmes is a champ as a boxing fan

<timemark seconds="653" />

you still get those Sports Illustrated is the internet you finally got it I had that Sports Illustrated as a boxing fan I appreciated him I knew he was a great fighter you know we would get together with friends and watch like the the the Michael Spinks fight with Larry Holmes yet when Spinks beat him for the title was a big deal it wasn't a big deal culturally but then you came around when you came around all this sudden everybody's watching heavyweight boxing heavyweight boxing wasn't it wasn't boring again it was the the most crazy exciting thing in sports when your fights would go on it would be about should I pay for this cuz how long is this going to last

<timemark seconds="711" />

when it comes to my realization the situation forget that I'm that guy forget that train that hard and I became a fighter and stuff that's what I was going to ask you does it seem like a dream

<timemark seconds="726" />

because I couldn't imagine what it would be like to be 19 years old twenty years old to be that fucking famous it was just what customize you know that was his blueprints to make me write did he give you advice on how to handle pressure and fame and depression everything else is really no ingredients and how to handle Fame you know I mean you have to see what what what I'm Department of Fame is your problem and we have to work on that issue from there but no one's knows how to conduct himself under that kind of pressure no. There's so many you realize are so many levels of Fame and then Mike's is still just extraordinary we're like people people walk away from their job like an airport

<timemark seconds="786" />

there was supposed to be at the cash register and they run out you know they leave their job to go say hi that's not you know most of that person is it's a totally different thing how weird is that pretty weird pick up at your mother take a picture take a picture here and take a picture and I love you just like woah do you know what it is. I've seen you at the UFC before your very calm around people when people grabbing at you want to take pictures you just just relax

<timemark seconds="833" />

yeah it's a it's a it's definitely a wild environment what do you think of going to do now but I think you want to do that's what I think I got probably the best lightweight of all time he's a monster I think he's probably going to have some fights in 170 lb of eventually if I'd imagined at 155 do you know this good fights form Tony Ferguson to Great fight for him a really interested in seeing that I'm really interested in seeing him going up a really interesting to see him fight at 170 lb in kilos

<timemark seconds="870" />

well first of all Tyron Woodley who's the champ that $170 that would be an insane fight George St-Pierre if you decide to come back and make a big super fight that would be insane fight like a hundred seventy is a lot of opportunities for him but I think 155 does to they just have to figure out who's going to fight him he's an international Superstar now you know could be especially the way smash Connor Connor such a superstar ready that the way it could be one and did it so dominant I think he's I think he's through the roof now I think when people when he comes back and people see the pay-per-view numbers of his fights going to realize how huge this guy is cuz he's so interesting he's very humble very very he's very polite very well spoken very religious guy lives of his family

<timemark seconds="916" />

Elizabeth parents lives his parents his family I believe I'm not speaking at school I believe that's true and obviously doesn't have to for money and he's British it now but he's just a monster the best best rap ever seen said 255 pound division he just smashed his people the best ever using distance he knows distance better than anybody he's a master at knowing when he can hit you and you can hit him weeks ago it was Daniel Cormier relinquishes title and it was like it's weird write a call me a is the champ because Jon Jones tested positive for something to the strip them and then Cormier became the champ it's you know I think they'll probably fight again again and heavy weighter light heavyweight

<timemark seconds="976" />

help me wants to want to keep going but he says he wants to retire soon he's 40 you know yeah

<timemark seconds="982" />

especially at heavyweight and heavyweight he's he does not cut weight so much strength and just so agile he's such a unbelievable wrestling to wrestling skill skill of an understanding of wrestling so hot so above most people. It just sucks that he's had so many controversies in his life but I'm hoping he puts all that shit behind him have you ever spoke with him about that when you went through legal problems yourself you you overcame you came out of it on the other end I think would think a guy like him could benefit a lot from Tampa Bay have to go do something else do you think so

<timemark seconds="1038" />

survival situations like that cuz you're so wild and then having a good time too much in the party and end of the champ might not like that way it ends yeah so you think for a guy like him maybe getting in trouble was a good thing that's only if you learn from experiences like that I was just a wild guy was really a look at myself now and save myself trips in the psych ward you know yeah I must say I was really Disturbed back then but you're somebody who got to the point where you got like it's really fascinating cuz I know you know you're a public figure so you know I've been able to watch you my whole life you went through all that stuff and then you got to this point where you are very self-reflective you look up you are able to comment on it I don't think most most people regardless of

<timemark seconds="1098" />

are there famous or not just still don't get to that point where they're able to look back and examine who they were and and doing wild shit and with ruthless honesty to reflect on yourself to discover who you really are

<timemark seconds="1114" />

when you're 20 years old and all the sudden you the heavyweight champion the world just a few years ago you were poor and now all the sudden you're the king of the world that's really crazy and I feel you in this really like I was unable to him that I wasn't expecting that that was really suck a punch right there Charlie Murphy told us a story and it's animated it's on YouTube now of you and him coming over your house in a limousine and you had an evil is it a lion or a tiger I always go for people who don't know I got to hang out with you at one of my shows one time and it was a great I had the best time to talk to you about everything what made you think you could get a tiger like fun. Even if I'm in prison at the time I'm talking to my car dealer

<timemark seconds="1174" />

call to belong to a friend of mine and he's disgusting if he doesn't pay for these cars I'm going to sell these cars to someone and get some horses and see if I can get a horse to jump a car flying tiger by the right next to you now I will be cool right when I when I came home at 1 for me to come around and jumping on one of your tires and I was like holy shucks

<timemark seconds="1234" />

tiger on a chain that is that is one of my friends and my kitten gets a box with animals nothing really. What's his face from narcos real, Jackson Michael Jackson Michael Jackson

<timemark seconds="1294" />

yeah I think maybe at a monkey or something he did have weird so yeah that guy my what a life you lived here to 90s yeah yeah here's the thing that dude live the lifestyle he was talking about how people talk shit you having too much too late but they'll do it I read one time cuz all right so for people that know I I met Mike on a flight and it was a surreal experience you know like from from being a kid and think

<timemark seconds="1353" />

like this is Superman that's what I thought as a kid I just you know I mean like she knows we see as a kid to I think it's different like you just like wow that is so nuts like these 11 second knockout bizarre. I can't even to this day people come up to me and talk about to experience that they still have any talk about meeting me cuz that true

<timemark seconds="1374" />

Thai specialty 2 minutes and it was it was a surreal experience and then I thought we were done talking you don't have a face forward and then he came back in like tap me on the shoulder pouch like I'm down here like seat belt seat belted him but then we Landon and he was like always you show and and and I go I wish it was here I gave him the number never expect to hear hits me up the next day and he's like we're coming to your show and I was like oh my God and I really did say like I'm amazed that you're coming and he said it's all love and I just said I loved you but I didn't know how to say

<timemark seconds="1418" />

MN Alice good you like who the Pittsburgh improv manager man I should go you know I can't believe this but Tyson's coming to the fight tonight he goes Mike Tyson Tyson chicken yeah Mike Tyson a whole thing and you know and I didn't know he was at the show because the show had already started I didn't see him arrive and we go back to the green after I ate the show I walked off stage and he grabbed me and he goes let's go to The Green Room so he took me to my green room right like he was like I was like fuck yeah and we hung out in that green room over an hour and just shooting the shit and talking and when I forgot like of the time of past I open the door the entire staff entire staff is lined up at the door to meet him like that's the effect that he has on the group you know like they're waiting in line for an hour outside

<timemark seconds="1478" />

and I you know we talked about boxing about life it was it was fascinating I wanted things I really appreciated about you as a fighter was like that you really knew that you're putting on a show so that that's something that I feel like I miss you know there's there's no one that put on the show the way you did that you knew the people bought tickets and and pay for the pay-per-view and then you know it's still like one of my great memories man it was a thrill to meet you so I just wanted to stop by and say hi the same color

<timemark seconds="1516" />

no Bible around 7 Bentley's before their rolls-royces you did give away one when you crashed it right top side Robin Givens and we were in some fast food chain order food

<timemark seconds="1535" />

she wear my pocket I guess the get some money in my pocket to pay for it and she's asking for some condoms came out and she was mad that she got in the car into another car that was just parked in bloom and she hit somebody in that she hurt their arm and then the cops came and for the cops came to cut flowers happen here right and I'm always afraid of they're going to arrest me a reference I said nothing happened officer nothing and it was the guy that broke me to call me how you deserve because you've been through doing a lot of that I didn't want to give anyone my wife to get in trouble if you want to just take it easy okay you the guys hey don't tell me that and then once he said that's a God oh my God

<timemark seconds="1595" />

how much broken and he's I gave him my money and he'll take the money and then came back near me again that is hilarious that bastard Tyson is it calls you up and just give me my fucking car by at ya

<timemark seconds="1655" />

what's this song Beautiful by the way it's going to be open in a pretty shortly this is a big deal yeah if they're they're setting up like a resort really

<timemark seconds="1690" />

Lake wow yeah if you could go to like take me with disgust in at 2 what do you do when you want to get rid of it I love you I love you I love you I love you look better, there it is on that man that looks like a message to awesome yeah you were you seem to be really enjoying this like when you're talking to your partner's out there you're you're having a good time with this man never thought that that legalized yeah when did you start like regular smoking weed since I was like 10 years old the whole time we were fighting you were regular smoking marijuana for

<timemark seconds="1750" />

could you going to go to sleep or something at really that never happened in my house if you go to sleep didn't work I don't think so do you what what what benefits you get out of marijuana look what does it do for you if I didn't have a bad day

<timemark seconds="1776" />

Henry Moody guy without it

<timemark seconds="1780" />

and it just saw me smooth me out so that take I'm a whole different person Rihanna on top of my game I'm falling yeah I feel the same way sometimes makes me nicer yeah yeah comes with down do you what is it do you know I was talking to Michael Irvin once he was explained to me that when children grow up in high-stress environment that their genes are wired to it to have a propensity towards violence that is their Norm if it's normal surround them all the time when they're when they're growing up and when they're in the womb yet they making a bad neighborhood it's it's hard for some people like yourself that did grow up in an environment like that to ever reach where you're at right now just a place of peace and if you can do that through marijuana but whatever it is yoga meditation whatever it whatever you do to get there

<timemark seconds="1840" />

like we should be happy that you can get there that we want and I'm so grateful that I am Boston this you know I've never been a person to this if its magnitude at this kind of relaxation is enjoying my time with you I was very up tighter than a sandwich was very uncomfortable with myself did you feel any better after you worked out when you're young like that absolutely my works out the best thing that happened to me that retired from boxing because of me working out of meeting I was so intense with this my whole life my whole objective was hurting people in one be the best in my ego took over and I'm not bullshiting

<timemark seconds="1880" />

still my partner Rob Hickman I haven't embarked on this some come across the skin called the toad are you familiar with the toad yeah we were talking about is 5 methoxybenzoic acid

<timemark seconds="1900" />

College of Medicine drug for if you want to call it.

<timemark seconds="1905" />

I've never been the same I look at life differently look at people differently and if you experience I can't even express really don't much like dying and being real Reborn

<timemark seconds="1915" />

yeah I'm I had exact same experience that's what it felt like to me to it like you stop existing of the five methoxy there's to tell me what the deal with it what the hell's going on Roxy's produced by your brain but it what it is is it's DMT with an oxygen molecule attached to it to so regular DMT is n n dimethyltryptamine and then 5 methoxydibenzoylmethane DMT with like a very is a very subtle change to the molecule and that subtle change for some reason takes away the visuals you've done regular DMT to write regular DMT is Rich with visuals very strained bright colorful impossible to describe visuals for my wife it's just I don't have the words to explain it that's exactly what I would say I've done a terrible job explaining it to everybody every time I've tried it just doesn't work with the all those things they do

<timemark seconds="1975" />

give you perspective almost like you're dying your your your your submissive your humble you know when you're vulnerable but you're Invincible still in all you know this isn't that weird feeling when you feel like you're part of the universe when your your separate from your ego you realize this whole thing you're part of this whole thing in this whole thing's in stoppable it's just it's a gigantic huge all-encompassing almost like a living thing like this is what I also realize to have to go into the experience you realize how insignificant you are sometimes without to Eco yes you know you very much that you really thought you were yeah you are and you aren't obviously are in everyday life when you go places you have a dramatic effect on people you mean a lot you mean a lot of those people that you run into you mean a lot to the people that you love and that love you but we all do and wouldn't let no one stand up it's all it's all relative no one

<timemark seconds="2033" />

no one is irreplaceable but everyone is special to someone or something at least of themselves but we're all the same we're all part of this weird crazy gigantic organism that the human race you know so I think you said it might my mental custom out of his objective was to think of nothing you're nothing nothing's nothing but the jective the job and then I was a psychological warfare you know nothing matters you're not nothing but only thing that matters its objectives and getting in the competition that objective by going through these methods of Autry do you ever stop and think about how fortunate ones you ran into that guy so how did this happen

<timemark seconds="2079" />

so many people could you know he was part of boxing in the unprecedented grasp of the mindset required for Combat Sports that was a thing that it that it was really stood out about him but he was a guy that was so he was so well-versed in the mindset that would listen to his his speeches that he would talk when you talk about you and you would talk about boxing we talked about fear about a fear to be like a fire can cook your food your food or it can burn your house down and you have to give to control it and when he would describe you like it would do would be so enlightening he was such a man of wisdom that when he would describe things they would sink in they would do it they would someone do you say the same thing but they were with him he had so much life he was already half you if I kayak

<timemark seconds="2139" />

yeah and with an amazing knowledge of boxing and forgot I like you it was almost like it was ordained and that's what I always say it was meant for me to meet this guy you know where you go to be Champion too small to big for you what are you saying things he was saying was you're so gigantic in my eyes are ya mean when it all happened and it turned out that he was true and you have to absorb all this when you 20 years old you know it's about Justin Bieber and I don't think Justin Bieber nearly had to deal with what you had to deal with your your experience with so much crazy because you were not just an incredibly famous Caillou with the baddest man on the planet so that was like an aura to you everywhere you went people want to see you now 50 year old man don't give a fuk about Justin Bieber you know no disrespect he's a great guy a great singer

<timemark seconds="2199" />

but it's not he's like young girls for young girls like guys unbelievably famous but he's he's been famous since he was a little kid like when people here I am going for a right amazing about him going insane like of course he's going insane you have no idea what it would be like to be handed to be 17 years old and girls literally trying to break into his house or throw pussy out them to come down chimneys they're flying in on parachutes doing anything they can they just want to be around him you want him to be normal for a guy

<timemark seconds="2233" />

no one can handle that kind of music you listen to I listen to everything that I do I listen to a lot of classic rock for whatever reason but I've been listening to a lot of Kanye West over the last few weeks you talkin about Kanye talks about DMT in one of his recent songs with Kid Cudi Kid Cudi been here in Kid Cudi's had some psychedelic experiences once you go to if you don't want to do nothing else again well put it all in the perspective and lets you see that as much as this thing seems to be important is All Temporary and in Europe part of forever and also, comfortable with that yeah

<timemark seconds="2281" />

yeah you know who said that Larry Hagman number that guy Dallas from AJR about how we did acid he took a big dose acid he's never worried about that favor again but it just alleviated his is worried about passing on

<timemark seconds="2303" />

that's why all this is that's what I felt the same way I feel I'm doesn't matter anymore I think the NTB even more specifically because they think you don't totally know they don't they know that your brain makes it they know that your body makes it they should say they know that is produced in your liver and lungs need some evidence now cuz I found it in rats that the pineal gland produces it which is like that's the third eye of Eastern mysticism that gland actually in rats they've proven produces DMT and if he doesn't want people to know what I wanted to do it again and again I come with you I don't think you should listen the people say shouldn't have too much I think you do as much as you want

<timemark seconds="2363" />

BMG yeah that's why I think I'm going I'm going in that direction to do all day everyday but you can learn a lot from it it's and it's it's very beneficial and very strange that it's illegal you know that it's illegal yeah I noticed that you did not transfer a joke about it cuz it's your body's making it so everybody's holding

<timemark seconds="2383" />

we all have it you know it's illegal but it's like making blood legal everybody had an experience I went with the way they extracted scrape it off with razor blade synthetically made in a laboratory you seem to buy it online used to be able to buy like a a fucking can of it like this big enough to get like a whole state High style I was totally legal credible yeah it's weird not for human consumption I don't know what the fuck you're doing with it if you're not using it for human consumption but you used to be able to buy I've never felt anything like that before.

<timemark seconds="2445" />

did you write down what happened after that happen or did you record it and I wish it did yeah yeah me too if you'd like it goes away like a dream right and comes off you know you're so scared of no no no no no yes I love it I love you I love you love everybody did your hard time letting go the beginning of fighting stop in the guy would like to go for the ride dude home and pick up

<timemark seconds="2498" />

told me sing weird animals going to be a flash flash

<timemark seconds="2509" />

yeah it's beyond your imagination

yeah death is inconceivable finding explain it to no one well I'm hoping that the they start with Scylla syban because I know Maps they're doing some great work without trying to get these things legalized especially to do in MDMA studies with veterans the people with PTSD and having great results they're moving in the Scylla syban they would love to get Scylla syban legal and it's up for about I think was in Oregon is that where it is it's up for I think Oregon is up for legalization this year in a maybe eventually California as well they made it should be legal doesn't kill anybody it should be it's not a bad thing if they regulated if they make it for therapeutic Houston to set up centers where experts can show that they shouldn't make it prohibited for people to own it or you can grow their own it's not a bad idea to set up places where people can do it under professionals Carol shamans Care Physicians Care that's a good idea but making it illegal to bad idea cuz it helps a lot of people you know people think of it as a paw

<timemark seconds="2572" />

the drug they think you're going to do mushrooms and freak out and go fucking run around naked and chemically all is really potent psychedelic drugs are very closely related they all break down in some similar path inside your brain and you can give you that that weird

<timemark seconds="2599" />

ego dissolving experience ego and you've never had coffee I've never had Coke never

<timemark seconds="2646" />

<timemark seconds="2673" />

that's a crazy year old daughter and 8 year olds I would never let them look like that well you know you have the benefit of having gone through it you know no one else could ever understand how how how difficult any of your life must have been for you it's got to be one of the hardest things when you when you did that documentary it's amazing documentary you're very honest you're very honest and very open about all your experiences in the one thing I took away I feel like no one can understand that you could eat you could hear a guy talk like this I can hear you say these things I could see the videos of your fights to the videos your experience but to understand the life that you lived it's impossible

<timemark seconds="2720" />

judge just a guess so I could guess for someone like me from the outside

<timemark seconds="2725" />

it's just really interested I just look at think about this young kid from Brooklyn New York come to Custom Auto have a low self-esteem and ego than a dominator ego does anybody take to be a lawyer 200 pounds on the damn you damn this is weird environment going up that way you know cuz we have people we try to avoid fights and I mean Bryant for my instincts be avoid fights for all eyes and just to be able to see what you do if you UFC guy your fighter just what you do for a job at lifestyle and pretty bizarre you were getting positive reinforcement from thinking like that first time in your life absolutely a big drug is great for the first time in your life

<timemark seconds="2785" />

never understood that you know what else has tamales to do with me he's to take me to a hypnotist he was able to text as well

<timemark seconds="2794" />

hypnotist emotions make you do and how they do it if you relax you go under you totally focus on Blacklist nothing that's right you going to be in the Savage intelligent Avenue animal abuse working you going to do this, you're going to fight to the body can you speak to me as I was younger you like 12 13 years old wow so they put you under and just teaching you that mindset what did he give you any advice on how to shut it off no

<timemark seconds="2833" />

probably why I got no time no time I'm not going to teach him to off switch just hit the gas that's what it was the guy who is one of the hardest things that many fighters live in that I've watched over the years have the problem of shutting it off like turning it on and living like that just wanted to be a dominator but then learning how to be a father learning how to be my friends Lifetime with children and stuff trying to do this stuff man I feel so disaster I have no idea what what I was doing to I had no idea what I was when I was stepping into it was just some it was just disaster that's why I find out I spend most of my adult life now I'm apologizing to my kids

<timemark seconds="2892" />

Harbor father did you think they understand but the shit that you were going through the understand like they have no understand how they know that part of my life is empty now I look different life for my kids friend family now yeah well that's beautiful it's beautiful that you you like Thomas and early are you have a lot of self-reflection you've managed to look at your life and and find out what's what adds value to you what would helps you yeah well specially not like you who's you know you've been checked your egos been checked your life has been checked in with so many down moments as well as up moments you could double the full ride of experiences have to have survived with my ecobee to check in no idea that wasn't what it was about as you thought of the ego checked you would go away I'll be nothing but I might you go wow

<timemark seconds="2952" />

since when you going through all that hypnosis when your 12 and 13 years old that's a crazy thing to do to a kid because it was super effective so bad I wouldn't tell you know I watch the video of you real recently you were about sixteen 16 17 years old and you respond with some big guy who is a professional heavyweight and you were it was fascinating to me about it wasn't just watch you move around when you were young and still learning but it was also you were upset at yourself after was over you didn't think it went well and I don't see video man you were like it I didn't go I could tell it didn't go well. That's why I was going to say I didn't seem like it like you were obsessed about fighting fighting for my car's if that's another amazing imagine that you also knew Jim Jacobs and that way I can fight Library

<timemark seconds="3012" />

amazing this is pre VA chat right B. VHS but not many news fight those fights were not VHS and Jim Jacobs he kept those things on like a regular old projector type thing a mmmm listen to to the voiceover on some of those old fight it's Jim yeah it's him doing commentary on some of the old fights at didn't have anything to study all these guys talk about Jack Dempsey talk about different fighters in the old days I learned about a lot of those guys from you and went back and watch some of those tapes in now it's beautiful now you can just get on YouTube and see whatever you want everything see all of it but you go back in the watch

<timemark seconds="3072" />

I'm in productive it's going to be off lease at 2022 yeah so for year was it 4 years from now three years from now pretty awesome yeah that's awesome well the plans look amazing you know how long you guys been working towards this and we were just we just overwhelmed with us and maybe a year ago maybe like an hour maybe I maybe you're so and I have fun you can have a gym up there hey what I never throw up but we will have

<timemark seconds="3107" />

dude how great would it be if you talk like a boxing class everyday to get people beating each other up do you know how much people will pay to smoke weed and come we're out of box from you after we are things I can smoke weed do you smoke weed with people as regular folks my wife to smoke with me now you know I'd be a lot at night time it's different

<timemark seconds="3149" />

smoke a little weed relax I did kickboxing and Taekwondo tournaments I was I was pretty good at taekwondo I want a bunch of the state championships and i-19 to Nashville part of a human being in the right frame of mind and that's dealing with fear drives you insane that you went through but Fur Elise full contact Taekwondo fights I was always scared and but I was scared before that I was bullied I moved around a lot I was a little kid I was never very big and we moved from New Jersey to San Francisco when I was 7 from San Francisco to Florida when I was 11 Florida to Boston when I was 14 or 13 so it's just always moving a new school

<timemark seconds="3209" />

always deal with new kids and I wasn't big and I didn't know how to fight and I got picked on and I didn't like it so I said I want it I want to figure out how to fight and so I started getting into martial arts and that just became obsessed with it I did every day I start teaching I was teaching at Boston University of teaching a Taekwondo course when I was 19 I was competing from the time I was fifteen I just threw myself into it's all I did every day at work at the school was there every day how the keys are closed. Buy open up where I am because of you cuz he hear about you and you will you were running in the morning but wouldn't you knew that everybody else was asleep and gave you an edge I go there in the middle of the night and open up and workout I just wanted to just have an itch you know what I listen to what you said I said that's a great way to have an edge can abscessed with it but there was no future in it and then what happened was I went from Taekwondo to kick boxing and when I start to kick boxing I started getting fucked up dudes are beating the shit out of me cuz I was realizing like I can't keep people the same distance anymore cuz I didn't know how to use my hands properly how can you how to throw some punches a little bit from Taekwondo

<timemark seconds="3269" />

not nearly as sophisticated as boxing or kickboxing and so then I started kickboxing training and then it's a real eyes like there's no future in this like what am I doing I'm just getting my brains beat in you know and hard sparring to the sperm is rifles Boston style put the gloves on a beat the shit out of each other figure it out as you go along you know but it was it was hard for me to the shut that that part of me off the part of me just wanted to conquer part of me just wanted to win all the time to figure out a way to be more intense more driven more focused but when I did stop fighting it was a huge relief like the relief part was worth the extra anxiety that I got it was worth it just for the relief of not not thinking about fighting all the time not thinking about when's the next tournament when's the next event when's the next thing I'm doing is just that that wait for you it had to be way crazy because.

<timemark seconds="3328" />

wait it's the heavyweight championship of the world always wanted when he died was it weird not having a person like that in your life it was just time is empty nest what seems like you and Kevin Rooney had a good combination at the beginning when he died when when cops died

<timemark seconds="3361" />

we don't know what we're going to do their thinking about getting rid of Kevin the sudden I was saying I want to be with nobody else right I was comfortable was Great China to yeah it was a good relationship like the way it worked man in the beginning and look like but then like all things you know no really wow

<timemark seconds="3391" />

wow this is all what was he training you before before cussed out as well how many how many years before Christ died was he like to hold him it's for you in just a couple but he knew you well yes did she watch I will do you watch fights with you as well. Are you watching those parts by yourself lights together

<timemark seconds="3417" />

because your stuff that was the other thing to your style the way you would come out with so reminiscent of old Fighters when you come out no socks on black shoes I would never think I know what you're saying but you were when you fought Marvis Frazier on what is a ABCya ring with a tornado that was that was when they was Peaks carry you know you were coming up and everybody was just terrified just a wild thing to watch man to be a part of it to be you make my mental real happy though as my main goal in fighting

<timemark seconds="3472" />

what's a powerful goal

<timemark seconds="3475" />

did you ever try to go back and get hypnotized after all that's over to try to maybe calm down that party mind the timer. I never did nothing to help me out the total will help me out did we help you out at all pretty much have to do whatever they want a weed I got to be a couple of days a week a month if ya catch up eventually they'll catch up it slowly happening we were talking about it before the show started that just a few years ago if you smoked weed you you felt like you were a criminal act like I was in New York recently and we had to hide weed out there like

<timemark seconds="3535" />

we're both high right now the kite fine everything's good have a nice conversation fights did Jim Jacobs have in that Library I don't know thousands of them outside of this obviously Jack Johnson was awesome to he was just amazing he was head of this time fighting any Leonard who went up to fight Jack Johnson tropical punch you say the bad guys

<timemark seconds="3595" />

I can Shine On You Crazy guy mostly great swear if you go back to most the greats like Roberto Duran whose mother fucker to the Great's were just wild wild people you know the feeling but then there was some greats that were just real disciplined astrology Marvin Hagler my best example for that when I was a kid growing up his boss and Hagrid was the middleweight champ of the world nice to see the ASAP video him running to play it on the news he was running on the who was the dunes sand dunes in Cape Cod in the winter freezing cold with a hoodie on running screaming War trailer reaction was amazing to get out of your house to go running in the snow and all he was so disciplined that was the thing that I always got out of here watching him wasn't that it was so

<timemark seconds="3655" />

he was so mentally strong get an iron chin and his discipline was impeccable his did you just constantly training never out of shape never got fat always doing sit-ups and push-ups animal races body he was a machine that fight with Tommy Hearns that was one of the greatest middleweight chaos mean as soon as they were they decided to just smash just get into the center and fucking foot it was Noah Tommy Hearns get you to try to use his job box in the house is the most crazy Yeah Yeah Yeahs Sugar Ray Leonard

<timemark seconds="3715" />

what type of smart stay the fuck away the craziest rumor tell me this is the craziest rumor that Marvin Hagler like decided to bet on himself for that fight

<timemark seconds="3728" />

didn't knew that he was going to lose like they had it set up and then retired and went to Italy as a ridiculous rumor right but he's the more won the most interesting and of careers ever said if you went to Italy became a giant movie star but he's the only guy that I can think of him in recent memory that literally went out on top had is unbelievably close fight with Sugar Ray Leonard a lot of people think you could have won that fight very close to say Asian and then says that's it I'm done everybody comes back. I came back

<timemark seconds="3777" />

I guess I'm at one time that's your whole life I was thinking about I'm surprised that never came back that was just my whole life that's my old identity when you did retire and when you retired in the ring that was the most honest retirement speech I've ever heard of boxer give ever he just like I don't I don't have this in me anymore because my life on doing ice when I first started doing if I'm a dedicated my life to the stuff

<timemark seconds="3807" />

he needs to see that it's not even though he's no longer happens pretty weird when did you know that you didn't want to do it anymore I don't know who he is before that but I was still being very successful like when like what year like would you member around Windsor thinking it

<timemark seconds="3823" />

Charlie Manuel 2 mm area so by the time the post Holyfield

<timemark seconds="3830" />

yeah after we are and you just get it done too much I was just winning them you guys eating guys get hit with something from got to be so scared yeah

<timemark seconds="3842" />

what did what did you have in mind because the hardest thing right to swing from that to the next thing like how do you take how do you take this crazy exciting life oh no I get high for a while and figure this out there was a plan yeah and we party for a while and figure this stuff out

<timemark seconds="3862" />

what did you figure out

<timemark seconds="3864" />

that I wanted to do was think so I started my wife

<timemark seconds="3869" />

arrange for me to be this dead being a stage that she created the light that's a brilliant idea cuz you're also the first fighter that ever did that cuz many fighters have great stories but very few of them have ever I don't think anybody besides you was ever put into it at all over amount of various places in that people want to see that stuff like I said the documentary was amazing so people want to hear the live version of you talking about in the city you live in person for the first time we did it

<timemark seconds="3908" />

the first time we did it on Broadway that is right we were really sure about how it's going to turn out so we invite all of our friends we had taken to give all to my friends and people we love are amazingly fun to shop and so when we started they started laughing about what's going on okay, they are greedy show by the tough-guy remind me to do is to just came up on me you talk about myself that was part of it it's cuz like they all everybody knew you would have stopped by but they didn't know that you can be so self-deprecating and have so much fun with it all. That's why people loved it cuz they doing a writing for my mom moving stuff who's playing

<timemark seconds="3963" />

I don't know if the very people buying that most likely you won't change but Jamie Jamie Foxx to do it he could do it he could do anything he can do anything and be a pilot that goes to the moon he could do whatever the fuck you want him to do it yeah he can do whatever he wants. Probably bulk up like crazy to do it until we really wow yeah

<timemark seconds="3988" />

Michael Jai White Michael Jai White

<timemark seconds="3993" />

I don't know turn into a bad guy I love him and he's a great God do you know him well he's a great guy I will really intelligent and a great martial artist to Michael Jai White kilkishen karate black belt is bad with karate tournaments and stuff is very good I watch the train before he's legit legit Blair said real real good guy he's just got this level of confidence and skill and Artistry in his singing and his comedy is acting he do anyting think about you

<timemark seconds="4040" />

do you hang out with you for a while I don't know what he's going to God I got to hang out with you

<timemark seconds="4046" />

who's pretty awesome he's got to hang out with you got to absorb it right yeah see what how that works out for you going to be there kiss consultant you can be like pitch I would never said that I would like to say that but for some reason they have the Hollywood wave of doing things that make you come out Hollywood leash or something. It's it's it's it's really wild they try to switch it presentable right yeah they try to change the story and no one else I realize 2 when Hollywood perspective something the real adjust is just still unbelievable by itself I remember the story of the young guy remember that yeah. Mark Schultz is Dave Schultz at Marshall's Dave shows one who got murdered Mark Schultz is the guy who fought in the UFC this is crazy

<timemark seconds="4106" />

that movie I don't know how much that movies accurate I don't know I wasn't there but what I do know is the one thing that I for sure know happened they changed when he fought in the UFC Mark hunt UFC once he fought a guy named Big Daddy Goodridge Gary Big Daddy Goodridge big black I got really he's a legend in the movie it's a big daddy in the movies fighting some white guy it doesn't make any sense who he's fighting for no reason historical event it's like if you for whatever reason they decided not have you fight Trevor berbick you fought someone else looking for Gerry Cooney for the title is not going to be crazy they did with the UFC Majid with foxcatcher but it doesn't make it any better any better to have him fight a Russian guy doesn't make any sense

<timemark seconds="4166" />

UFC specially for people like me there in the audience to go look look who's playing Big Daddy I do whatever you wanted to use our mother fucker of a wrestler and his brother was Savages there was Savages they were just made out of steel wrote the lyrics and there's no money in amateur wrestling and these guys a lot of them are really struggling when they're trying to make the Olympics team mean they're they're getting by barely barely have enough money for healthy food they need sponsors and sometimes you get sponsors like a rich guy who owns a business you know he loves the Olympics loves wrestling maybe he wrestle in college and he'll take care of them get maybe get him some vitamins may be sponsoring with the end of the year they have various people that help them with their training in their food but this guy came along to look I'm going to build a gigantic facility to create the best wrestling program and pay you guys all money to come and train here and they couldn't help it it's like they were poor

<timemark seconds="4226" />

did you know what to do but yeah and he was a guy was like a trust fund guy got all his money from his family and he was just some crazy Rich asshole and he will wind up shooting one of them

<timemark seconds="4237" />

yeah that's what it is. Just like you said the store itself is fucking crazy enough the actual store didn't have change anything of it so I know they changed that part of it so who knows what else in the movie The added or changed or fucked with the fucked with something they didn't have to fuck with they went Hollywood with it in a way that they didn't have to do so it makes you you question all the other things that happened in the movie has pretty bizarre trying to you they can't do that your life is crazy yeah, think about that reason that we need this money is going to hurt you it's not going to hurt you it's going to help you with anything else you at this point you're so honest that anything you've done in the past that you're embarrassed about or you shameful of it just make

<timemark seconds="4297" />

it's just better this is better for you it's like you made mistakes if people can burn from these are beneficial so watching someone like you talk about your life as beneficial for people because you learn how you can overcome these experiences how how bad things can be for you you learn how bad you can fuck up and people need to see shit like that it's good for it's good for civilizations good for a culture

<timemark seconds="4320" />

I think so and plastic I like you who was like I said when I was a kid you were the fucking man I mean you were the fucking man to have a guy like you be self-deprecating splaining laughing about things and makes it even if it sinks in more it's like you were saying what we were saying about Custom Auto that his wisdom it's sunk in like he was the gravel in his voice nip intensity in his eyes and the wisdom in his word it's sunk in I remembered his quotes for years afterwards because he lives so much because he had so much that's the same thing with you man when you when you're talking about your life experiences of people listen they take it in because they know you lived in extraordinary life

<timemark seconds="4365" />

they better not fuck this movie I mean really extreme extreme As It Gets

<timemark seconds="4370" />

What smartstream other than Soldier those are the only people that live a more extreme life First Responders soldiers fireman police officers other than you probably live the most extreme life ever

<timemark seconds="4387" />

who fucking relate to you do you ever get together with other like world-class pro boxers that have no but the gutter do get him into the guy you took with Adventure of the Ya-Ya talk to seals about the time to Floyd some relief in the same things you found relief in the fire I'm leaving in DMT and other psychedelic mushrooms I think that's got to be a great benefit to a lot of our veterans I believe what do you think would have happened to you if you got a hold that stuff while you in your Prime

<timemark seconds="4427" />

I don't know I don't think maybe I want to be a fighter then yeah they don't want to be a fight that damn deep DMT might have derailed it yeah

<timemark seconds="4437" />

I might want to love everybody loves you yeah well my hope is that with great organizations like maps that the one day people will be able to see things like everybody be able to see things the way you do and then we'll all have this understanding what these things are there tools that can help all these things including marijuana as a tool to help us you can either use any tool you can use any tools or is you can take a hammer and hit yourself in the head if you're stupid you can use anything but you could also use it in a in a make buildings have a beautiful house and with cannabis you can you could use it to make it makes it nice and verse does makes you more I feel more vulnerable have more of a sense of community I'm always hugging people when I'm high when I hug everybody you know I agree it's a better feelings and I mean

<timemark seconds="4492" />

it makes you it makes you feel kind I agree I like feeling kind what is it like for you to to watch Boxing these days

<timemark seconds="4501" />

if it's not in my life anymore you don't watch it at all it did you watch Tyson Fury Deontay Wilder how crazy is Deontay Wilder's power good stuff crazy rights cuz he's built so strange up and wins the rest of the round that's was really incredible amazing amazing 5 so you don't follow you don't follow any of it today you know I'm that's part of my life

<timemark seconds="4539" />

got me feeling so that part of my life by bright eyes. I don't like about myself and find ya so even watching other people box reminds you of it time to be holy

<timemark seconds="4569" />

yeah right like hoo hoo yeah there's no one out there today that's got that mean vicious Persona anymore yeah you when you were in the ring doing post-fight are you saying you want to eat your children who need someone's children I never said this is the craziest fucking post fight interview is blue belt Lennox Lewis right-handed a great it was amazing it was amazing for the for the story for the time I mean look what it was was when we saw a Rocky 3 right and mr. T was is challenging you know Rocky would say all the crazy shit about what he was doing to my protection beautifulest took that kind of ferocious shit talk

<timemark seconds="4629" />

that stuff that you feel almost like a trapped by that past like a did you have to acknowledge and you don't even acknowledge anymore

<timemark seconds="4642" />

what kind of had happened for you to be who you are now sleeping with people that like that guy me living my life that I am living now yeah what people love that guy because that guy gave them a drug and that drug was excitement like you you turn on the TV or go sit here Wego Michael Spinks Mike Tyson here we going that's what people want the one that excitement they knew some crazy shit was about to go down unpredictable you can't you don't know one knows it's going to happen in a fight it's a good beer right or left is he going to move right as you move left how's it going to work out you don't know how long it's been slashed you don't know and everybody was excited and that was that's what you brought people you brought people this this chaotic moment you slapped on the money in the paper you got it your popcorn he waited for the door Rush The Rush of excitement crazy days crazy days

<timemark seconds="4700" />

crazy about hate to keep bringing your head back to that but just for me as a kid growing up during that time it was a big part of my you know my becoming an adult it was during your era your error of dominance in my kids are pretty much

<timemark seconds="4721" />

middle-class kid be looking like to do what they want to go to college everything I was at wherever I would never want to put that pressure on my phone that you have to be the total batch of the Dominator everybody going to be the best that ever lived that's incredible never do that to ya it would never work probably men don't think a kid that grows up in a loving household would support of gay are you guys looking for when you have nothing to do with it boxing when you didn't have nothing cuz that's a lot of that's a lot of dedication if a lot of pain if a lot of aggravation lot of enemies really it from discovering who you are you must be able to take pride in the fact that your children will never have to do that that's why I took the punches for they wouldn't have to do that I have to send the 16 he wanted to be a boxer we get out of here

<timemark seconds="4771" />

GFI to get out of a joke man guy like me degrading from guy like that beating on you yeah that's the thing is the fuel that you had the burning Inferno inside you you can't replicate. Yeah they don't have to deal with that kind of Shame by Bryan

<timemark seconds="4823" />

champagne feeling being left out feeling of not belonging and you're the only imagine that it's fully accepted

<timemark seconds="4839" />

give me the look at you and all I know what kind of mindset is that that say either one people just look at you you're a sick man yeah but it's beautiful that you could describe it that way now if you stepped outside of it long enough to recognize what it was when it was over, north of the guys in the sky with the gossip I want to be like that this is crazy this is crazy those feelings of conquering we're giving you the first success and good feelings of your life and the fact that they programmed you I mean that's something that I don't think a lot of people are aware of the hypnotism the hypnotism in the the putting those thoughts into your mind which were hugely beneficial you could tap into that mine zone right before you competed they need they gave you a clear path they give you a clear path to use your

<timemark seconds="4899" />

Yuri with this like very analytical approach with perfect boxing technique and an amazing Mentor with Incredible amount of knowledge and they just let you loose and have to be in the city after ya bad intentions are being bad intentions and have enthusiasm when you're fighting I love every minute of it

<timemark seconds="4924" />

do you work out anymore from that stuff may not even like that stuff you don't spin class reactivate to my ego yeah wow you're ripped off so they reactivated that's the thing about like extreme winners extreme winners that did that ego is hard to lose lose I'm losing his cannabis lose everything what if you like go jogging can you go jogging that's it but if I get a gram for gram of that thing for you boo yeah you better than though I saw a video you hitting the bag recently played a couple years ago

<timemark seconds="4969" />

you still at the bag still throw some bombs do probably for the camera you can still move you still have it in you right in your body I don't want nothing to do that stuff weird but what I can get to when if you are standing by that heavy bag and you start rattling off combinations and people you start thinking like oh shit I'm actually Mike Tyson like I was that guy I am that guy who went through that I am the youngest heavyweight champion of all time I am that guy to destroy Tyrell Biggs I am that guy that knocked out Larry Holmes I'm not going to give me a platform

<timemark seconds="5010" />

help me forget about that guy

<timemark seconds="5014" />

yeah it's it's beautiful that you have that that mindset it is because most people who've accomplished as much as you have they don't want ever let the past go shit like that goes let it go let it go let it go let you know if you recognize that that's a beautiful part of your personality you had one of the most successful boxing career as ever but you don't want you don't want nothing to do with it you don't want to be wanted knowledge exists you wish it went away to the next chapter in life you have to forget chapter that came before you yeah and focus on the chapter ahead of you yes yes that's a great lesson and from coming from you that lesson I think is going to hit home with a lot of people yes 100% hundred percent because you've accomplished so much because you were the youngest heavyweight champion of all time because you the baddest man on the planet is big hero for a lot of people like me when I was growing up to see you now say that then I'm done nothing I don't watch it

<timemark seconds="5074" />

I'm not I'm not even a part of that anymore I'm kind of scared in my life right now and I'm happy and I love people you know Joe that's really quick but when you think about how many other places to print it ain't how I fed me places that guy is a trip underwear holding a tiger or a change the trip man what did you go to the psych ward for skin crazy violent

<timemark seconds="5102" />

probably thought about hurting myself or something crazy like that what do they do when they take in the psych ward how do they treat you the same way everybody treated since Mike is how they take care of you what do they do for you metallic take my Tyson, down

<timemark seconds="5126" />

yeah that is what I do huh it's calm you down medically pharmaceutically and then once the guy you calm down enough to go or I can go I don't know I don't think I ever get calm down and do the time for me to go I have to go what is a day in the life of Mike Tyson like now look what is it was it a typical day of get up in the morning I go to my office

<timemark seconds="5155" />

cannabis office we do deals and we get Investments and I come home at 5 and I go see my kids listen to the office later and I'll come over and hang out my wife and my kids it's really bizarre life we staying at Newport Beach now that's not really a very very upscale but it's very quiet and then my daughter plays tennis if you're so we're pretty much I'm situated up to the Hollywood Newports nice though the good place is near the ocean. Clean are always crazy and the fight between great parties are some great party fellow is great so you settled into this business life it seems like pretty easily like you you seem to be

<timemark seconds="5215" />

hey friend I want to do and if it's an Alexis is a fresh start

<timemark seconds="5222" />

no means of ejected in eggs and I've been in volcano on infinite involving myself what is all been fed of a fresh start I feel fresh field knew it. And that could be in my way and it's just awesome feeling so this is from doing that one DMT experiences sent you into it's just right you know but he had this really am I don't know what it is

<timemark seconds="5250" />

I'm trying to figure it out but I've changed but it still figured I just don't know how ya I describe it for a lot of people it's like resetting a computer you reset a computer out of fresh new desktop is only one folder on the desktop in that folder says my old bullshit is it a real feeling just a really help I am I lying to myself again till the next moment I next Billy come to do some drugs with to be with somebody else and what's really going on is that feeling go to come back and feel like I'm never coming back it it can never come back if you decide it's never coming back but you have to make that decision pretty much every day but you can you can never come back if you want or you could slip into the old ways that's what a lot of people do one of the twin lot of people fall into drug Edition relapsing when they relapse they're not physically addicted when they relapse obviously they're clean and then they decide to go back in its cuz

<timemark seconds="5310" />

discomfort In Those Old patterns because this new way of life is just they get anxiety they feel like it's a lot of pressure to stay clean I hate that I always hated that one of the drive between I do when my GHIN yeah yeah is a worshipper at I want you to be going all out now you start draw Eagle inflating and self-deprecating it up the structure it also alleviates you from the responsibility of improving the hundred that pressure of likes keeping it together staying sober you know being disciplined all that stuff once it's gone it's gone crazy I'm crazy that's just what I do I'm crazy and it's easy to fall

<timemark seconds="5370" />

the Trap and that's what happens to a lot of people who relapse with drugs I never want to go back to that I can I see how that's just a no-win situation that's one of the great things about marijuana that people don't understand they think that a drug is a drug is a drug they're all fall under the same category but you can use marijuana and just be peaceful and not chaotic and the opposite of make you stink more about the consequences of ruining your life

<timemark seconds="5399" />

Com go sign up all right we did it I just sat down and got high with Mike Tyson

<timemark seconds="5810" />

I got to tell you that all the podcast that have ever done that were weird that might have been the one of the weirdest once because

<timemark seconds="5820" />

you know podcasts are strange anyway yeah I'm trying to steer the conversation

<timemark seconds="5829" />

it seems like a highfalutin word called an art form but there is some artistic and creative aspect to it there's some engineering to it not always sometimes it just float sometimes it's just fun

<timemark seconds="5842" />

but with him I had so many questions and he was such a big part of my youth remembering Mike Tyson when he was the man when he was a smashing people it was just it was giant part of culture and I was I've always been fascinated at what kind of pressure that man must have been under and what what he must have gone through so it was a really important it was really important podcast for me because although I never experienced anything remotely like what he did I did fight for a long time and when I was fighting I don't think I like myself and I think I dealt with the residual of that for a long time and nothing like him no and onion and I had a feeling when I was bringing the stuff out up with him that he was going to have some epic response and he certainly did and I just love that he's in a different place now and I love that he's not clean to the pass at all he's just want to let it go and

<timemark seconds="5901" />

fetus happy positive person that he is now very very interesting but you know there was a lot of people in today's culture a lot of people

<timemark seconds="5912" />

you know especially in this me to era people are very reluctant to hear from a guy like Mike Tyson

<timemark seconds="5919" />

and dumb I would say you know if you have a friend that's like that asked them to put their reservations aside and listen to this cuz I don't I don't think very many people understand what he went through as a child and what would set him up for who he became as an adult and how hard he's worked to try to escape the clutches of his past and I do think that everyone should have some form some path of redemption in me if we if you're out there in the street if you're free we should we should try to find ways to forgive people and try to find Redemption and I think Mike Tyson is earned that I really do that's my personal opinion but I really enjoy talking to him it was just it was very strange very strange and very use the word very powerful

<timemark seconds="5967" />

that's it much love to you people I hope you enjoy it as much as I did and got a lot of crazy podcast coming up we have not locked down as Kanye thing I got to go hang out with him. Calm down I did talk to on the phone now and he's a very sweet guy I really enjoy talking to him on the phone I like them I like them I like a nice person I like we had a nice conversation all right see you soon bye
