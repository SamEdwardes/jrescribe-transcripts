this episode of the podcast this with Makayla Peterson McKayla is the daughter of Jordan Peterson and she has a fascinating story and one that is much of a line in the media she is on a diet called the carnivore diet she has severe autoimmune issues I mean really really severe and she will go into them in great detail on this podcast is fascinating the relief that she has found and we try to sort it out and try to figure out why she is found this relief through eating only meat she's on this radical new Dinan hola Tio rolling your eyes right now I don't know I'm not on it I find it fascinating though I find a fasting for people that seem to be perhaps allergic to almost all foods it's fucking very crazy to think but she might be one of those people and there might be others that are hearing this and even if you're not

<timemark seconds="498" />

there might be some benefits this diet and the key word is might I don't know if it's for everybody in many people that I trust quite a bit with nutrition advice and knowledge are extremely skeptical and rightly so

<timemark seconds="514" />

but for her it seems to be working out fantastic and her story is a very good one she's a very very intelligent and interesting person so please give it up from Kayla Peterson The Joe Rogan Experience

<timemark seconds="529" />

Joe Rogan podcast

<timemark seconds="531" />

all day

<timemark seconds="535" />

yes hello hello what's happening not much I'm excited to be here is it weird to have to check yourself constantly make sure you're on your on steady ground and not say anything ridiculous kind of salad just a was away for awhile and then when I came back to the house especially cuz the house is sold like paintings and masks and statues and like thirty two different paint colors make him back and was like oh maybe he's a bit eccentric

<timemark seconds="574" />

eccentric off air about what it was like to watch your dad become famous and in become famous and in his fifties right like 5455 before that respected Professor one issue with this one transgender Bill does the preferred pronouns Bill and then foam Off to the Races and strange it was him and how what was actually happening at the events wasn't what was being portrayed in the media so that was weird to watch and then people recognizing him on the street is strange yes what happened in real life was not was what was being betrayed like what was different

<timemark seconds="626" />

mostly what he was saying so most of what he said is on film anyway so you can go to YouTube and see what he's been saying like not there's not like some secret that's going around but what's been portrayed has been so much more negative than what he's actually said or it'll take like sound bites and just we've a story that isn't quite true which I didn't read it for some reason I now it looks silly but for some reason I just thought that what the media was portraying was honest. That issue I've talked about this before but the issue is clicks and it's not just about what's the facts of the story about these Publications are struggling to stay alive

<timemark seconds="675" />

and one of the only ways that they can get people to click on stories is salacious headlines make things really quick baby and that's what they focus on and they focus on negative aspects of going to get people riled up have to have an angle and I've talked to people were writers who will write something and then I'll talk to them and I'll say hey man this is not what we talked about or what happened and they said I'm going to be honest with you I didn't even write that the headline was completely written by the editor so the editor came in change it all up change this switched to put some... Side of things you know I feel so cut off sentences so that they seemed more you know just more controversial than they really are because they didn't allow the counter point of that you don't sometimes you say something new you say or it could be this or the or it could be this part is cut out you know they do things like that just to stay alive because I think when I mean really big publication for there's a New York Times or would another Boston

<timemark seconds="735" />

big Publications are struggling for their life right now because people want to buy newspapers anymore and you know and getting people to read things online is very difficult and you have to do you have to do something salacious you have to do something that's enticing for them to click on it yeah I guess but when you say that's just driving them down the other fucked it's it's a bad place to be and I think it's you know it opens up the door for alternative media but some of those alternative media sources don't have journalistic integrity either so that it becomes a real issue you know that's that that's a problem with lot of online new shows is like they take a very obvious editorial spin as well on the news and if you just read or watch their show you would go oh oh well it's this way because these guys are saying it's this way but it might not be that way there's no real objective source is very hard to find a good

<timemark seconds="795" />

objective Source I mean sometimes I count on the New York Times but there's been some things that I've read from the New York Times I know are not accurate or something yeah he didn't make it any easier on himself by using that forced monogamy argument enforced monogamy argument or term cuz I don't even with when you understand it as a psychological concept that is a culturally enforced idea I still don't think that applies to incels I don't I just don't think it has I don't think it makes any difference at all and he and I discussed it on the podcast I'm like you're not just because you'd say it's a good idea and the culture agrees it's a good idea for people to be monogamous I don't necessarily think that that is going to help these guys at all I don't think we know it's going to help this guy's yeah all individuals and their situations very but we'll go we're talkin

<timemark seconds="855" />

people like what the fuck are they talking about there was a quote in the New York Times where this woman was asking him what to do about these in cells which are involuntary celibates in one of them had driven a car into a crowd of people and killed a bunch of people cuz he was frustrated because he couldn't find a mate and your dad suggested that in for culturally enforcement Naga me would be perhaps a solution for that and then a bunch of people went crazy saying that like women he's saying that women should sacrifice candles and fuck these guys so they don't drive cars in the crowds I really don't but now with that but that is that what those kind of articles are like the editorial articles and opinion articles it's really it's a different thing than report

<timemark seconds="915" />

the news right yeah I thought I saw it so honesty was always a big thing in our house and was like don't lie because if you lie eventually the LIE will surface and will be so much bigger than the hell you get from telling the truth so I kind of just assumed that the media did that yeah the world just worked like that but now so you and your dad are both on this wacky diet both on this wacky carnivore this is probably one of the most controversial things in relationship to in relation to food today when when people discuss diets you know a lot of people that are vegetarian or vegan or try and ketogenic diet or paleo

<timemark seconds="968" />

but when you say carnivore that is one of the ones where people just universally seem to like step back roll their eyes most people don't think it's a good idea you know why they don't think it's a good idea and then you tell them about people like you or my friend Chris Bell who has similar autoimmune issue and he said hip to hip replacements he's only 36 and I think he was 30 right pretty sure cuz he's had him for quite a few years massive joint pain all sorts of issue and you when did you got a hip replacement how old were you 17 and an ankle replacement 17 that's crazy

<timemark seconds="1018" />

what do you sell your whole life you've had arthritis issues or so I started walking kind of funny when I was to guarding my mom and she brought me to the doctor and they said it's just having growing pains or something when I was 7 I was diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and I had like 37 joints affected and then I was put on immune suppressants and grade for us or is actually the first kid in Canada to be put on that this biological denbrough those on Enbrel and Methotrexate for ever like leading up to the hip and ankle replacement and they did help reduce some of the pain but I still ended up with no cartilage in my joint and have my hip and ankle when I was 17 and this is just from the effects of arthritis and inflammation swelling and just to 2 Cartledge

<timemark seconds="1067" />

so I wasn't even particularly swollen I didn't have a very like inflammatory visually inflammatory arthritis so my rheumatologist who been at SickKids for 20 years said that I had the worst arthritis she never seen so it was very severe it wasn't particularly like swollen my joints just disintegrated

<timemark seconds="1090" />

wow, what do they think causes something like this eventually after the hip and ankle replacement the diagnosis was changed to juvenile idiopathic arthritis so I was literally like we don't know

<timemark seconds="1105" />

wow and how did you go from these medications pharmaceutical medications to getting into this carnivore diet thing what was this this path okay I'll give you back the path we were very like science oriented especially dad so even though mom kind of wanted to delve into diet and was like we should go sugar-free or stop eating you know whatever make sure you'd whole grains like all that stuff we never gave giant a chance because there was no scientific evidence for it

<timemark seconds="1145" />

so I basically got sicker and sicker and sicker and I ended up by the time I got to University I ended up with arthritis as severely depressed as on antidepressants as well I had idiopathic hypersomnia I was sleeping about 18 hours a day my whole body was itchy all the time that started when I was about 14 so that was when I started University and then my diet just got disastrous and University and I was like drinking all the time and eating like pizza and beer and I gained like 30 lb in the first year

<timemark seconds="1181" />

and ginger ale a lot of ginger ale anyway I gained about 30 pounds in the first year of my mental health declined even further and I didn't really know what was going on and then I started getting skin issues for started getting rashes cystic acne and I was like okay I can deal with like four really awful health problems but I can't deal with things affecting my skin on top of that there's too many things I went to dermatologist and they basically told me I was anxious and like causing these rashes by itching

<timemark seconds="1214" />

so that was the dermatologist opinion which is very unhelpful anyway I spent a lot of time as eventually prescribed Adderall for that hypersomnia so I spent all my time Google reading papers trying to get a background on skin disorders and eventually I came across this celiac disease rash online and that's what I had it looked exactly the same so I cut out gluten I read a whole bunch about like the effects of gluten on the guide and thought Oh there's actually some evidence that gluten isn't good for people why aren't people being told this like why did my doctor test me for celiac disease because celiac disease couples with autoimmune disorders all the time like they test type 1 kids for celiac disease but for some reason they don't test kids with arthritis for celiac disease gluten and that kind of help maybe like 20% but it was hard to tell because it was the summer like maybe I'm just feeling better from the summer

<timemark seconds="1270" />

my rash kind of went down but it was still there and then so the September 2015 my mom drive me to Natural path and they gave me the sheet of foods and like try this woman Asian diet I looked at the sheet and thought this doesn't make any sense like why can I eat lemons and oranges why are almonds on there but other nuts are off so I cut so I thought okay if I'm going to do an Elimination Diet which I didn't believe in at all I'll cut down to what I considered safe foods and I have no idea what I was doing so I just thought okay vegetables are pretty safe I'll get rid of nightshades cuz people talk about them being bad but next day it's like tomatoes eggplant those kind of foods for some reason there I just knew that they were I feel like literally everybody has heard them referred to as nightshades no have you heard him

<timemark seconds="1320" />

I've heard the term but not I couldn't tell you what it was I wouldn't have been able to stay with tomatoes and eggplant something to comments decide calling demons for help I cut down eating mostly like green vegetables are still eating rice that point cuz I got everybody's rice rice is safe and meet but I cut out like Dairy most grains soy sugar processed foods and then in the next month's my joints got way better than my skin healed and my skin never healed for a couple years I had always have these flare-ups and never went away and that was just on a like relatively low carb diet just like just less I don't know I was still eating rice right

<timemark seconds="1380" />

but I was still mostly meat and vegetables and I thought okay maybe there's something to this and then I made almond flour gluten-free sugar-free dairy-free almond flour banana muffins and ate a bunch of those one night and I woke up in the next day my wrists were sore and I thought

<timemark seconds="1401" />

okay maybe that's weird and then I had a bunch more than muffins because the muffins were good and then I went away to a cottage that weekend and I can walk cuz of my knees and I never had flare ups that badly like I used to get my shoulder was always sore when I slapped so I took Tylenol 3 at night for sleeping and my wrists were Steph but I never had like a flare up like I couldn't walk so I was at weekend so then I went back to the diet and got really strict with it and then things were better like my skin was better I I lost this was weird I lost 5 lb which wasn't a lot but I went down to three pant sizes so is all bloating that I didn't realize was bloating cuz it never fluctuated that was the first month and then 2015 and I start trying to reintroduce Foods because I was having cravings and I missed going out to eat with my friends and everything

<timemark seconds="1460" />

so I tried to read the first thing I tried to reintroduce was Sour Patch candy because I was having really intense sugar to look at me like that I was having really intense sugar Cravings I look at the package and I thought okay no one's allergic to put sugar there's no Dairy there's no gluten there's no soy this will be fine and I really wanted to eat them and I had those and the next day my whole body was itchy again it was like like mosquito bites everywhere itchy

<timemark seconds="1492" />

bye. Okay maybe maybe that was a bad idea I waited a couple weeks and I try to reintroduce almond butter organic almond butter cuz I wanted something fast protein fast and then I had slight abdominal cramping diarrhea then the Stitch came back so for the next year

<timemark seconds="1514" />

well I'll slow down we got some time that was that was the almond butter so then I waited a while and I felt pretty good this was November 2015 and then I started feeling really good and I went off of my anti-depressants and I had been taking antidepressant since I was in grade 5 a really high dose of an SSRI which had been very helpful but when yourself off and did you do it under a doctor supervision I didn't so I went down to half and then I went to a quarter and then I went to return there's nothing really I didn't have withdrawal symptoms like

<timemark seconds="1557" />

at this point was I was eating rice occasionally but it was mostly like broccoli salad chicken and beef fish olive oil apple cider vinegar salt pepper at that point I was also eating pears and apples so it was kind of like paleo kind of very restricted paleo dairy-free you're off your medication your joints feel better no more rashes I was shocked when the depression left it because I thought that runs in my family that's familiar we have some sort of brain chemistry problem that that can't possibly be diet I thought I thought the skin maybe that was Diet because it's gluten link and then maybe cuz of the Celiac Gene that I got tested for maybe the arthritis was part of that but I never thought mood was associated with it that was a surprise in November

<timemark seconds="1616" />

anyway I went off of the antidepressants and then about a month later I tried to reintroduce soy and this is when things started getting really weird that year so I was having reintroducing things if you having all these positive benefits I was having cravings like crazy and I would miss eating out and I thought there were probably like four or five foods I was really sensitive to and I if I could just figure out what they were I could eat pretty normally

<timemark seconds="1644" />

I didn't realize like I didn't know what was going on if I had known I would have done it much different but I tried to reintroduce story cuz at that point I still thought so I was a health food

<timemark seconds="1656" />

so I ate a huge meal of like edamame beans and bean sprouts and miso soup that I made myself so it was gluten free and soy sauce and tofu I literally ate before him and I had

<timemark seconds="1671" />

the same kind of reaction with almond butter I had immediately got bloated and diarrhea like within maybe 20-30 minutes of eating it I thought okay that sucks I guess I can't eat soy and then about 4 hours later my old legs got itchy and then my whole body got itchy and I was like okay that sucks I'm clearly in reaction to Soy and then the next morning the depression came back and it came back like that was the worst depressive experience I've ever had I was medication free and it came back in the morning and I got in the shower and I just like I balled in the shower and thought how could I be so naive to think that my horrible autoimmune disorder and depression and everything was caused by food and what an idiotic thing to think how can I be that helpful

<timemark seconds="1721" />

and I had to remind myself okay I know you ate a whole bunch of this food then you had this like digestive distress then you got itchy and now the depression is back there's clearly a pattern here but was hard to think like that when I got that depressed that day was like I spent a lot of that Jay crying then the next day got worse and this is this is when it gets weird so that night I went over to my parents and I was just like I don't know what's going on right and they're like well John take the car back to your apartment I said I don't think I can drive like I can't I just can't think I don't know what's going on so just my brother drove me home and I was like on the verge of having a panic attack for no reason writers just like my heart rate was increasing I was trying to find my keys and I turned around to look at my brother

<timemark seconds="1773" />

in the car and

<timemark seconds="1776" />

his head was a like a kind of a demon but he had like a demon had for about a second-and-a-half and he looked at me and then turned and it was my brother again so I was standing up for like about a second-and-a-half that year yes before that no yeah after this

<timemark seconds="1803" />

I'll get into it and started tripping days later

<timemark seconds="1809" />

I know how it sounds that's how it sounded to me to have you found comprable stories online obviously I did as much as I could possibly do to avoid no to gluten to people who are schizophrenic from gluten yeah they're people with celiac disease who have schizophrenia induced by gluten so I found that but I didn't find anything for other Foods

<timemark seconds="1835" />

but it's good to schizophrenia include hallucinations I rarely visual but I did find a case study of a woman who was seeing demons from her celiac disease gluten when you say you looked over and you saw your brother and his head was a demon head like describe it like

<timemark seconds="1855" />

no I found no it was like you know when it's really dark in a room and I don't know if you've experienced this what is really dark in the room and then you can kind of see things in the dark it was more like that it was dark at night and it was like I was so anxious that you just caused yourself too well so they said yeah I mean I saw it like I can remember what it looks like but it wasn't a vivid demon or something it was like but it was there that's not good so I find my keys and I go upstairs and then I went into my bedroom and like shut the blinds turn on all the lights and then like smoke as much weed as I could possibly smoke to try and calm myself down and then hid under the blankets all night I would be the worst thing to do and Take On Me.

<timemark seconds="1915" />

okay so then I spent the next couple of weeks basically stoned because I didn't know when it was going to end I didn't know what was going on and I couldn't find anybody on the internet who had the same experience as me

<timemark seconds="1928" />

and then about two and a half weeks later it started going away

<timemark seconds="1933" />

and so you say you mean the depression depression the arthritis it wasn't just the depression that, that's just went back to the initial diet I was eating so essentially just this one meal this one great meal of so I threw you off for a couple weeks rather like 3 weeks but after 2 weeks is started getting better but the symptoms were like so this deplorable the itching started I had bloating and then the depression came back and then about a week later my skin started breaking out and then maybe 10 days later my arthritis came back

<timemark seconds="1975" />

I wrote All My symptoms down every day because I was going crazy I didn't know what was going on and I wanted to write it down to see what was going on and I start feeling better again and I was like okay thank God that's over and then waited wild things are good again my symptoms went away and then over the next year I tried to reintroduce food over and over and over again and I was making like I tried whey protein powder and that did not nothing ever got to as bad as that so I experienced but I had a number of other experiences where it was the worst depression I've ever experienced and it was on the verge of

<timemark seconds="2017" />

seeing like I don't know seeing faces in things all these health issues how do you get to the carnivore diet where I decide hey maybe I don't want to keep cycling in and out of all horrible autoimmune mental problems maybe I'll just stick with the original diet and then I got pregnant

<timemark seconds="2038" />

and so then my autoimmune symptoms flared again as soon as I found out I was pregnant it was like before I found out I was pregnant that my autoimmune symptoms came back so with my legs are itchy again I was my joints worst if my skin was breaking out my anxiety was back and it was hard to tell well what part of this is pregnancy and what part of this is an autoimmune disorder so throughout my pregnancy I cut down on all the carbs I was eating so I cut up fruit and cut out sweet potatoes I went down to meet and greens I think Dad was on here one time he was on the green side that was during that part we're both on him and Grains diet mostly because we didn't realize you didn't need grains to survive

<timemark seconds="2084" />

so we're eating mean grants

<timemark seconds="2086" />

and then I had to say mostly because we realize you didn't need to realize only need one of those meeting salad was very simple salad like olive oil apple cider vinegar salt pepper cucumbers lettuces spinach pretty simple salad and we did that for about a year and then I had my daughter and then I didn't get better so then I found out okay so these symptoms aren't really pregnancy-related it's just me now for some reason I've lost the Taurus to these Foods I used to be able to eat

<timemark seconds="2126" />

and in salad and me and I'm still having autoimmune so now it's symptoms but I wasn't back my anxiety was manageable without medication or you had an achieve the levels of the I didn't know that you had earlier yeah exactly exactly like I reached a really good point and then I got pregnant I couldn't reach that point again so then this is 2017 so its like November and I'm getting really frustrated about being itchy I'm just randomly itchy again randomly arthritic knee and salad yeah and I thought okay maybe I just have an autoimmune disorder and I can't control it anymore maybe this maybe I'm just stuck like this and so I Googled like out of desperation I think I Googled allergic to everything food-wise something like that into Google I found the store

<timemark seconds="2186" />

about Charlene Anderson who's been mentioned a couple times and she been diagnosed with Lyme disease and it's been eating nothing but like red meat for 18 years their pictures of her family online and I thought okay I know I'm not I think I Googled allergic to everything except meat sword on her then I found that Sean Baker episode you did and she's been doing it for 2 years and I think that night I thought screw it I literally have nothing to lose here I'm only cutting out salad so that's when I switched over I was just a number and then I switched over and the itching got better pretty quickly like within the first couple of days but then my digestion just got totally screwed up so like bloating and diarrhea everytime I eat and after about a week I thought K this is a bad idea obviously

<timemark seconds="2244" />

just me just mean and salt roast yeah so I thought this is a bad idea obviously this isn't working my body doesn't like it so I reintroduce salad again it was literally lettuce apple cider vinegar olive oil and salt and pepper that's what I reintroduce and I woke up the next day and the itch was back in my joints were Steph and I thought okay if I have to choose between itching and arthritis or diarrhea I'm going to choose the diarrhea I was in a rough place so I stuck it out and at 6 weeks of just doing this my dad the bloating went away the diarrhea went away and everything started to improve

<timemark seconds="2286" />

Chihuahuas mid-January but are still pretty skeptical because I thought I thought maybe the reason the carnivore diet work for people with because they just accidentally cut out everything that wasn't working for them processed food sugar no grains all that all lives like organic olive oil that was February and then I had this itching came back with the depression my skin broke out and it was minor in comparison to like soy to give us the cliff notes you're allergic to everything

<timemark seconds="2321" />

yeah

<timemark seconds="2323" />

event parking crazy

<timemark seconds="2325" />

it's crazy but then here's the thing I started this blog so the blogs don't eat that I started this blog because I thought if for some reason there's someone else out there like me and they're Googling these things it be nice for them to know that you're not alone and I found other people like this who are you khaliyah sensitive I'm sure it makes sense that we all have different tolerances we all have different allergies me some people are allergic to cat some people have no problem with peanuts some people eat a Brazil nut made I just know this so the idea this is one of the problems with diet is that people want to think that a diet that works for them works for everybody and it doesn't work that way and things and people want you to follow their diet no matter what it is but it's vegan or paleo people are very ideological with that would love you for you to do

<timemark seconds="2385" />

there's a lot of pushback against this carnivore diet idea but I don't I don't think it's outside the realm of possibility that someone like you might actually really be allergic to everything I was very sick and from coming from that place to now I can see how sick I was and it was like I was dying. But a bunch of medication did you ever do anything with probiotics that maybe I'm saying and then maybe incorporate more foods do that same autoimmune flare up

<timemark seconds="2428" />

okay but this is the same Autumn immune flare up that you got when you eat salad

<timemark seconds="2433" />

no not quite as bad. It was different it was like with salad there's more of the arthritis and like body pain and then with probiotics what you got till like really volatile answer the probiotics just going everywhere brought up to me when he was here was the most fires then I started reading up on it after discuss it with me and something I've never even considered before but fast rising yeast and all these different emulsifiers that they put in and bread and various foods are terrible for you oh my God yeah terrible through stomach in there they're so prevalent they're everywhere

<timemark seconds="2493" />

in a couple of studies it's it's crazy how this is something that's never even disgusting and it has all sorts of negative effects on your gut in your gut lining so yeah combining that and then it looks like grains aren't so good for people combining that and Grains is no wonder people are ill some people you know some people do you look like obesity or some I mean okay say I mean I guess not I'm not a great example but I mean people start gaining weight if they're lucky when they're middle-aged if they're on Lucky winner around 25 and they start gaining weight I don't think it's from lack of exercise I think it's from diet and for sure but it's also lack of exercise

<timemark seconds="2553" />

people who've gone on to this carnivore diet especially lose that weight that don't follow the carnivore diet so how to explain that wow I'd like to see anybody above the age of 50 Below on a standard standard American diet I need you to watch these blanket statements are real issue and that's one of the reasons why you are diet is fascinating because like you know I don't think you can make blanket statements when it comes to people and diet and now that I think there's some people out there that have God damn food downstairs you can throw everything in there and they're fine they just don't they don't seem to have issues that I'm dealing with my brother

<timemark seconds="2603" />

is pretty well he's not so good with a like lactose but he's pretty stable compared to me anyway announce the Retro fucking checked is no problems at all is not fat and said that but that's an issue of enormous like expenditure of energy me he's losing his body has ridiculous Carly calorie requirements but I think send Terry Lifestyles a giant part of it most most of all people do is what we're doing right now most of the people do is sit down but is that because they don't feel like running around because I put in a little bit of effort to make yourself go exercise but a lot of people who are overweight and sick

<timemark seconds="2657" />

don't have enough energy to do that some of them maybe but I think some of them just don't have discipline there's an issue with that as well is also an issue with momentum you're not used to doing it it's not a part of your life it's not something to your custom to pushing yourself there's been many many many many many many many days where I didn't want to work out I just didn't feel like I have the energy and I just force myself and I think there's very few people out there that know how to force themselves that's a learn that's a learned skill it's all got that that kind of discipline and focus you have to have like real rigid requirements of yourself where you don't allow yourself to back out of things and you don't allow yourself to slack off and I don't think people put those kind of requirements on themselves as if it's it is a daily principle of life like what you must get done you know you must brush your teeth and if you did that I think you'd be healthy

<timemark seconds="2717" />

in happier and you your body would perform more smoothly and you if you require your body to do things like that I think it rises to the occasion there very few people that have that kind of discipline so because of that they come up with excuses and excuses are a giant part of the problem it's not simply a physical health issue there's also mental aspects of it and disciplines a big one I just know way too many people who are weak mentally and I can't I can't just chalk it off to only you know their physical they're the way they physically feel because I felt like shit a hundred times and I worked out and I felt way better just it's just a fact of life that's real you know you just got to the people don't know how to do that it's not all and if you're used to doing that getting your car sit down drive to the office sit down go to the lunch sit down and I'll go to the board meeting sit-down getting your car on the way home sit down get home in front of the TV sit down then go to the gym fuck off tonight

<timemark seconds="2777" />

energy you know that their body is not the device like I don't have it in me to do this and I don't believe that I don't believe that I think it's it's a lot of it is the mindset but because and I know I'm like I was a very sick individual differences real legitimate diagnosed physical issues this this is a very different autoimmune disorder I mean listen you get your hip replaced your fucking 17 that's crazy you don't hear that this is different than talking about the average fat fuck just sitting around being lazy that's really what it is it's like I'm sure a lot of it is diet and a lot of that diet affects their physical health but there's been many many people that have just put their foot down and said enough I'm going to change my life and they've they don't take any excuses and they feel way way better diet is most certainly a part of that but there's also a discipline aspect and these things are not mutually exclusive they

<timemark seconds="2837" />

just together they're all together there's any work symbiotically the way you your your mindset affects the choices you make with your diet and the mindset also affects the choices you make in terms of like whether not you require yourself to exercise and I think these are these are critical aspects that people like to gloss over would you like to make excuses about and they get very angry if you don't accept those excuses and that's a sign that they're trying to they're trying to enforce this standard in this idea and push it on you and give themselves an excuse it's one of the reasons why they get angry I just want things if someone has a legit physical issue like you do but there's a lot of people who do not have poor diet choices they have a sedentary lifestyle and they have the momentum of the sedentary lifestyle is holding them back their their customed to being lazy

<timemark seconds="2890" />

okay

<timemark seconds="2891" />

I kind of a kind of great I just from like my perspective I see my dad and he was very like you can see from the videos from 2014 before he started going low carb and everything he was caring about 50 extra pounds and he didn't exercise and he didn't have enough energy to exercise true well yeah but you yourself through that you don't have to do a lot to do something you walk uphill you jump a little rough you take a little tiny kettlebell you do a couple cleans and presses you do a few push-ups to do sit-ups you get your blood pumping you moving you're alive you're exercising to say you don't have enough energy to exercise that's crazy can you walk to the refrigerator then you can exercise I'm not saying that you have to run marathons you can exercise and everyone should fucking exercise

<timemark seconds="2951" />

don't ever say these people are so crazy they said they did want you to believe I don't have the energy to exercise God damn it everyone does if you're a liar you're going to have your size that I've been expressing my dad there and then here's the thing once he fixed up his diet once he went to this carnivore diet he's exercising now shut down to the felt shittier for sure when it fell as good as you feeling now but to give people as excuse I don't have the energy to exercise that is crazy to say can you walk to the fucking refrigerator yes will you can exercise you don't have to do anything crazy just walk around the block there's an 80 year old ladies and take yoga with me they're they're fucking really old and they're in there they're going after they can easily say I don't have the energy to do that but they don't it's a mental attitude to make a decision yeah I agree and like there's a lot of it is disappointing you're going to get people who just got back

<timemark seconds="3011" />

how to kill yourself you have to go to a CrossFit class and try to do the workout of the day you have to go nuts and do clean presses 150 lb requirements it wants to move it really doesn't want it does you feel better but people like to give themselves as it's cute I do not have the energy to do this whatever if you decide that that's true but if you watch a motivational video this is a hundred of them on YouTube thousand even go watch one you get fired up you like fucking I'm going to jump some rope you jump to do something just do some push-ups do something just bodyweight squats you'll feel better

<timemark seconds="3048" />

it's also like learning that learning that and having that as a part of your daily life it has to be and I can't I'm not talking on someone like you who is in the throes of this autoimmune disorder where you're getting hip replace it 17 I'm not talking about someone would like serious degenerative illness I'm talking about just a regular person is overweight you can do it there's a lady was like 450 lb with me she's in there she's probably really embarrassing very hard to do you know and she's in there any way to do it we can do it and I can't I'm not saying I'm just saying just do something got to do something we have fucked up Lifestyles to sit down all day and it certainly not designed to be stuck in traffic and be in an office and just be fluorescent lights in front of a computer monitor watch your soul gets sucked through the LCD screen

<timemark seconds="3108" />

it's crazy yeah I agree I think we got to be really careful with just the way we describe things just like to say I don't have the energy to do something with to fuck off stop I don't know if I believe it still was good but I'm still not convinced you change your diet a lot of people do yeah but not as partly that's discipline but partly that's being able to

<timemark seconds="3141" />

I'm still at I don't know you haven't been completely in the back

<timemark seconds="3147" />

so I think if you're carrying around extra weight like a quite a bit of extra weight and you say I don't have enough energy there's something serious going on but isn't just so I have a few extra pounds and I don't think we know exactly what that looks like a lot of it has to do with energy I mean dad was sleeping you're sleeping for 2 hours a day in the middle of the day and he was impossible to wake up he couldn't wake up I'd like to shake them told me he was on a standard diet of the likes sandwiches and pasta things on those lines but I mean most people who don't have enough energy are in a lot of those people don't realize like we were eating whole grains we didn't know that whole grains were Just Grains we got the whole grains were healthy so I was having sandwiches for lunch because I was having cheese and bread and that was protein

<timemark seconds="3207" />

it was very significant.

<timemark seconds="3211" />

I think you know it's hard to do it's hard to also figure out what is depression depression like myself I hear that and I go okay what does that mean yeah I mean you feel bad what does it mean does it mean there's like a thick wet blanket over your life that you can't get out of there's a couple of things the closest it's a it's impossible to think of when you're not depressed but the closest I've get to is if you're in a really really stressful situation and a whole bunch of things go wrong at the same time that stress you feel is kind of like a really really mild version of being depressed being depressed is like if you look at something the colors seem muted you don't get joy out of anything sky like just tell her everything's in grayscale kind of feels like you're walking through molasses and then you have a whole bunch of anxieties pop up all the time that are like worst case

<timemark seconds="3271" />

Mario's of everything in your entire life that won't happen but that's all you can think of all the time that's in the partly anxiety but it's hell like I having arthritis I choose arthritis a million times over then this depression just Rex you

<timemark seconds="3290" />

so what leads you to the carnivore diet this lady is been living on it for 18 years you read about her and that she's still alive without eating and she looks great is a before and after picture she loves taking vitamins as well nothing nothing even salt so this is what you hear it so this anecdotal story is what leads you to give that a try and yeah this is 17 so December, so craving to hang in there with 6 weeks diarrhea miso soup I love and then after 6 weeks you got better and then I ran to the Stalls now

<timemark seconds="3350" />

okay I'm done with you I'm just sticking with me

<timemark seconds="3357" />

yeah we'll see how that goes

<timemark seconds="3360" />

He seems to be weirdly sensitive to like in the same category as me but instead of getting arthritis and all these other things as well he just gets the depression which is the worst one. And you didn't sleep for like 24 days sulfites in apple cider in a stew I made I don't know what it was I think that's what it was and yeah and then there was the itching came back in the Doom came in this depression came in and then that's that's weird and it hasn't happened very many times but I got stuck with insomnia and it felt like we weren't sleeping probably out like but I'm sure you know it's not physically possible to stay away for that long but didn't feel like sleeping what's the world record that someone's ever stayed awake I think it's only like 10 days

<timemark seconds="3420" />

something along those lines God why would he do that was it just a test 25 minutes

<timemark seconds="3435" />

wow that's crazy so I was your dad must unless you Dad Stomp the shit out of that world record no I'm sure he was sleeping but it was very much it's just crazy that one thing what would you remember what it was to be reintroduced to his diet that might have been it wasn't an option it was we were just still eating apples at that point and it was a cider and it had sulfites added and I looked at it and thought whatever it's like parts per million sulfites it'll be fine

<timemark seconds="3467" />

and then that was the only thing that was new so do you think that as you get on to this Elimination Diet and you start taking things out and I can get more sensitive to things that I noticed in in a big way when I cut sugar out of my diet if I have sugar now like if I go crazy and have an ice cream sundae I hit a fucking wall so hard where I can get up sit down the couch my it takes like an hour or two for it to get out of my system so for like an hour to sit there and feel like shit and then 2 hours later 2 hours 2 hours just like 24 days for me for 2 hours I mean and again it's not I'm not depressed for 2 hours I just feel like I have a brick in my stomach feel like I'm on a tranquilizer

<timemark seconds="3527" />

is idiopathic hypersomnia like I was falling asleep during exams I drove home on the highway one time when I was 22 and I was falling asleep at the wheel and I was like oh my God like I can't stay awake I'm passing out and I moved over until Lane in a truck came by and honk at me and I was like oh my God I'm going to die and then I went on adderal I need to stay awake or I'm going to die did you get our if you ever all oh yeah yeah I'm off of everything and they are all so I stopped taking the immune suppressants when I cut out gluten just to see how my arthritic flare-ups would go if anything would happen then I was done I got off of the antidepressants November 2015 and then my fatigue lifted in January 2016 so I got off right away then

<timemark seconds="3577" />

I was taking a lot and it was great when I was in that like feeling like I was on tranquilizers it was great but once you don't need it it's kind of awful being on that amount of amphetamine all the time how many people are on that shit it's so disturbing to me how many people are are taken out in there to talk about their productivity and they're always makes you more productive and it just destroys your short-term memory destroyed mine I was taking 40 mg a day on the morning long release have always thought about trying I'm like maybe one day if you have it you have it I don't think he gives you to kick like if you're exhausted all the time it's just kind of unpleasant and it makes you like weirdly antisocial

<timemark seconds="3629" />

okay so you haven't been on this diet for a year what what has the change once you got over the diarrhea

<timemark seconds="3638" />

what has the change been like this and like the autoimmune stuff went away fairly quickly when I was still having diarrhea and I want a way to pick up six weeks into the diet and then in May so I've been December Jennifer March April May so 5 months into it I had a huge Improvement so things just got better and better every day and I finally got to the point where I was pre-pregnancy so since May

<timemark seconds="3669" />

besides I would say it's still getting better so it's only been 3 months so you've been okay since January but my mood went from Leica to like a nine and a half great in May 1st feeling good after I start it after the first 6 weeks

<timemark seconds="3688" />

but then things got a lot better in May seems to be just improving what kind of blood work are you getting why you doing all this so you are you going and getting tested for nutritional deficiencies cuz the one of the issues that many people who are nutritionists or who are studying biology have with his carnivore diet is that meat just meet is very deficient in many many nutrients it's just it's very deficient in vitamin C deficiency several things that we think that you need in order to to live well I did get blood work done because people were asking and not because I particularly trust blood work because my blood work was always pretty normal I was I was going to zinc and vitamin D since I was a kid yeah everything was normal I had no blood markers and I was like dying what about for inflammation my white blood cell count was high

<timemark seconds="3748" />

was high my vitamin D in my eyes and Grelot you got your blood tested and they showed you have a high white blood cell count they would go there's an issue here abnormal enough to have caused the problems I was experiencing different was it from the norm white blood cell counts had white blood cells raise white blood cell count and I had white blood cells in my urine when that's that's a little weird because that is generally like well some sort of bacterial infection which I didn't have symptoms of so that was a little weird but that was never focused on from the doctors that seems like that's that's an issue if normal people don't have that you have problems the normal people don't have I would say like your blood work is not my it mean if your blood work is not normal that's not normal

<timemark seconds="3808" />

so I was kind of at a standstill when you said that you don't trust blood work and then but I did get it done so everybody could say I wasn't dying I can pull it up that was one of the issues with Sean Baker Sean got his blood work done and one of the things that people notice is that there's quite a few issues there and one of them was very very low testosterone which is crazy cuz he's a gorilla yeah he's a big huge 6 foot 5 250 lb dude so it's like well he don't look deficient in testosterone like what the hell's going on here I don't have testosterone Mighty nahin I have gone back and forth about this he said part of that might have been that had to do with taking the test when he had done like a very heavy weight lifting workout the day before I get done squats deadlifts and all kinds of stuff and so maybe broke his body down a bit to take some of these groups of people doing this diet and just do a study so we could ask

<timemark seconds="3868" />

some information instead of when I put my stuff up but just because so I can show it to you but everything is normal everything is normal my ferritin is slightly slightly elevated but like people iron not necessarily and it was still like my doctor said he didn't care it was an elevated enough but like what about vitamins so for vitamins

<timemark seconds="3905" />

vitamins my sink is still low my vitamin D still low but hasn't recovered it's been like that for like done from Green because there's no light for like 6 months and so I'm probably deficient

<timemark seconds="3928" />

I think that has something to do with the autoimmune disorder I tried supplementing with really high dose vitamin D and didn't see any benefits

<timemark seconds="3937" />

trust me I don't take any more the high dose vitamin D I tried once when I was 21 for about a year and then again when I was doing a low-carb diet what about now when your issues with vitamin D or in your blood work Monday I'll just recommend supplementing with a normal dose of vitamin D I think I'm just going to wait and see and get tested in the year I'm not too concerned and see what happened because he hears was interesting when I went to the low carb diet my B vitamins were low so this was during my pregnancy I got this first test and it was my B12 was fine but everything else was low it was B1 B3 B6 and biotin

<timemark seconds="3989" />

we're all low on a low-carb diet my naturopath said maybe you have a microphone problem whatever that means yeah what else is like me to Crystal in your pocket at all times

<timemark seconds="4008" />

I know what they were there telling me to cut out gluten for years and I was like what do you know I could have probably stopped up your bed I don't help

<timemark seconds="4023" />

anyway vitamin D and Cat not calcium vitamin D and zinc are still low but all my bees have gone up so none of my B's folate is still borderline but it was deficient before and all my other bees are have gone up to normal with all is normal she hasn't changed at all or deficient if you are on the style it because I thought people died of scurvy if it any vegetables just like everybody thinks that but it turns out vitamin C and glucose compete so if you don't eat glucose you just don't use as much vitamin C

<timemark seconds="4075" />

and I haven't been supplementing but my vitamin C's totally fine Sean bigger something something about that something along those lines that are some of the vitamin C that you're taking in is competing with glucose and that you need far less of it and it's far more effective so there is some vitamin C and beef grass-fed beef or you do care I tried to get rid of all the variables cuz I didn't know what I was reacting to so I was eating grass and all that stuff and now I'm eating mostly I try to stay away from the antibiotic and hormone me but I'm eating grain finish because it's just so much cheaper than grass-fed and it doesn't I have no problems with it how would you know if antibiotics or hormones in it you just trust the labeling that's it but I but I've gone out to eat in restaurants where I'm sure the meats lower-quality and I haven't had an autoimmune flare up with that

<timemark seconds="4131" />

so when you go out to eat you know what two things you post the other day was that you had a steak that had pepper on it ground pepper and you're freaking out I was freaking out Monday yeah but I don't know what happens it's okay I'm fine but if it gives you enough time to freak out about if they're going to happen for a couple days and then it's like a month of an autoimmune disorder and depression and brain fog is horrible I'm freaked out but I'm okay it's the one thing I found really helps the only thing I found it helps these reactions is an infrared sauna if I get in there like once a day and sweat what about a regular one do you know elevated heat temperature weather temperature or not

<timemark seconds="4191" />

effects of infrared but I have been studies from Finland that show the decrease in mortality of 40% of regular please there's a start maybe Rhonda Patrick has it up on our website but cuz I asked her whether I should get a regular sauna or a infrared and she said the study that we're done we're done with a regular sauna but she said that the real issue is that your body is producing heat shock proteins so whether temporary or regular the hole but the real issue is your body's in this extreme 170 degree temperature reduces the cytokines and these cytokines cytokines on my mind and your body is reacting to the incredible temperature and this is what produces anti-inflammation affect how a thing for someone like you with arthritis in particular anything that reduces inflammation would be great

<timemark seconds="4251" />

that so yeah I know it's song the awesome I just if I'm reacting like Sonic makes me feel like 20% better like a lot better when I get in and it's nice but it's not like a huge relief like it is when I'm reacting issues that you have but for me it's just it's a game changer in there for 20 minutes half hour and I get out of there it's just like everything just feels better after I get out I get this mood up temperature normalizes your body temperature normal size is after out of that heat and then everything just like yeah I know it's great yeah not as good I don't think but somewhere feeling it's better actually for pain so I have my ankle replacement still gives me problems because it's an ankle replacement so I've done

<timemark seconds="4311" />

therapy for that and that's works better for pain I think in the sauna does what do they do when they replace your ankle do they cut off the bottom of the joint and recap it and put something else there so yeah they caught us the bottom of the tibia so big bone tibia and then they replace the top of the talus it sucks and I got it done in 2009 when the ankle joint weren't as good as they are now so now I'm left with this like old ankle joint and I'm 26 so I have to get it looked at because it's giving me problems. I think they're just going to try and fix that it's super dope carbon fiber new model they don't have that nobody's like making anything cool now it seems like they're constantly improving that I mean that looks like on YouTube that that's not really what it looks like in real life

<timemark seconds="4371" />

no I was like maybe I could just get a new foot I can get a better foot right

<timemark seconds="4382" />

depends on the robot foot down for Real by foot if it took away all your pain oh my God yeah if I could run again I can try but they five friends of got a hip replacement they said Runnings out of the question of the idea but there's no way can't run forever please don't give me no problems it's great but I thought that the load that is placed on the hip is not I don't think they recommend activities like that even like what's an elliptical I got pretty low in the hot and I can't do that cuz of my ankle but my hip is fine. Was it an angled like a beam with handles on it and you do this it's amazing

<timemark seconds="4442" />

cuz you're at an angle so you got your kind of planking almost a little bit while you're doing it while I'm 20 seconds on 10 second break 20 seconds on 10 second break phenomenal cardio now I can't really do anything with this ankle but I did start it yeah it's a huge fan I am I'm going to need to get surgery I think I'm getting something done in January into the joint so it's basically fused so I just don't have any movement and it kind of hurts and doesn't hurt like it hurt when I needed it replaced but it hurts

<timemark seconds="4492" />

so they're going to go in and clean out all the bone and pray that that works

<timemark seconds="4497" />

Jesus said that that's what my January is going to be if you got on this diet when you were younger you could have avoided all this shit are they not me didn't know about that they could have said I don't know they could have went to the Celiac thing then I would have at least include in that gluten was a problem and maybe just removing that would have been good enough what would seems the the amount of research that they would have to do I mean think about how many different things you had to look at to come to that conclusion the time you had to spend a night in Canada has Public Enemy you have public health care right so it's it's weird right it did not as motivated

<timemark seconds="4538" />

they're not it's not ideal for people with very special problems general public if you don't have money and you need to get taken care of but they have a lot of people coming in and out right is constant I'm getting the surgery done in North Carolina fucking turn your back on there is for a surgeon that's not as good

<timemark seconds="4565" />

yeah that infrared thing I'm finding it very interesting stuff so I remember reading what you said but I'm not finding that and I've only found stuff that kind of Ben Greenfield I think it was a transcription of a podcast to do with Rhonda and something else very similar information from dr. Joel Kahn that says only sunlight sunlight and far infrared saunas have been shown to increase core temperature for Effective detoxification because they get you can stay longer in the freshly or they want to run a hundred and thirty degrees you can be there till after 45 minutes or so I guess you can't unless you can withstand it ammo and regular heat one for the team that are around you not light heating your body so the infrared one is heating your body and specific rather than you being in the heat correct interested

<timemark seconds="4625" />

what how much longer how long you supposed to do for at least 30 minutes but that's what I do anyway I don't know the difference it seems like you get more benefit with less suffering that's what it would seem like cuz you could do it longer I think that's what they're getting at but I don't know if that's the reason why I quit after 20 minutes and I can't get to the 30th well people do man the kid does get uncomfortable with it but if you could have if you get the same benefits and you could avoid the discomfort why wouldn't you do that right right before you start sweating and I'm really hot and then you start sweating in your snot is bad company that's making an infrared saw that you workout in it's got a chin-up bar in and it's got all these like like resistance cables and have to go more into science is that I don't know

<timemark seconds="4685" />

can't just heat at eating up your skin it's not let it like infrared is literally a wave hits a light wave it's a different kind of mitochondria the studies that they did in was it in Norway maybe they just didn't have infrared there maybe I don't know cuz like those Russian Banya as they do the regular song of these regular song is Inigo hot cold hot cold and they've had some pretty awesome benefits of that there might be something to that because they're using light dentist use to harden feeling so pretty new yeah science She Blinded Me With Science fascinating stuff is all very fascinating stuff but definitely helps you either way yeah yeah and I think like I've read some studies on it working out of mitochondria level I don't know anything about it I'm just there's something to it and it after about half-an-hour is the only thing that's helped

<timemark seconds="4745" />

I've tried like I won't try everything to get rid of these reactions faster like detoxification things or mostly just different weird different sort of detoxification things and nothing's helping suffice on a Stihl last for as long but then I was awful so I was telling you that this guy Kevin bass PhD in a scientist and he contacted me and I contacted him put on my glasses and he we went back and forth about this online and so he sent me a bunch of stuff what he thinks and one of them is nutrient deficiency

<timemark seconds="4790" />

and immunosuppression from a nutrient deficiency and that in the ideas that may be in having less nutrients and having less did the UE dietary immunosuppression via deficiency

<timemark seconds="4812" />

might be helping you oh and he said basically crazier things have happened and that you reported still having symptoms when you get sick even on a carnivore diet and he said that it shows that the carnivore diet that is symptomatic treatment it's not because she's remove the offending antigen

<timemark seconds="4831" />

yeah I don't even know if I understood all that properly this is a very long he's a very very long piece on this and I appreciate that you took the time to do this one of things they saying it's like vitamin A that this this that this guy could be vitamin A deficient vitamin C deficiency we went over that vitamin K deficiency

<timemark seconds="4857" />

so you got your results back so you got tested and I vitamin K everything's good as normal vitamin A is normal 30 is okay for vitamin K2 mines 40 everything about 70s okay for vitamin A mind 79 he said also that a lot of your symptoms including joint destruction fatigue depression Exedra can be caused by the drugs that are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis

<timemark seconds="4892" />

was that how do you test without post on those medications for those studies even done how do you test if the drugs are the arthritis causing it take on this potential scenarios to me without rejecting it totally you were on those drugs far far or earlier than your joints destroyed right grade 11 or The Replacements this whole thing is a very fascinating subject because people are not having the response that nutritionist would like them to have a nutritionist would like you guys to be freaking out and falling apart and everybody seems to be doing well I have a friend of mine lives in San Diego to spend on the carnivore diet for a while and you know he's Navy SEAL so I feel fucking fantastic you just tried it out see what it was like he's never felt better in his whole life

<timemark seconds="4950" />

yeah elimination diets this is this is a big thing like getting getting yourself down to a very small number of foods

<timemark seconds="4961" />

you know and that this seems to have some sort of a large benefit for people's well I mean I think it would depend on the foods you looks like your body not having too much to manage and that people with autoimmune disorders and diseases having less to manage could potentially be what what is benefiting you as well I don't like his last though cuz if you survive only off of soy you're not going to do well I think it depends what you're eating when you get sick the systemic inflammation probably opens up your intestinal barrier which causes auto immune system to kick in again and said the same thing happens with any food that causes your intestinal Barry to open up he said why is this happening I don't understand and that you and your father both think this could be some sort of hereditary thing have you guys done any 23andMe testing yeah and what is that app for different genes

<timemark seconds="5021" />

perhaps nothing showed up I ran it I ran it through Rhonda Patrick has something on her website right I ran it through that I ran it through Prometheus nothing shocking shows up I have the Celiac Gene dad doesn't so that's not exactly the issue that was it

<timemark seconds="5042" />

whole thing is just it's it's one of the more interesting things is how people they always want to attach all these other things to it that the environmental concerns and the concern for you know the Health and Welfare of these animals and that you're supporting factory farming and I'll be logical super fast. I'm concerned about other people who are suffering as much as I was suffering that's it before your concern with the animals and everything else if your choice is to live with an autoimmune disorder and die slowly that way

<timemark seconds="5091" />

you can do that and not even if you want to do so it's also I think a disingenuous argument because 97% of the people in the world eat meat or some such as easy to tell other people that when you're not experiencing those symptoms it's also I mean

<timemark seconds="5110" />

you definitely it's definitely easier if you're not experiencing no symptoms but there's so much meeting going on already and if if people really can benefit greatly from just an all meat diet

<timemark seconds="5125" />

you know we going to tell them don't do that go vegan and keep stopping and be covered in hives and itching and and being depressed States the rest of your life

<timemark seconds="5138" />

sisters are such a hot subject and I feel like this is something that we're going to have more insight on over the next few years you know Shawn Baker who's you know who's the physician and then you've got some really dedicated athletes that are trying it now like you know Zach bitter

<timemark seconds="5160" />

what is he on the North American record for 24 hour race or if not for 24 hours for a hundred miles to rent a hundred miles and 11 hours and 40 minutes how fucking insane it's almost nothing but meat is almost his entire diet supplements with high levels of glucose like those gels and shit like that in grams of carbs way up when he's going to do a hundred mile races and things like that but that's obviously a requirement on his body he's miles in 11 hours and 40 minutes but it's just you know his his his diet shows that it is possible to do extreme physical Feats while you're on this and he does a podcast also with John

<timemark seconds="5220" />

so this is something that people are really starting to study now and then there's a there's a lot of hesitancy you know I read some article today you criticizing you and your dad and now it's okay I find it kind of like carnivore diet get really like vegan Haiti well that's right that's true but what they were doing is there going off about the environment this is like like methane gas produced by cows good argument cuz this is this is happening like if you're a person okay I'm not saying that we don't all have a responsibility to do our part to try to save the environment but if you are person who is deathly ill you go to the supermarket this little fucking beef you can go buy beef it's right there if you could buy that beef and it fixes you what why don't you stop and think about the ecological concerns.

<timemark seconds="5280" />

are mental concerns and then the physical concerns of people that are forced to take on these fucking ridiculous pharmaceutical medications and think about your also empowering these pharmaceutical companies and their lobbying to stop natural natural cures there their they're trying to make Kratom illegal there's a lot of fuckery that's involved in pharmaceutical companies that were well aware of a lot of cherry picking studies studies one of them shows that there might be some benefit to this 99 shows if they ignore those and they're allowed to do this there's a lot of weird shit that you really should take into consideration before we support any sort of pharmaceutical alternative and pharmaceutical drugs aren't demons there's a lot of people that benefit greatly from pharmaceutical drugs I don't think I would have been able to figure this out unless I've been on Adderall and had the energy to Google from sure I mean look there's this benefits it's not there are not all

<timemark seconds="5340" />

not all good but I don't like that argument like a you know if you go on the carnivore you're contributing to methane that's fucking up the world okay is it better or worse than pharmaceutical drugs is it better or worse than what they're doing is it better or worse the fact that the pharmaceutical drug store in the water supply they know if they've done tests on reservoirs and found pharmaceutical drugs it's a pharmaceutical drugs in rivers shut the fuk up there's a lot going on here look at this you better look at it in a post about this cuz otherwise you're showing your ideological Bend like to say that it's about methane in about cows and factory farming not really know there's a lot going on a lot going on here it's this is so long and new wants discussion and if you or your painting this this article in one way and talk I'm only about the

<timemark seconds="5400" />

need help in the negative environmental concerns that are associated with beef production like that b Productions going on in Metairie with you like it or not if you think we can curb it back and slow it down a little bit that would be wonderful but we have to look at it accurately you know it also I believe they've proven that methane Google if this is true that methane production from cows make sense is far less when they're on a natural diet when they're pasture-raised then it is if their corn-fed would make sense cuz they have all sorts of all sorts of eating grain

<timemark seconds="5438" />

you got that could easily be a part of the problem is they're trying to fatten these cows up quicker and they're forcing to eat something that's not natural for the body and I've ever seen that King Corn documentary no worry about to marry but it's a real yeah it's a mind fuck everything your DNA like your whole body but filled with corn is this so much I hear that it's crazy that they've done they did these guys did tests on the carbon in their body and they found her body yeah whatever it was they just need to go through the supermarket I on the fine how many things have corn in them corn is subsidized by the government and you know

<timemark seconds="5486" />

did the Articles myth but again this is that this is also part of the problem these people were writing these articles about your diet and about your dad and and his own shot at dad other problem you certainly a lot of that I mean it would be nice if someone instead of saying maybe she didn't have arthritis or maybe she's just pussy doing herself into the store maybe it's deprivation that's making her feel better like it be nice if someone actually did a study that a new diet to reduce the amount of burping a cut Mission methane by 20% 2008 article on the inside of the couch

<timemark seconds="5535" />

okay Special Machine is used to cut the straw okay but still mixed with slatch silage wheat maze Sawyer or sugar beet which can be mixed with ya see if you Google methane by cows or pasture-raised methane by cows methane produced by cows were grass-fed cows that produce less methane which isn't what I would have guessed

<timemark seconds="5577" />

grass-fed cattle do more methane produce produce do more methane produced do more methane because it's harder to digest okay obviously do produce more methane because it's harder to digest grass and grain however some argue grass that is continually grazed by grass-fed cattle sequesters enough carbon to make up the difference in methane okay that's what it is and healthy soil keeps carbon dioxide underground and out of the atmosphere okay story behind there so that's why it's it's better for the environment they eat grass which totally makes sense because I've been eating grass for a million years

<timemark seconds="5623" />

so so here you are here you are on this diet now and you started what are you doing consulting people online what is that involve people Skype me and basically

<timemark seconds="5640" />

want to see me and how I'm still alive only eating beef

<timemark seconds="5645" />

and then asked me how to cook and things cuz nobody knows how to cook meat without anything on it well how do you cook like how do you cope with just beef they don't know what to do if oil do you use I don't use the oil I think most of these people I've been talked to a lot I used tallow

<timemark seconds="5663" />

I used a lot but most of these people are really sick and really desperate and they haven't had any help for the medical system and so far in this is completely true anybody who's gone on to this like beef and salt and water diet anybody I've seen has been able to stick through that transition. Where you like get off of carbs types of diarrhea. Everyone gets that Dad didn't get that 50/50 it looks like the sticker you are

<timemark seconds="5696" />

it seems to be but like seriously 50% of people and it seems like the sticker you are the more likely you are to get that I don't know if it's a inability to digest that amount of fat right away or if it's a microbiome switch or something but it seems to have 50% of people never 50% to switch over but everybody gets some sort of carb withdrawal especially if you go from like a standard American diet over then I'm craving you done that and I got my ketones checked and they were ridiculously high that was the breath test and then I have the urine strip test which I know aren't is accurate but I haven't gone out of ketosis my diet about 80% calories from fat so I eat ribs

<timemark seconds="5746" />

what's a really fatty I eat ribeye sometimes but I been eating more and more fat so just tell her act like I'm getting a bit 80% from the fat eating really lean meat cuz I'm eating a lot of wild team I'm not getting as much fat I'm halfway through a book called fat of the land by I'm going to butcher this but like vilhelm near Stevenson it was the dude who went to live with Inuit people in Canada for five years Mayday like they ate and it's amazing like historically it shows how they dressed and how they lived and What part of the animal they ate and so he lived off of what they which was basically just meet and sometimes eggs for 5 years and then he came back I don't know if he was in England or in the states that he came back and said hey look how healthy I am all I eat is meat soon like the 30th and they said no way you're supposed to have scurvy

<timemark seconds="5806" />

so him and his partner who is his last names Anderson went to Bellevue Hospital and they stayed under monitor just eating meat for a year and there are six studies done on them and you can find them online and they monitored like vitamin levels the amount of driver everything because kidney function because back then like nothing's changed in the last hundred years they said you're supposed to be dead of scurvy. I'm reading that book and he says that was one of the main things they ate they also didn't eat any salt

<timemark seconds="5841" />

now they were even like whale blubber and seal fat Caribou yeah but he said they gave a lot of really lean cuts to the dogs today ate a lot of the fatty or cuz they had the brain date fat behind he goes into some serious UTI late. Behind the eyes they boiled a lot a boiled phones for the marrow so they got fat out of that and then for part of the year they also had steal the Flop on. I haven't had that the first deer I've shot we ate the fat behind eyes taste it's like I know

<timemark seconds="5887" />

snow

<timemark seconds="5888" />

it's not the best but it's it's definitely it was just weird like like dough that's where there's another person who was just eating meeting for some reason people forgotten about him so maybe the best to eat would be those really fat Japanese cows was Kobe beef cows or why cuz those are fat as fuck you look at those marbled cat sound like when it's terrible. Yeah what I've been doing recently which is a lot cheaper is getting ground beef which is lean and adding Tallow and just trying it just spoonfuls of Tallow in there you just eat it just put in a bowl and eat it there you getting bored with this at all

<timemark seconds="5947" />

because the diarrhea was one of the reason it sucks but I was also like a missing salad I was having and I only want some greens down so it was pretty easy transition kind of but is there a family on the side as well as your boss yeah he's on his way and now it does he have any issues health issues he was depressed

<timemark seconds="5969" />

pretty severe depression what was causing his depression had the same issues as me and I know how that sounds but my dad was like this seems to be genetic how can you have it too but there's not genetic

<timemark seconds="5986" />

that's interesting the action but he was like this is some around them has something they start to develop the same symptoms of pale you can see it oh one thing I wanted to address when I was on here and Sean Baker's episode he said something about eating apples to give him low back pain in your like apples give you low back pain people in the comments were freaking out that's a symptom that happens to me too and it's not drops I get lower back pain and so does Dad and it's funny to freak out about to get it but that's very commonly associated with depression and it is triggered by food with me too

<timemark seconds="6046" />

what information causing foods like pasta and sugar yeah I want a physical therapist once when I was having had a bulging disc in my neck and she suggested that I cut out gluten I thought you was a crazy person talking about cut out gluten she was I know it sounds crazy but a lot of these things cause issues and they they cause inflammation that was like the first steps to the first epic gluten also the first steps that took to understand that foods cause inflammation I've never thought about it all I said hello and try to fix it how do I fix my neck when she was saying this that would the reduction of inflammation causing Foods would lead to healing in certain issues I was very incredulous what sounds like some fucking wacky chiropractor bullshit but there's something to it and you know there's there's something to first of all the weight reduction soon as you cut out all these

<timemark seconds="6106" />

sugary Foods in your body just carrying my stuff around you carrying let's meet mean M people don't realize how much it is to work out do you like a bodyweight workout now do that same body weight workout with a 40-pound vest on it's way harder fucking way harder than most people out there wandering around Italy's 40 pounds over some this backpack that I put metal plates on its it's by this company called Outdoorsman's and it's like a basic of the frame of a hiking backpack you snap it in and it puts an Olympic plate on the back and locks in place and wow so they really centers in your back as opposed to like a lot of people do weighted hikes but they put sandbags in there in a kind of shifts and moves around but this is like really centers in L'Occitane place but if I do 45 pounds and I go hiking around like she kicks my ass it's hard going up the hills of 45 lb

<timemark seconds="6164" />

think about what most people just go through life with a lot of people go to your dad was 50 50 pounds overweight more think of that it's a lot of weight that where is your ass out and then that's one of the reasons why people say they don't have the energy to exercise carrying around all this way there actress it like really heavy overweight person people and I look at their legs probably can kick through a wall someone could teach him how to kick like to think about how much weight you're carrying around the time their needs are probably super strong like all the tissue around their legs is constantly carrying his heavy load up stairs if you could lose weight you probably have amazing legs look a diet

<timemark seconds="6207" />

how do you go though from this to doing consulting and is it is it a big leap to like me and you try to figure your own life out to take to help other people online you don't have a degree in nutrition God no will but what am I going to get a degree in nutrition for they still teach people eat grain

<timemark seconds="6228" />

Joe that was never never in the books today like if you went to a university today like a really good school do you think they would still be saying the grains are good good idea to eat I do I don't know that so I could be wrong but yeah I would say it's still pretty food pyramid e

<timemark seconds="6247" />

well I don't know if they go the old way with the when you're reading dr. Seuss books mom is all rice and wheat I think it's a good mix of make sure you get your fruits and vegetables what is the oil drain for most people in some areas thousand years in some areas 2000 years and if you're Native American like 200 years there have been green for very long why do people suddenly think they can digest that just because we're people

<timemark seconds="6282" />

so you don't believe rice rice a grain rice gluten grains are obviously a lot harder on people and even I tolerated kind of for a while but yeah I don't I think grains feed a lot of people so that's why the agricultural era came around now we can feed tons of people will just make people thrive I don't think it's good for their God I don't think that's surprising considering we haven't been eating it long enough to evolve with it you have with will you call like a paleo diet or healthy diet show with vegetables and do you think there's an issue eating vegetables

<timemark seconds="6326" />

I think it really depends on the person I think that this beef salt and water diet is a really good Elimination Diet and if you're seriously suffering and you have like nothing to lose you can give it a go suffer through the transition. And then try and once you feel okay try and reintroduce foods and see where you stand what about vitamin supplementation though and like why wouldn't you tell people what mood why would you recommend multi vitamins or a multivitamin pack covers all your Basics if you want if you're really concerned about vitamins get vitamin infusions I react to multivitamins to the fillers there aren't any pure vitamins you can take unless you take them in powder form so you can get like Vitamin C powder potassium powder but it's hard to get the other vitamins in powder form and I react to everything so yeah

<timemark seconds="6377" />

I probably wouldn't react if your gelatin capsules but like seller microcrystalline cellulose is in a lot of them

<timemark seconds="6387" />

well a lot of them is like bind it together you know if it's like a tablet that is like powdery stuff that isn't the actual vitamin I don't know I haven't liked by because it's this month long reaction I pretty much just said get rid of all the variables you can get rid of and start from scratch and then you can see if if things are bothering you if you're worried about vitamins get infusion right but what I was saying is that you were talking about these binders today exist in capsules as well unless they're in powdered form or right there by infusion I couldn't find a multivitamin I could take a lot of vitamin K is derived from soy so I'll react to that amount of soy in the infusions are talking about Ivy and I did those though I did that during my pregnancy because just in case I don't react to that at all it's fine

<timemark seconds="6445" />

I didn't find I didn't see a benefit it did make me feel any better but how do you react to fish oil

<timemark seconds="6453" />

not well but it was hard to tell because I was reacting to other things at the same time so I don't I don't eat chicken anymore and I don't eat fish anymore because it doesn't make me feel as good as beef

<timemark seconds="6466" />

but it doesn't give you a bad reaction not like soy or grains but now

<timemark seconds="6481" />

no dessert but the thing is the Cravings go away after you transition over so I don't even care three times usually if I'm doing more I eat more otherwise I'm eating about 2 and 1/2 pounds a day if they're fire then I'll eat less and like drink like sparkling water which I love. Excites me

<timemark seconds="6513" />

now what do you think about people that say that this idea might work in the short term in the short term but in the long term it's not sustainable

<timemark seconds="6525" />

I don't even know what kind of response to have to that like

<timemark seconds="6529" />

what I don't do I Need for Speed World vegan diet since they start off they feel great. Like oh my God this is the diet for me this amazing in overtime their body starts reacting to the lack of nutrients lack of cholesterol lack of saturated fat and it doesn't doesn't different bodies mean obviously some people have no problem with it but some people have like legitly Chris Kresser perfect example he started out with a macrobiotic vegan diet have real serious reaction to it over time sorry about doing well and then overtime started to break his body down and then I forgot but when I start reintroducing meat back into his dad had a massive ramp up you know it's so worried about it like I was so sick before then and now I'm better what I was concerned I was going to die in the long run before but now I'm feeling good I don't

<timemark seconds="6589" />

see why I would just randomly get sick suddenly I'm getting my vitamins tested because people are curious but I don't have any symptoms besides in contact with this woman to spend not personally but there are in the states and so Sean Baker is probably the loudest proponent of one of the most vocal in most public and he's been doing and I believe two years

<timemark seconds="6617" />

my friend Chris Bell's been doing it for a while as well I think he's less than a year but he eats apples he loves apples really just his stats seriously it's cuz I limited like I went down on all my sugar and then I was eating hordes of apples and that was my sugar and that was hard to kick her give you low back pain other things but yeah comes along with it depression and arthritis

<timemark seconds="6651" />

the whole thing is a really interesting conversation because there's so much going on with it it's and it's not an objective conversation it for the most part like many people that get into this they get into this very charged it's charged almost politically it's charged ideologically it's charged with her it's you know ethically and morally and it's it's charged where people are very skeptical also they have this diet that they believe in that they been following it so anything that's contractor that they were jacked up and go we'll have you left your diet it's like what what stop eating sugar and all my problems will go away I've been on the other end of the spectrum and I used to get mad when people said but it was like condescending right if you'd like tried to have you tried exercising have you looked at your diet was like I'm dying

<timemark seconds="6711" />

and I thought this wasn't even a conversation 10 years ago weird like the cutting the sugar out and cutting the carbs out this is so new style now and this like me. It's really nail popular or likes you or something people heard of

<timemark seconds="6741" />

it's really interesting it's in when I see your dad and how healthy he is and how he looks so good it looks thinner like it's like it's like he's all sucked into looks like yeah healthy he looks like a different person in the person I knew and I look like a different person in the person I knew my face looks different in a good way there's something definitely definitely healthy about getting a lot of fat and this is something that I think we've ignored with our obsession with carbs in one of the things that is a giant benefits for people that cut the carbs out is the way you feel about food like you don't get these massive crave my God yeah yeah

<timemark seconds="6788" />

I was starving all the time I just felt like I was starving and I to eat and then I would feel so full and it turns out it was bloating right but I know that I just feel so full that I would literally have to ask people to take my plate away or I would keep eating cuz I was starving but stuffed and I was just my state and all the time no matter how full I am if you put a plate of french fries with salt on them front of me I will go after those pitches I can't help myself this so good with some ketchup like fat steak fries that are like kind of well done with some salt on them and catch up this is something about that trick that biological trick that does God damn potatoes play on you

<timemark seconds="6834" />

but yeah it's kind of addictive but I know and it turns out that even like the amount of solid I was eating lettuce it was still kind of addictive cuz I have like a lot of Cravings lettuce Cravings are so when you just only me your body takes them through process of glucose Genesis converted to glucose right and I'm always in my glucose is normal

<timemark seconds="6869" />

that's what's weird the fact that you're always in ketosis because most people think that if you eat too much protein if you like convert what I'm eating to the fat ratio 80% of my calories are I'm getting from fat are you doing this on a nap or something mostly typing in the cuts and then I can kind of ADD and how much Tallow I'm adding to lean ground beef and how much tile do you how do you do about a tablespoon or tablespoon scoop it in but if I if I was measuring it I'd like four or five heat the Tallow up first and then cook the beef into it or do you

<timemark seconds="6911" />

it's way more satisfying though cuz eating lean ground beef just isn't great it's dry it's so you know but when I mix it with butter and stuff like that it's time just makes us great

<timemark seconds="6931" />

my voicemail so when you're you're looking at the future and you know you're saying okay this is going well this is you know how much better than anything I've ever done before I feel so much better you feel like this is where you going to eat the rest your life

<timemark seconds="6954" />

oh no I'm not arguing against it I'm just wondering that's what they ate they were healthy enough teeth fell out like they weren't sick like we're sick you stop and think about it meme didn't we have all that way too I don't know we can't say we changed kind of I mean but different people that grew up in different areas of the world I think they have is not been proven that there's different nutritional requirements that different people have if your grew up in different areas

<timemark seconds="7007" />

what is a diet that people lose there's like some some diet that they they try to

<timemark seconds="7016" />

was based on blood work the blood type diet that the idea is that different people that have different blood types there they're coming from different parts of the world yeah I don't know I haven't really looked well man so my diet the basil days of Georgetown to go I know dad told me he said she's giving me a flare-up and my response was like well that's not possible like all I'm eating is mate and I still have the same response and then I told you I don't eat chicken when I switched over

<timemark seconds="7053" />

chicken started to make me not feel good when I was eating it. I've just given up on birds ruminant animals seem fine I tried buys envizen was fine what do what do you call it bison

<timemark seconds="7068" />

is that a Canadian I'm just going to go with us and Canadian things. I hope it's a Canadian that Suburban is red meat Fuddruckers

<timemark seconds="7087" />

finger ostrich Burger the fucking good and Ever by the sky Birds I haven't had that that's a sandhill crane sandhill crane is a really dark red that's what they call him they hunt them and they cook it and it's a really delicious lean but like soft juicy tender red meat in a photo of it yeah what wild Canada goose

<timemark seconds="7119" />

where I don't think we're allowed to eat that in Canada some some you not allowed to eat some migrating geese right but sandhill crane I bet you could eat wow I wonder if somebody wanted those in Texas and they said they were fantastic said some of the best meals I've ever eaten alive one of ET that I wouldn't want you to eat it then get hives and blame me for everything all over again yeah and I mean it could be worse like I could be surviving off of eggplant could be worse I thought if there's one thing I have to eat forever I hope it's take because I'm not going to get bored of steak and like I said the first month was kind of rough but then the Cravings go away and now it's like every meal in like

hate from vegan people

<timemark seconds="7182" />

not really I don't think I'm as inflammatory as some people cuz I can understand I mean if you're easily ideologies ideologically possessed that's different but if you go on the vegan diet you cut out processed food you get rid of Jerry Jerry was a huge trigger for me and you feel better then I can understand why you'd be going around saying the vegan diet is the way to eat dragon can I can understand where those people are coming from if you're idiot logically possessed and you're saying well it's the environment all the stuff I don't really care so no I don't get like a couple of emails about me spreading lies like I just I don't I don't really don't care

<timemark seconds="7231" />

that is the issue with the the the vegan diet except that it carries with it a moral High Ground at their health and going to that because it's they're trying to figure something out that's a different but that will moral thing like just let it go listen I think this is very interesting stuff you know I don't have your health issues and I think very few people do but obviously for you it's it's made some massive impacting and for your father as well means really

<timemark seconds="7269" />

it's very very interesting and like I said my friend lives in San Diego no problems I mean he's loving it I know several other people that have jumped on board as well too and they're they're seeing big benefits from it mean it's almost enough to make me want to try it but you should try the promise of wild game meat bad and do it you can order towel here it's on it like I haven't I've talked to people like programmers in Silicon Valley who Skype me they're healthy and they just want to be more productive and the cognitive benefits takes like 6 weeks and it's worth just seeing what it's like and it's worse for you I think

<timemark seconds="7320" />

people would see benefits if they tried it even healthy people does benefits of coming from

<timemark seconds="7327" />

I don't know I don't know if microbiome switch or if there's less you're just ingesting less plant stalks and or if they have like naturally occurring toxins depending on the plant to get bugs things to stop eating them that's just their defense mechanism so like oxalates that's a big one lectins like all those types of things are inflammatory and it's just like we've just found the plants that we can't all are like as humans we found the plans we can tolerate the easiest and don't kill us and we eat those and we bred them so that they're easier to eat but still may be removing those from the diet seems to help people but it seems like giving it a six-week try

<timemark seconds="7372" />

I don't see a downside like I've only I've haven't seen anybody switch back and I've been talking to a lot of people on Skype over like periods of months and I haven't seen anyone switch back including the healthy people I'm curious this conversation's evolving that's for sure and you know it's evolving with many many people all across the country and you know when you take out the audiological or the moral High Ground argument that the vegetarians have it's it's it's interesting to me at the very least it's interesting yeah something going on so if people want to check out your blog what would that be what is it's Michaela petersons.com spell the Ila Peterson. Com calm and it's another name for it is in turn down eat that don't eat that if you go to dell.com
