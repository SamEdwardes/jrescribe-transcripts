He has worked for over a decade in simulation and design of space missions for NASA, develops biochemical models for the origin of life at UC Santa Cruz and collects vintage computers and their history in his DigiBarn computer museum. He has a practice exploring beyond the edges of consciousness to bring back stuff that is meaningful for humanity and the Gaian prerogative.  http://www.damer.com http://levityzone.org/"
