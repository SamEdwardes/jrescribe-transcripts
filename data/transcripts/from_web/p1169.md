<timemark seconds="354" />

My guest today is one of the most requested guests of all time with good reason. He's one of the most important and it's just unusual figures in human history I think the guy's a fucking wizard give it up for Elon Musk.

<timemark seconds="372" />

The Joe Rogan Experience

<timemark seconds="375" />

Joe Rogan

<timemark seconds="377" />

all day

<timemark seconds="379" />

thank you thanks doing this man really appreciate it very good to meet you in the middle of doing all the things you do create cars Rockets all the stuff you're doing constantly innovating decide to make flamethrower or have time for that

<timemark seconds="403" />

well if they might win a lot of time it's the flamethrower thing and it's sort of a the boring company started out as a joke and we decide to make it real and and think a tunnel through LA and then if you want other people ask us to dig tunnels so we said yes in a few cases section that only has one piece of merchandise at a time

<timemark seconds="441" />

risotto for the cap and there's only one thing on that it was just boring company.com cap hat that's it we sold the hats limited limited edition I just had the boring company

<timemark seconds="456" />

and then

<timemark seconds="457" />

under kind of Spaceballs the movie and in Spaceballs

<timemark seconds="463" />

yogurt goes through the merchandise inspection and they have a flamethrower in the merchandising section of Spaceballs

<timemark seconds="474" />

like the kids love that one best line

<timemark seconds="483" />

so we

<timemark seconds="484" />

does anybody tell you know for yourself but selling a flamethrower the liabilities all the people you're selling this device hinged people going to be buying a flamethrower in the first place to really want to connect ourselves all these potential arsonists

<timemark seconds="504" />

that's terrible idea to buy one I said don't buy this plane to her don't buy it don't buy it that's what I said still people bought it but if I can do to stop them build it I will come I said don't buy it it's dangerous it's wrong but still do it but it's like it's going to stop them how many do you make 20000

<timemark seconds="535" />

and they're all gone I think 4 days they sold out in four days are you going to do another run no I said what did 23000

<timemark seconds="551" />

2000 hats

<timemark seconds="553" />

I'm at and endom

<timemark seconds="557" />

that was a million dollars okay well will sell something for 10 million and that was $20,000 at $500 each

<timemark seconds="569" />

they went fast

<timemark seconds="571" />

how do you have the type of how do you have the time to do that though I mean I understand it's not a big deal in terms of all the other things you do but how do you have time to do anything I just I don't understand your time management skills

<timemark seconds="583" />

I mean it didn't spend much time on this flamethrower I'm going to be totally Frank it's actually just a roofing torch with an air rifle cover

<timemark seconds="593" />

it's not a real flamethrower which is why it says not a flamethrower that's why we were very clear this is not actually a plant or an end and it was already told that various countries would would ban shipping of it but they would not they would ban flamethrowers so we write to solve the problem for the Customs agencies week labeled it not a flamethrower

<timemark seconds="616" />

The Works effective I don't know I think so yeah so far yes but you do what you do so many different things like how do you do all that other shit how do you how do you how does one decide to fix LA traffic by drilling holes in the ground and who do you even approach with that like when you have this idea who do you talk to about that but I don't think it's going to be successful. You know I know it's like it's going to be successful but so far

<timemark seconds="647" />

I've lived in La for

<timemark seconds="650" />

16 years and the traffic is always been terrible and so I don't see any other ideas for improving the traffic so in desperation we're going to take a tunnel and maybe that'll be successful and maybe it won't

<timemark seconds="671" />

I'm I'm listening I'm not trying to convince you it's going to work and are the people that you were starting this though this is actually a project you're starting to implement about a mile what it what is the ultimate plan to have these in major city is an anywhere this mask congestion and just tried out in La first yeah it's it's it's in LA because I mostly live in LA that's the reason is a terrible place to dig tunnels this is one of the worst places to eat, because the most because of the paperwork I think it's like what about seismic it's like actually both tunnels are very safe and earthquakes earthquakes up

<timemark seconds="721" />

what is 1 * Century of surface phenomenon it's like like waves on the ocean so if there's a storm you want to be on the in a submarine submarine house constructed constructed out of these interlocking segments kind of like a snake Slither like a snake exoskeleton with double seals and so even when the ground moves the it's able to the tunnel actually was able to shift along with the ground like like an underground snake and it doesn't crack or break or at work and it's extremely unlikely that both seals would be broken and it's it's it's a capable of taking 5 atmospheres of pressure

<timemark seconds="769" />

it's waterproof methane proof will gas proof of any kind

<timemark seconds="774" />

and meets all California seismic requirements

<timemark seconds="778" />

so when you have this idea who you bring us to

<timemark seconds="782" />

I'm sure it mean when you have to bring it to someone that let you do it yeah so

<timemark seconds="793" />

they work they work some Engineers from SpaceX who thought it would be cool to do this and the Guy Rents It Like day two days is Steve Davis long time SpaceX engineer is great so stupid like

<timemark seconds="814" />

I'd like to help make this happen was a cool so we started off with

<timemark seconds="820" />

digging a hole in the ground it's got like a permit for a pit a pit and a big pit

<timemark seconds="835" />

yeah it was put in our parking lot and but do you have to give them some server blueprint for your ultimate idea and do they have to approve it like how does that work that way to start off with a pit okay and let you know

<timemark seconds="852" />

care about the existential nature of a pic you just say like I want a pit and the only ground for the pit and we dug the pit and

<timemark seconds="865" />

we're not going to 3 Days To 3 days 14 hours from like that cuz I was like a Student Competition we have for you to make the fastest pot in the hyperloop and this was get the finals going to be on Sunday afternoon and so they're coming by on Sunday afternoons like you know and then like show Eric and I saw we was like Friday morning

<timemark seconds="898" />

yes I was about to go over 40 out of 40 hours later we took the pit there's like when 24/7 or 24

<timemark seconds="911" />

and then we like Ike the pit the pit

<timemark seconds="918" />

but hey it's a hole in the ground is better than no hole in the ground and what do you tell me what this mean you just said this is good idea yes we're going to help funnel traffic better and they're going and they just go okay

<timemark seconds="932" />

that we weave joke around about this in the podcast for the like what are the person can go to the people that run the city and go dig some holes in the ground put some titles in there and they got it on the ground but it's not all the time but my question is like I know how much time you must be spending on your Tesla Factory I know how much time you must be spending on SpaceX you still have time to dig holes out of the ground in LA and come up with these ideas and then Implement I'm sure you did

<timemark seconds="965" />

yeah I just don't know how you manage your time I don't understand it doesn't seem it doesn't even seem humanly possible

<timemark seconds="973" />

you know what I do best and feels like don't you totally understand what I do with my time

<timemark seconds="979" />

they think like I'm a business guy or something like that if my Wikipedia page says business magnate would you call yourself a business magnet Wikipedia page 2 Magnus build the right now probably already changed engineering and Manufacturing in that kind of thing looks like 80% or more of my time ideas and then implementation of those ideas that's like hardcore engineering designing things going to

<timemark seconds="1018" />

structural mechanical electrical software user interface

<timemark seconds="1026" />

engineering aerospace engineering but you must understand it's not a whole lot of human beings like you you know that right

<timemark seconds="1033" />

cheer in Odyssey Champs like me we're all Champs some of us have all this time and all this energy and all these ideas and then people just let him do these things

<timemark seconds="1053" />

cuz I'm an alien that's what I've speculated on record saying this in the past I wonder if there was one was like maybe an intelligent being that we created in AI creature that's a superior to people maybe just hang around with us for a little while like you've been doing and then 6 months shit and that's the way

<timemark seconds="1076" />

I might have some mutation or something like that you might do you think you do probably wonder like you around normal people you like

<timemark seconds="1085" />

take what's up with these boring. Motherfuckers ever not bad for a human

<timemark seconds="1091" />

but I think

<timemark seconds="1094" />

I will not be able to hold a candle to AI you scared the shit out of me when you talk about is between you and Sam Harris consider until at a podcast with Sam wants my pants talking about a I I I realize I call will this is a genie that wants out of the bottle you never getting it back in that's true

<timemark seconds="1116" />

there was a video that you tweeted about one of those Boston Dynamic robots and they're like in the future it'll be moving so fast you can't see without a strobe light you probably do that right now

<timemark seconds="1131" />

and no one's really paying attention too much of them people like you or people that are really obsessed with technology all these things are happening and he's robots her could you see the one where Peter put out statement you shouldn't kick robots probably not wise for Retribution their memories very good I bet it's really good it's really good I bet it is getting better every day really are you honestly legitimately concerned about this is like a I one of your main worries in regards to the Future

<timemark seconds="1168" />

yes it's less of a worry than it used to be mostly to two

<timemark seconds="1175" />

taking more of a fatalistic attitude

<timemark seconds="1179" />

so you used to have more hope

<timemark seconds="1182" />

and you gave up some of it and now you don't worry as much about a i you like this is just what it is

<timemark seconds="1191" />

it pretty much a bad

<timemark seconds="1199" />

it's just it's definitely going to be outside of human control not necessarily bad right. It's not necessarily bad it's just

<timemark seconds="1208" />

it's just outside of human control the thing that's going to be tricky here is that it's going to be very tempting to use AI as a weapon

<timemark seconds="1218" />

very tempting in fact will be used as weapon

<timemark seconds="1224" />

so the the aren't leave the on-ramp to sirius AI

<timemark seconds="1231" />

the danger is going to be more humans using it against each other I think most likely

<timemark seconds="1238" />

that'll be the danger how far do you think we are from something that can make its own mind up whether or not something is ethically and morally correct or they're not it wants to do something over there wants to improve itself and whether or not he wants to protect itself from people or from other AI how far away we something from something is really truly sentient

<timemark seconds="1264" />

well I mean you cannot argue about any group of people like it like a a company is essentially a cybernetic Collective of people and that's what a company is

<timemark seconds="1281" />

and then there are different

<timemark seconds="1285" />

list of the levels of complexity in the way these companies are formed

<timemark seconds="1291" />

and then there are surf

<timemark seconds="1293" />

is this like a collective a I in

<timemark seconds="1297" />

and the Google search Google search in about

<timemark seconds="1301" />

we're we're also plugged in as the notes on the network like leaves on a big tree

<timemark seconds="1310" />

Rudolph bra fitting this network that questions and answers

<timemark seconds="1316" />

Rock electrically programming Vai

<timemark seconds="1320" />

and look at Google Plus the old humans that connect to it or one giant seven a collective this is also true of Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and only social networks

<timemark seconds="1335" />

the Giants have no to collectors

<timemark seconds="1339" />

humans Electronics all interfacing and constantly now constantly connected

<timemark seconds="1345" />

constantly

<timemark seconds="1347" />

1 things that I've been thinking about a lot over the last few years is that one of the things that drives a lot of people crazy as how how many people are obsessed with materialism and getting the latest greatest thing and I wonder how much of that is a lot of it is most certainly fueling technology and Innovation it almost seems like it's built into us like what we like and what we want that were fueling this thing that's constantly around us all the time and it doesn't seem possible that people going to pump the brakes it doesn't seem possible at this stage we were consoling expected newest cell phone latest Tesla update the newest MacBook Pro everything has to be newer and better

<timemark seconds="1387" />

and that's going to lead to some incredible point

<timemark seconds="1394" />

it seems like it's built into US almost seems like it's an instinct that we were working towards that they would like it our job just like the ants build the anthill our job is just coming out of the fuel this

<timemark seconds="1410" />

yes

<timemark seconds="1413" />

let me just find some some years ago but it feels like we are the biological Bootloader for a I effectively we all building it

<timemark seconds="1423" />

and then rebuilding progressively greater in intelligence

<timemark seconds="1429" />

and the percentage of intelligence that is not human is increasing and eventually we will represent a very small percentage of intelligence

<timemark seconds="1442" />

but the AI is informed by the human limbic system

<timemark seconds="1450" />

and it is in large part out your drift Lodge

<timemark seconds="1456" />

how so we mention all those things the set of Primal drives that's all whole thing except

<timemark seconds="1466" />

we like

<timemark seconds="1468" />

I hate

<timemark seconds="1469" />

and fear

<timemark seconds="1472" />

they're all they're on the internet but their projection of Olympic system

<timemark seconds="1482" />

it don't make sense the thinking of it as a thing of Corporations and just thinking of the human beings communicating online to his social media Network to some sort of an organism that too

<timemark seconds="1497" />

it's a cyborg to get into combination to combination of electronics in biology

<timemark seconds="1505" />

this is it seems like it's the success of these

<timemark seconds="1509" />

online systems is there is a face of a function of

<timemark seconds="1515" />

of how much limbic resonance they're able to achieve with people

<timemark seconds="1522" />

the more limbic resonance the more engagement

<timemark seconds="1527" />

where is like one of the reasons why I probably Instagram is more enticing than Twitter limbic resonance more images more video system or yes he worried about war Wonder in fact about what the next step is

<timemark seconds="1545" />

a lot of people didn't see Twitter coming that no communicate with 140 characters or 280 now would be a thing that people would be interested in

<timemark seconds="1555" />

Excel is going to become more connected to us right

<timemark seconds="1561" />

yes things are getting more connected there at this point constrained by mad with our input output is slow but typically output Africa Taurus with thumbs and we just have a photo 1010 thing is now if thumbs

<timemark seconds="1578" />

images artist also are there a way of communicating at high-bandwidth take pictures and you send pictures people what sends that's that communicates fall more information than you can communicate so what happened with you or you decided or you took on a more fit elastic attitude like what was there any specific thing or was it just the inevitability of our future

<timemark seconds="1611" />

I tried to convince people to slow down slow down AI

<timemark seconds="1615" />

to regulate AI

<timemark seconds="1619" />

this was futile

<timemark seconds="1621" />

I tried for years

<timemark seconds="1623" />

the see nobody was seen in a movie with a robot give me out nobody listened it seems like an issue that's brought up more often over the last few years that it was maybe 5-10 years ago it seems like science fiction

<timemark seconds="1643" />

maybe they will

<timemark seconds="1644" />

so far they haven't

<timemark seconds="1648" />

letting people don't like the only the way that's regulations work is very slow indeed

<timemark seconds="1656" />

so

<timemark seconds="1658" />

usually I'll be something so new technology

<timemark seconds="1663" />

will cause damage or death

<timemark seconds="1667" />

there will be an outcry

<timemark seconds="1669" />

they will be investigation years will pass there will be some sort of insight committee they will be rulemaking then they will be over so I might actually regulations this whole takes many years this is the normal course of things if you look at saved Automotive regulations how long did it take for seatbelts to be to reap implemented to be required

<timemark seconds="1695" />

did the water industry Ford seat belts I think for more than a decade

<timemark seconds="1699" />

success report any regulations on seatbelt even though

<timemark seconds="1704" />

the numbers are extremely obvious if you had a seat belts on you would be far less likely to die I will be seriously injured unequivocal

<timemark seconds="1716" />

and Dentistry Fortis what years successfully

<timemark seconds="1722" />

miss lady how many many people died

<timemark seconds="1727" />

Regulators insisted on the belts

<timemark seconds="1731" />

this is like this time frame is not relevant to AI you can't take 10 years from the point which is dangerous so late

<timemark seconds="1743" />

you feel like this is decades away or years away

<timemark seconds="1750" />

from being too late if you have this fatalistic attitude and feel like it's going we're in a almost like a doomsday countdown it's out of control countdown I control

<timemark seconds="1769" />

and that's that plug everything about it is it to Sinclair it's hard to predict like a black hole what what happens past the Event Horizon happen and it will be able to improve itself yes

<timemark seconds="1786" />

that's where get spooky write the idea that it can do thousands of years of innovation we're very very quickly

<timemark seconds="1795" />

and then we'll be just ridiculous ridiculous we will be like this ridiculous biological shiting pissing thing trying to stop the gods no stop we like we like living with a finite lifespan and and watching in Norman Rockwell paintings

<timemark seconds="1811" />

it could be terrible and it could be great it's not clear but one thing is for sure we will not control it you think that it's likely that we will merge somehow or another with this sort of technology and it'll augment what we are now or do you think it will replace us

<timemark seconds="1836" />

well that's the snart the emerge scenario with AI is the one that seems

<timemark seconds="1843" />

but probably the best lacrosse yes if you can't beat it join it that's yeah

<timemark seconds="1857" />

so

<timemark seconds="1859" />

I'm a long-time existential standpoint that's like the purpose of New Orleans is to create a high bandwidth interface to the brain so that we can be somebody with a i

<timemark seconds="1875" />

cuz we have a bandwidth problem these can't communicate through your fingers is too slow where is normal Link at right now

<timemark seconds="1885" />

I think we'll have something interesting to announce in a few months

<timemark seconds="1889" />

that's at least an order of magnitude Valentine thing else

<timemark seconds="1892" />

pipe any better than probably anyone thinks is possible how much can talk about that right now I don't jump the gun on that but what's like the ultimate what's what's the idea behind like what are you trying to accomplish with it what would you like best case scenario

<timemark seconds="1909" />

best case scenario we

<timemark seconds="1912" />

if I truly merge with AI where we met eyes so does a touch recog nition layer

<timemark seconds="1921" />

however got the limbic system me a primitive brain essentially got the cortex to your car and it's about a relationship with your cortex and Lenox is tomorrow in Temecula show me people like their cortex and they like the limbic system I have met anyone who wants to delete their limbic system or delete their cortex already seems like both

<timemark seconds="1945" />

and the cortex is mostly in service to the limbic system fuel may think that

<timemark seconds="1951" />

happy thinking part of themselves isn't charged but it's mostly their limbic system that's in charge and the cortex is trying to make the limbic system happy that's what most of that computer power is orange towards how can I make the living system happy

<timemark seconds="1971" />

if we do have a third layer which is the AI extension of yourself that is also symbiotic

<timemark seconds="1979" />

Amanda's enough bandwidth between the cortex and the AI extension of yourself

<timemark seconds="1986" />

such that the AI de facto separate

<timemark seconds="1990" />

then that could be a good outcome that could be quite a positive outcome for the future so instead of replacing us it will radically change our capabilities

<timemark seconds="2000" />

yes it will it will

<timemark seconds="2004" />

enable anyone who wants to have super human cognition

<timemark seconds="2012" />

anyone who wants this is not a matter of running power because you're running file would be vastly greater after you do it so it just like anyone who wants can just do it

<timemark seconds="2023" />

very necessary and and if that's the case then and let's save

<timemark seconds="2031" />

billions of people do it then the outcome for Humanity will be

<timemark seconds="2037" />

the sum of of human will

<timemark seconds="2043" />

but some of billions of people's desire for the future

<timemark seconds="2048" />

Black Betty lyrics of people with enhanced cognitive ability how much different than people today if you had to explain it to a person who didn't really not understand what you're saying how much different you talking about when you say radical and prove it what do you mean

<timemark seconds="2071" />

you mean the mind-reading redeeming to really appreciate the difference

<timemark seconds="2078" />

it's like how much smarter are you with a phone or computer than without its your vastly smarter actually

<timemark seconds="2086" />

you know you can answer any question to an Xterra can answer any question we watch instantly and calculation that your phone's memory is essentially perfect how you can remember fall asleep before your phone can remember videos

<timemark seconds="2102" />

pictures everything perfectly that's your phone is already an extension of you you're already a cyborg you don't even what must roll their eyes they are already a cyborg if the phone is an extension of yourself it's just that the the data rate rate at which communication between you and the cybernetic extension of yourself that is your phone and computer is slow it's very slow

<timemark seconds="2134" />

and that is like a tiny straw

<timemark seconds="2139" />

how about information flow between your biological self and your digital self

<timemark seconds="2147" />

and we need to make that tiny stroll like a giant River huge high-bandwidth in her face and face problem

<timemark seconds="2157" />

Gatorade phone

<timemark seconds="2159" />

solidary problem

<timemark seconds="2161" />

I think

<timemark seconds="2163" />

I think we hang on to

<timemark seconds="2166" />

human machine symbiosis through long-term

<timemark seconds="2170" />

and if you want me to decide that they want to retain their biological self or not

<timemark seconds="2176" />

I think I'll probably choose hurt and about it biological self versus some sort of Ray Kurzweil scenario where they download themselves into a computer it will be essentially snapshot it into the computer anytime if your biological cell size are just probably upload into a new unit

<timemark seconds="2193" />

destroy

<timemark seconds="2198" />

is it got ridiculous down the rabbit hole grab a soccer give me some of that this is too freaky see if I was by the way thank you

<timemark seconds="2215" />

the words came from who brought this to us Old Camp it was thanks again for going back to you when you decided to have this fatalistic Viewpoint so you weren't you tried to warn people you talked about this pretty extensively I read several interviews we talked about this and then you just sorta just said okay just is let's just end you in wait you're by communicating the potential for me for sure you're getting the warning out to some people

<timemark seconds="2249" />

yeah I mean I was really going on

<timemark seconds="2254" />

the warning quite quite a while

<timemark seconds="2258" />

morning everyone I could

<timemark seconds="2261" />

your mouth Obama in just for one reason like it just let me listen I'm at with congress met with I was at a meeting of all 50 Governors and talk about just say I danger and I hope that when I could

<timemark seconds="2293" />

I want to seem to realize where this was going

<timemark seconds="2297" />

is it that or do they just assume that someone smarter than them is already taken care of it

<timemark seconds="2302" />

cuz when when people hear about something like a guy but it's almost abstract it's almost it's almost like it's so it's so hard to wrap your head around it by the time already happens it'll be too late

<timemark seconds="2314" />

yeah

<timemark seconds="2318" />

don't quite understand that or didn't think it was near Tara Moore

<timemark seconds="2323" />

not sure what to do about it

<timemark seconds="2326" />

I feel like you don't obviously to do is to just establish

<timemark seconds="2330" />

at the committee committee to gain Insight dinner before before you oversight before you do make regulations least like to try to understand what's going on and you have a inside committee

<timemark seconds="2346" />

and that once they learn what's going on GIF speed then they can make maybe some rolls or propose some rolls

<timemark seconds="2354" />

and and that would be probably a safer way to go about things it seems I mean I know that it's probably something that the government supposed to handle but it seems like I wouldn't want to I don't want the government to handle this who do you want to I feel like you're the one who could ring the bell better cuz if Mike Pence are talk about a Emily shut up bitch come on man hasn't always talk about other companies we have agreements where you're not supposed to dump toxic waste into the ocean you're not supposed to do certain things that could be terribly

<timemark seconds="2397" />

damaging even though there be profitable maybe this is one of those things maybe you should realize that you can't hit the switch on something that's going to be able to think for itself and make up its own mind as to whether or not it wants to survive or not and whether or not he thinks you're a threat

<timemark seconds="2411" />

weather I think you're useless like why do I keep this dumb finite life-form alive why why keep this thing around it's just stupid it just keeps polluting everything shiting everywhere Coast lighting everything on fire and shooting each other want to keep this stupid thing a lot cuz sometimes it makes good music that I don't sometimes it makes great movies sometimes it makes beautiful art and sometimes it you know sometimes it's cool to hang out with Mike for us those are great reasons standing outside like this is definitely a flawed system is like if you went to the Jungle you watch his Champs engage in Warfare impeach of the Way Up remix the fucking real name in like a documentary I like damn he's Trump's are mean they're mean yeah they're cool they're calculated yeah yeah they sneak up on each other and

<timemark seconds="2471" />

rice chips did calculated cruelty

<timemark seconds="2476" />

but that mean kind of game over this is dark right but we know better because we've Advanced but if we hadn't we be like man I don't want to fucking live in the house I like the champ why is bro boys go this is it man chip life tell me what kind of life but we in a way to the a I might be like those chimps unlike these stupid Fox launch missiles out of drones and shooting each other underwater like we're crazy we got Torpedoes submarines and fucking airplane that dropped nuclear bombs in discriminately on cities are assholes

<timemark seconds="2515" />

yeah they might go why are they doing this it might like look it up politics look at what we do in terms of our food system what kind of food we forced on each other's throats and they look out for themselves

<timemark seconds="2532" />

how much do we think about chimps not much there a little it's like at War like roofs are chimps attack each other and we kill each other and they torture each other pretty bad they hunt monkeys

<timemark seconds="2551" />

they're like this is probably the most but you know I mean it was last night let me all the time podcast

<timemark seconds="2568" />

right now yeah, I saw that David Attenborough documentary on Channel 4 they were eating those colobus monkeys and ripping them apart this is why people are so crazy we came from that thing yeah exactly right now or seem to be way more even than us way more civilized that's okay Mom I'll bring your son's there good women

<timemark seconds="2613" />

haven't seen the bonobo movie Disturbing just at a zoo gay-straight whatever this is fog

<timemark seconds="2630" />

I haven't seen one of us at is Eli's probably like I don't think I'm being out of the PGA section I don't think they have them at many zooz we looked at before but I was just always jacking off and what's that they have in San Diego

<timemark seconds="2651" />

yeah I know how many other in a cage you know whether or not we are ultimate goal is to give birth to some new thing and that's why we're so obsessed with technology is not like this technology is really I mean it's certainly enhancing our lives in a certain way but it is ultimately isn't making people happier right now most technology would say No in fact you and I were talking about social media before this about just not having Instagram on your phone and not do you feel better yes I think one of the issues with social media has been pointed out by many people is that

<timemark seconds="2696" />

I think maybe particularly Instagram people look like they have a much better life then they really do posting pictures of when they're really happy there are modifying those pictures to better looking for not modifying pictures or at least selecting the pictures for the best lighting the best angle so people basically seen their way better looking than they really are and their way happier saving then they really are so if you look at everyone on Instagram you might think man they're always happy beautiful people and

<timemark seconds="2740" />

I'm not that good looking and I'm not happy so I'ma suck you know and that's going to

<timemark seconds="2746" />

I feel sad so when in fact those people you think are super happy actually not that happy somewhere or really depressed they're very sad

<timemark seconds="2758" />

so happy I seen people actually some of the saddest people in reality

<timemark seconds="2765" />

and then nobody looks good all the time doesn't matter who you are

<timemark seconds="2769" />

it's not even something you should want what do you want to look great all the time so it's quite sad person could you search people generally could think of those cells relative to two others it's it's a wheel constantly r e

<timemark seconds="2791" />

we baselining our expectations

<timemark seconds="2795" />

and you can see the say if you watch them sure like Naked and Afraid or interesting going to try living in the Woods by yourself for a while and you're like the one I suppose a she was quite great as what's lot of people want to come back to the station pretty fast on Naked and Afraid the real quote the comparison is the thief of joy

<timemark seconds="2817" />

yeah well happiness is reality minutes expectations that's great too but the comparison is the thief of Joy really holds true to peep is it in when you think about Instagram cuz would essentially Instagram is with a lot of people as you're giving them the opportunity to be their own PR agent and they always go towards the glamorous and when and if anybody does show that you know hashtag no filter know you're so brave lucky you don't make up

<timemark seconds="2851" />

damn you look good anyway you look great we doing oh my God you have makeup on I still look hot as fuck you know you're doing I know what you're doing to their there they're letting you know and then they feeding off that comment section who

<timemark seconds="2866" />

sitting there like look at a fresh stream of love like you getting right up to the sources it comes out of the earth and you suck and that's a lot of lot of a mole of water emojis my concern is not so much what Instagram is is that I didn't think the people had the need for this or the expectation for some sort of technology that allows them to constantly get love and adulation from strangers and comments and Industry ability to project this sort of distorted version of who you really are but I worry about where it goes like what's the next one what's the next one and where is it is it going to be augmented some sort of a weird augmented or virtual sort of Instagram type situation where you're not going to want to live in this real world you going to want to interface with this sort of world that you've created through your social media page some next-level thing

<timemark seconds="2918" />

yeah you're living the simulation simulation kind of freaks me out my kids fucking love it man they love it they love playing these weirdo games and end in walk around that headset on but part of me watching them do it goes wow I wonder if this is like the precursor to sort of like if you look at that that phone did Gordon Gekko had on the beach and you compare cell phone Galaxy Note 9 and I wonder when I see this HTC Vive my what is that thing going to be 10 years from now when we're making fun of what it is now what is it how I mean how ingrained and how how how connected an interconnected is this technology going to be in our life

<timemark seconds="2973" />

it will be

<timemark seconds="2976" />

at some point indistinguishable from reality will lose this will lose this like you and I just looking at each other through our eyes I see you and you see me I think I hope you think so I think

<timemark seconds="2988" />

this could be some simulation he could do you entertain that

<timemark seconds="2995" />

well the argument for the simulation I think is quite strong

<timemark seconds="3000" />

because if you assume any Improvement at all overtime any Improvement 1% .1% to 6:10 the time frame make it a thousand years a million years the universe is 13.8 billion years old

<timemark seconds="3015" />

what civilization if you counted your very generous civilization is maybe seven or eight thousand years old if you counted for the first writing

<timemark seconds="3026" />

there's nothing there's nothing

<timemark seconds="3030" />

so if you seen any rate of improvement at all

<timemark seconds="3035" />

then games will be indistinguishable from reality

<timemark seconds="3043" />

or civilization will end one of those two things will occur

<timemark seconds="3050" />

although we almost like we in a simulation or we're on our way to one right because we exist we could most certainly be on the road we could be on the road to that right doesn't mean it has to a pretty face reality it could be reality we could be here now on our way to the road or on our way to the destination where this can never happen again where we are completely ingrained in some sort of an artificial technology or some sort of a symbiotic relationship with the Internet or the next level of sharing information but right now we're not there yet that's possible to write it's possible that a simulation is one day going to be inevitable they were going to have something that's indistinguishable from regular reality but maybe we're not there yet that's also possible

<timemark seconds="3096" />

quite there yet that this is real I test out some shit like crap restaurants and they want Rob would ever want to see everyone at Sea metal people if they seem like people are like a longing towards some weird Log Cabin type measure algae ality clinging to track of the nails for the month yes I will go get a mason jar with the Weinstein door handle

<timemark seconds="3130" />

got Stark makes me lose faith in humanity handle they have those advantage of our our generous nature made with Weinstein I made with a handle they made it that way but that would be fine if there was a glued it on or something

<timemark seconds="3167" />

yeah that's like fake breasts that are designed to be hard like fake breasts from the 60s

<timemark seconds="3177" />

if you really long for the ones with ripples here we go it's almost what that is going to do a man does nothing to me know when you do stop terrible ideas from propagating

<timemark seconds="3192" />

yeah

<timemark seconds="3195" />

all right I don't I sound like things are too dark cuz I think like you kind of have to

<timemark seconds="3201" />

be optimistic about the future if there's no point in being pessimistic just two negative

<timemark seconds="3212" />

all right there is like you'd rather be optimistic optimistic than pessimistic and write at least we're on that side or pessimistic is going to be miserable

<timemark seconds="3228" />

yeah nobody wants me around you anyway if it's the end of the world is like a fucking told you bro the world ending

<timemark seconds="3237" />

it is what it is for all I mean enjoy the journey right if you really want to get morose mean it is what it is for all of us anyway we were all going to go unless some something changes and you know even if we just sort of existed as humans forever would be

<timemark seconds="3255" />

would still eventually that be like the heat death of the universe or no right to pass the sun the sun running out of juice eventually it's going to end it's just Assumption of when right is it really it's all about the journey or Transcendence from whatever we are now into something it doesn't worry about that

<timemark seconds="3279" />

the universe as we know it will dissipate into a fine mist

<timemark seconds="3286" />

Cold nothingness eventually and someone's going to bottle it put a fragrance to it sell it to French people in another dimension so so very long time how can you make it last longer

<timemark seconds="3301" />

are you a proponent of the multi universes Theory do you believe that there are many many universes and that even if this one Fades out that there's other ones that are starting fresh right now and there's an infinite number of them and they're just constantly and just never ending cycle of birth and death

<timemark seconds="3320" />

I think most likely this is just about probability there are many many simulations

<timemark seconds="3327" />

dissimulation is right you might as well call them reality or you can call the Multiverse the simulations you believe are created like someone has many they running on the substrate

<timemark seconds="3338" />

so that's a phrase probably boring boring how so

<timemark seconds="3345" />

or we create a simulation like a game or a movie it's a distillation of what's interesting about life

<timemark seconds="3353" />

you know it takes a year to shoot an action movie and then that's all the swell down in 2 or 3 hours

<timemark seconds="3362" />

so we tell you seen action movie being filmed for boring super boring

<timemark seconds="3368" />

takes those like lots of takes those living in a green screen looks pretty goofy doesn't look cool but when she had the CGI at and have a great editing its meaning

<timemark seconds="3382" />

so

<timemark seconds="3384" />

like most likely

<timemark seconds="3387" />

if we're simulation it's really boring outside the simulation

<timemark seconds="3394" />

cuz why would make some noise in this morning could make some Russian way more interesting to face reality

<timemark seconds="3398" />

get that is if this right now is a simulation yet and ultimately inevitably if as long as we don't die or get hit by a meteor we're going to create some sort of simulation to continue on the same technological password for on right now but we might not be there yet so might not be a simulation here

<timemark seconds="3419" />

but it most likely is you feel other places

<timemark seconds="3424" />

does notion of place or where is is

<timemark seconds="3434" />

that's a Vibe that's made by Valve and steam valve but made it a CC to the hardware but it's really about a thing makers of Half-Life yes

<timemark seconds="3458" />

when you're in that in that some in that

<timemark seconds="3461" />

virtual reality which is only going to get better

<timemark seconds="3466" />

where are you

<timemark seconds="3468" />

where are you really you aren't anywhere in the computer what defines where you are exactly right it's your perception is it breaks your perceptions or is it you know a scale that we have on your butt right here I measured you in the same weight as you were when you left

<timemark seconds="3484" />

are you mean while your experience why do you think there where you are right now you might not be I'll spark up join if you keep talking to your man just going to come in here we might have to lock the door right now you think you're in a studio in La you might be in a computer I think about this all the time

<timemark seconds="3500" />

yeah I mean it's unquestionable that one day that'll be the case as long as we keep going as long as nothing interrupts us and if we start from scratch and you know where single-celled organisms all over again and then millions and millions of years later we become the next thing that is us with creativity and ability to change its environment it's going to keep monkey in with things until he figures out a way to change reality to change I mean almost like punch a hole through what is this thing into what what it wants it to be and create new things and those new things will intersect with other people to do things and then we'll be this ultimate pathway of infinite ideas and expression all through technology

<timemark seconds="3548" />

yeah and then we're one that we're going to wander like

<timemark seconds="3553" />

why we are we doing

<timemark seconds="3556" />

let's find out I think we should take the actions the set of actions that are most likely to make the future better

<timemark seconds="3566" />

yes right and then reevaluate those actions to make sure they're there it's true I think there's a movement to that I mean in terms of like a social movement I think some of its misguided and some of its exaggerated in his lot a lot of people that are fighting for their side out there but it seems like the general trend of like social awareness seems to be much more height and now there's ever been in any other time in history because of our ability to express ourselves instantaneously to each other through Facebook or Twitter or what have you and that the trend is to abandon preconceived notions abandoned Prejudice abandoned discrimination and promote kindness and happiness as much as possible because it's nice when he gave it to me sorry with him and it just stayed here I have a real samurai sword fun to play with that I know you're into weapons

<timemark seconds="3626" />

1500 San Marcos

<timemark seconds="3639" />

yeah that's a legit samurai sword from an actual samurai from the 1500s if you pull out that blade that blade was made the old way where Master Craftsman folded that metal and hammered it down over and over again over a long period of time and home. Blade into what it is now what's crazy is that more than 500 years later that thing still pristine

<timemark seconds="3666" />

meet whoever took care of that pass it down to the next person who took care of it and took out to the podcast room it's pretty fucking crazy one day someone going to be looking at ass like that he's fucking back doors they pop up sideways like a Lamborghini

<timemark seconds="3690" />

you should see what the Tesla can do you didn't see you should. I'll show you after I love them do like ludicrous mode

<timemark seconds="3700" />

in terms of driving super fast and irresponsibly on public roads that we spend

<timemark seconds="3707" />

what can you do that

<timemark seconds="3710" />

but I need to know about Ivan the more likes can do this like ballet thing to the Trans-Siberian Orchestra it's pretty cool where dances if legitimate

<timemark seconds="3723" />

why would you program that into a car

<timemark seconds="3727" />

sounds like fun

<timemark seconds="3729" />

what about you that's what's weird like when you showed up here you were all smiles and you pull out a fucking blowtorch and not a blowtorch but I'm like looking lost her having fun like this is like this thing when you know what you program a car to do a ballet dance you're having fun though the earth center Rockets into space and and empowering people in Australia I kind of fucked you have time to make the car dance ballet

<timemark seconds="3764" />

well I mean in that case

<timemark seconds="3767" />

it was some engineers at Tesla that said you know what if we make this car dance and play music

<timemark seconds="3775" />

I like that sounds great

<timemark seconds="3777" />

let's try to get it done in time for Christmas we did about someone just losing their mind and making do that in the highway

<timemark seconds="3787" />

now it won't do that what if it's in bumper-to-bumper traffic no no won't do it actually have to drag people have the car lots of things that gets a hold of it everyone's don't know. It's everyone to eat if you search for the Steven search for how well they do now

<timemark seconds="3814" />

yes yes there's so many things about the little X in the model S in the model 3 that's

<timemark seconds="3822" />

people don't know about which probably already or something

<timemark seconds="3825" />

explain it

<timemark seconds="3827" />

cuz I have close friends of mine and I say do you know who can do this and I like nope

<timemark seconds="3834" />

do you want to do a video that how do you like the fact that some people don't know no I think it's probably not we should tell people yeah probably would help your product it's not like you don't sell enough you sell almost too many of them right

<timemark seconds="3851" />

I mean I think a Tesla

<timemark seconds="3856" />

it's the most fun thing you could possibly buy ever

<timemark seconds="3861" />

that's what it's meant to be well I'll goal is to make

<timemark seconds="3867" />

it's not exactly a car it's actually a thing to maximize enjoyment make us maximum fun

<timemark seconds="3877" />

electronic but big screen laptop ridiculous speed handling all that stuff

<timemark seconds="3885" />

yeah do you have a video games yeah well you won't be able to drive while you're playing the video game but we were just putting the Atari emulator ROM emulator in it and a bunch of other things. Max was too hard with the old trackball so this is does a touchscreen version of Missile Command so you have a chance do you have an old car don't you don't you have like an old Jaguar

<timemark seconds="3923" />

yeah yeah that's that's that that 61 series 1 E-Type Jaguar cars old cars

<timemark seconds="3933" />

I think I'm going to have all that

<timemark seconds="3939" />

old Ford Model T that a friend of mine giving is the Ford Model T all stock car that is of course I'm sorry, that's a good looking car license plate of mine it's a beautiful car.

<timemark seconds="3972" />

are there certain iconic shapes and that there's there's something about those cars to they're not as capable not nearly as capable as like a Tesla but there's something really satisfying about the mechanical aspect of like feeling the steering and they're grinding of the gears in the shifting

<timemark seconds="3992" />

something about those it's extremely satisfying even though they're not that confident like I have a 1993 Porsche 964 it's like a lightweight snot is the RS America's not very fast it's not like in comparison to a Tessler and said that but the thing about it is like it's mechanical feeler everything that it gives you this weird thrill like you're on this klinke ride and it's all this feedback and something to that

<timemark seconds="4027" />

yeah let me type is like basically no electronics

<timemark seconds="4032" />

so you like that but you also like Electronics yes it's like the end of electronics driving itself better every day it's like we're back to release the software that will enable you to just turn it on and it'll drive from Highway on-ramp to highway exit do Lane changes over take other cars to go from one interchange the next if you get on say the 405 and get off get off 300 miles later and go through several Highway interchanges and just take over take out the car is in hookah to the nav system

<timemark seconds="4072" />

and then you just meditating

<timemark seconds="4080" />

what did you think when you saw that video that dude falling asleep behind the wheel and I'm sure you've seen it the one in San Francisco is like right outside of San Jose to do doubt call like that in the car is in bumper-to-bumper traffic movie too long have you seen it right software if you don't touch the wheel it it will gradually slow down I put the emergency lights on and wake you up that's hilarious yeah that's hilarious you choose what voice wakes you up

<timemark seconds="4113" />

what's her more of a little punks like wake up fuck face danger something with a Southern accent hey why can't I get a sweetie, Siri when you program something like that in is this in response to a concern or is it your own do you look at it and go ahead and just be able to fall asleep

<timemark seconds="4159" />

to wake him up

<timemark seconds="4161" />

yeah yeah we it's like you know what book you know people are about to do something about that right but when you first released it you didn't consider it right you just like well no one's going to just sleep people fall asleep on the cars all the time crash crash crash car the good time for sure somebody out there was a guy was in an early Tesla

<timemark seconds="4201" />

driving down the highway and you fell asleep and you ran over cyclists and kill them

<timemark seconds="4207" />

as I can look man if we had autopilot when you run out of what we might have fallen asleep but only see when they run over that cyclist

<timemark seconds="4216" />

so how did you have permanent like did you just use cameras and programmed with the the system so that if it sees images it slows down and how much time do you give as the person who's in control of it allowed to program how fast it goes yes that you can program it to be more or less and more conservative look more aggressive driver and you can say what speed you wanted to watch what speed is okay

<timemark seconds="4251" />

well images for four lane changes is tricky because if you're in like la like a nice you're pretty aggressive rights Prius hard to change lanes when it's hard it's hard to be Namaste out here in LA or pushy yeah specially freeway speed up sometimes even in LA but sometimes they're not help that probably locked in together is hive mind

<timemark seconds="4293" />

I don't know how but we're not traffic that'll help a lot how many of those can you put in there so tell you said hell but you can go you can have a hundred levels of tunnel going to be on 9999 -99 floors who this is one of the fundamental things people don't appreciate about tunnels is that does not like roads to find another issue with roses that you have a 2d transport system and a 3D living in workspace environment so you got to lose tall buildings or will concentrator work environments and and then then you want to go into this like to t transport some cars upper spaced out pretty far

<timemark seconds="4346" />

and enter the obviously is not going to work are you going to have traffic guaranteed but if you can go 3D on your transport system then you can solve all traffic you can either go 3D up for the flying car on go 3D down with tunnels you can have as many tunnel levels as you want you can rabbit rarely relieve any amount of traffic you can go further down with tunnels and you can go up with buildings your 10,000 feet down if you want

<timemark seconds="4377" />

I would recommend it but what was that movie with what's-his-face Bradley Cooper not Bradley Cooper Christian now what the fuck is named Batman who is Batman Christian Bale where they fight dragons him and Matthew McConaughey

<timemark seconds="4393" />

jab deep into the Earth how high how deep can you go to the airport with a thin crust on the top which we think of is like the surface this thin crust

<timemark seconds="4424" />

and it's mostly just a big ball a lava

<timemark seconds="4429" />

that's worth $10,000 video have you given any consideration whatsoever to the Flat Earth movement haha

<timemark seconds="4439" />

that's a troll situation it's not no it's not

<timemark seconds="4445" />

you would like to think that I cuz you're a Super Genius haha but I as a normal normal person I know the people weighed down more than me and they really really believe they watch YouTube videos which go on uninterrupted and spew out a bunch of fucking fake facts very eloquently and articulately

<timemark seconds="4465" />

and they really believe these people really believe I'm ready for work so I'm sure

<timemark seconds="4473" />

funny vine weird that right that this age where you know is ludicrous mode in your car goes 1.9 seconds 0 to 60

<timemark seconds="4483" />

2.2 2.2 which ones 1.9 the package performance package

<timemark seconds="4501" />

for real what are going to burn ultra high pressure compressed air okay well pump it up like 10,000 PSI and how fast I can fly you make it Fly sure do you anticipate that as being at me you were talking about the tunnels and then flying cars do you really think that's going to be real too noisy air flow so if they finally she was flying cars

<timemark seconds="4539" />

get one of those like toy drones think of how much how loud those are and how much are they how much are they blow now imagine if that's like a thousand times heavier is not going to be make your neighbors happy

<timemark seconds="4554" />

your neighbors are not going to be happy if you land a flying car in your backyard be very helicopter on there or on your roof that are just really going to be like what the hell that was annoying

<timemark seconds="4568" />

if you want to find car just put some wheels on a helicopter is there a way around that like what if they figure out some sort of magnetic technology like all those Bob Lazar type characters were thinking it was a part of the UFO technology they were doing an Area 51 member than they have some some thoughts about magnetics no no bulshit with the air so you must

<timemark seconds="4595" />

you must accelerate the bestest like this you have a mass and your graphic rotational acceleration

<timemark seconds="4605" />

and mass mass times gravity equal the mass of air flow times acceleration about air flow to have a beautiful Force mg is greater than Ma you will go down

<timemark seconds="4621" />

and if Emily is greater than mg you will go up there just no way around that there is definitely no way around it there's no way to create some sort of a magnetic something or another that allows you to

<timemark seconds="4634" />

technically yes you you could have a strong enough

<timemark seconds="4640" />

magnets

<timemark seconds="4643" />

but that might it would be so strong that you would create a lot of trouble you just suck cars up in your car

<timemark seconds="4652" />

just pick up are you closing it after Rappel off of Eva material on the ground or

<timemark seconds="4662" />

in a really naughty Situation off of Earth's gravitational field and somehow make that incredibly light but that magnet would cause so much destruction would be better off with the helicopter so if there was some sort of magnet Road like you have two magnets repel each other get some sort of a magnet row that was below you and you could travel on that magnet road that would work

<timemark seconds="4690" />

hahaha yes yes your kind of magnet Road a magnet world is that too ridiculous it's a lot of things I don't recommend I think I think I was good I would cause a lot of trouble time consideration into this other than you know instead of like my foolish Lee render thoughts so you think the tunnels the way to do it so it'll work for sure that'll work yes and

<timemark seconds="4730" />

your visit these tunnels at your building right now this is basically just like test versions of this ultimate idea that you have

<timemark seconds="4739" />

you know it's just a hole in the ground right we played videos of it where you eat your eyebrows on it and it goes very fast Power Plus girl fast here fast as you want

<timemark seconds="4754" />

I'm going to want to go long distances you can destroy the air out of the tunnel make sure it's real straight

<timemark seconds="4760" />

try the air in the tunnel tunnel then and then depending how fast when I go to these wheels or you could use are bearings depending upon the ambient pressure in the tunnel or you could make love it if you want to go super fast so magnet Road

<timemark seconds="4781" />

yes but underground magnet roads underground maggot realize you're going to really create a lot of trouble with cuz those metal things on the ground you would be an A or B maglev in a vacuum tunnel in a vacuum tunnel levitation

<timemark seconds="4803" />

fun with rocket launchers no I would not recommend putting any exhaust gas out here in the first place I can watch can you breathe you have to pump oxygen into these cubicles

<timemark seconds="4826" />

cuz you have Aaron air plants not getting new Aaron it is it is it like a little hole pump airplanes have it easy because essentially you can they're pretty leaky but yeah but dude

<timemark seconds="4847" />

songs the air pump is working at a decent speed that back up pumps or something and then there's like it doesn't it exhausts through the outflow valve and and through whatever seals are not feeling quite right usually the door doesn't feel quite right on a plane so he's a bit of leakage around the door and the pumps exceed the outflow rate and then that sets the pressure in the in the cabin Texas I still have time for a plane you do a better design I mean

<timemark seconds="4893" />

probably I think it is movie talk to you about this

<timemark seconds="4898" />

and I've talked to friends friends friends and I'm your friend girlfriend so you can tell me

<timemark seconds="4906" />

what you got what's going on

<timemark seconds="4909" />

fun and exciting thing to do would be some sort of electric vertical take-off and Landing supersonic jet

<timemark seconds="4921" />

how to do that

<timemark seconds="4925" />

they do that and some military aircraft correct transition to level flight and then you the thing that you would use for vertical tape for takeoff and Landing is not suitable for high-speed flight

<timemark seconds="4944" />

see if two different systems.

<timemark seconds="4951" />

Thinking about an electric plane is that you want to go as high as possible but you need a sudden energy testing the battery pack because you have to overcome gravitational potential energy wants you to come grab laundry and dryer at a high altitude the energy used in cruise is very low and then you can recapture a large part of your forgot patient 10:20 on the way down so you really don't need any kind of Reserve fuel if you want because you have the energy of height grab his potential energy this is a lot of energy so

<timemark seconds="4988" />

so once you can get high high you like the way you think about a plan is it's a force balance to the force balance

<timemark seconds="4998" />

took a plane that is not accelerating is a neutral force balance

<timemark seconds="5004" />

yeah the force of gravity if a lift force with the wings then you got the force of the one of the thrusting device for the propeller or turbine whatever it is I'm glad you got the resistance force of the air have a higher you go the lower the air resistance is air density drops exponentially but increases with the square and exponential Pizza Square the higher you go the faster you will go for the same amount of energy

<timemark seconds="5036" />

and at a certain altitude you you can go supersonic with less energy from well quite a lot less energy from well then an aircraft at 35000 feet because it's just a force balance

<timemark seconds="5052" />

the stupid first conversation

<timemark seconds="5056" />

it makes sense though I'm sure does now when you think about this

<timemark seconds="5062" />

new idea of of of Designing when you have this idea about improving plants they going to bring this to somebody you just

<timemark seconds="5073" />

truck wash a lot on my plate right now I'm saying

<timemark seconds="5077" />

I don't know I don't know how you do what you do now but if you keep coming up with these it but it's got to be hard to pawn these off on someone else either and Cake go do a job good job with this vertical take-off and Landing system they want to implement to regular planes

<timemark seconds="5094" />

they're playing electric airplane is necessary right now electric cars are important subsonic Utah

<timemark seconds="5108" />

also the plants naturally you really want that gravitational energy density for that craft and thus improving of a time so

<timemark seconds="5119" />

yes it's important we accelerate the transition to a sustainable energy that's why I electric cars matters with electric cars happened sooner or later

<timemark seconds="5128" />

you're really playing

<timemark seconds="5131" />

a crazy game here with the atmosphere of the oceans taking vast amounts of carbon from deep underground and putting this

<timemark seconds="5143" />

maps versus crazy to not do this

<timemark seconds="5148" />

it's very dangerous

<timemark seconds="5153" />

just wish it accelerate the transition to sustainable energy

<timemark seconds="5159" />

I think the thing is that obviously we're going to run out of oil in a long time

<timemark seconds="5166" />

you know when it's only so much oil we can we can line It Burn

<timemark seconds="5171" />

eschatological we must have sister a sustainable energy transport and energy infrastructure in a long time so we know that's the endpoint we know that so why run this crazy experiments or we take coins of tons of carbon from underground and put it in the atmosphere and oceans this is insane experiment just the dumbest experiment in human history

<timemark seconds="5193" />

why we doing this is crazy

<timemark seconds="5198" />

do you think this is a product of momentum that we start off doing this when it was just a few engines a few hundred million gallons of fuel over the whole world not that big of a deal and then slowly but surely over Century it got out of control and now it it's not just our fuel but it's also fossil fuels are involved in so many different Electronics so many different items that people buy it just as constant desire for fossil fuels constant need for oil

<timemark seconds="5232" />

without consideration of the sustainability Welco gas was easy money so have you heard about clean-coal tweeting about it's got to be real Clean Coal all caps do you say use all caps

<timemark seconds="5250" />

kleenco well

<timemark seconds="5255" />

you know it's very difficult to put that CO2 back in the ground doesn't like being in solid form building size filter socks carbon in the atmosphere

<timemark seconds="5269" />

it's impossible

<timemark seconds="5275" />

no. Fuc

<timemark seconds="5280" />

I mean this is quite a complex question

<timemark seconds="5285" />

yeah we're really just went with the more common would take out of the ground and that's the atmosphere and a lot of it gets committed to the oceans the more dangerous it is like I said I don't think right now I think we're okay right now we can probably even add some more but the momentum towards sustainable energy is too slow like a

<timemark seconds="5310" />

does Avast base of Industry

<timemark seconds="5314" />

vast transportation system like this this two and a half billion cause and trucks in the world

<timemark seconds="5320" />

so Pat and ended the new car truck production if it was a hundred percent electric that's only about a hundred million per year so it would take if you could snap your fingers and it's instantly turn all

<timemark seconds="5336" />

old cars and trucks electric it would still take 25 years to change the transport base to Electric

<timemark seconds="5344" />

make sense because how long does a truck car truck last before it goes into the junkyard and gets crushed about 20 to 25 years is there a way to accelerate the process like some sort of subsidies some encouragement from the government financially

<timemark seconds="5361" />

well the thing that is going on right now is that there is a subsidy in any oil burning device power plant or car is fundamentally consuming the carbon capacity of the oceans and atmosphere

<timemark seconds="5379" />

what is the atmosphere for short so I can say okay there's a sudden

<timemark seconds="5385" />

probability of something

<timemark seconds="5388" />

bad happening past a certain carbon concentration in the in the atmosphere and so there's some uncertain number where we put too much carbon in the atmosphere is overheat

<timemark seconds="5403" />

oceans warm up ice caps melt

<timemark seconds="5407" />

ocean real estate becomes a lot less valuable underwater

<timemark seconds="5413" />

and but it's not clear what that number is but it's definitely a scientist would it's really quite the scientist scientific consensus is overwhelming

<timemark seconds="5425" />

overwhelming I mean I don't know I need serious I just actually zero zero we don't think that's quite a serious climate risk that were facing and so

<timemark seconds="5443" />

does fundamentally a subsidy occurring with every

<timemark seconds="5448" />

fossil fuel boat burning thing power plants

<timemark seconds="5452" />

aircraft

<timemark seconds="5454" />

car frankly even Rockets I mean Rockets use up you know they burn they burn fuel

<timemark seconds="5460" />

but this just let me know rockets that just no other way to get to Overton fortunately so it's the only way but with cars that's definitely a better way with electric cars

<timemark seconds="5472" />

and generate the energy do so with photovoltaics because you've got a giant they were nuclear reactor in the sky called the Sun

<timemark seconds="5480" />

great scriptures of everyday very reliable

<timemark seconds="5485" />

so if you can generate energy from solar panels stored with batteries and have energy 24 hours a day

<timemark seconds="5494" />

and then you can

<timemark seconds="5496" />

you can send it to the polls ordinary to the north with in high voltage lines also a lot of hydropower as well

<timemark seconds="5509" />

I'm all old fossil fuel power things have an inherent subsidy which is their consumption of the carbon capacity of the atmosphere and oceans

<timemark seconds="5521" />

so people tend to think like what why should electric vehicles have a subsidy but they're not taking into account that's all

<timemark seconds="5530" />

fossil fuel pump running Vehicles fundamentally are subsidized by the cost the environmental cost to Earth

<timemark seconds="5540" />

but nobody's paying for it we all going to pay for it obviously in the future will pay for it

<timemark seconds="5547" />

it is not paid for now

<timemark seconds="5549" />

what is the bottleneck in regards to electric cars and trucks and things like that is it battery capacity

<timemark seconds="5558" />

yeah go to scale up production how to make a compelling

<timemark seconds="5563" />

make it better than gasoline or diesel cars make it more efficient in terms of like the distance you can travel yeah I got to be able to go far far enough recharge fast you're anticipating 600 miles is that correct

<timemark seconds="5578" />

yeah yeah what is it what is that now make one right now that would be 6 or so to get back to class but it's more so

<timemark seconds="5593" />

well you know just have a ton of kilwa tarp at battery pack and you can go 600 miles do you have now

<timemark seconds="5601" />

330 mile range model S car pack will be about 10:30 Monday 3:35 but some people have hyper mild it to 500 Miles hyper mild it was on level ground with a pump the tires up really well I'm going to smooth surface and and you can go for a long time but definitely we do 300 miles is there any fine for most people usually 200 or 250 miles is fine thread solar powered one day especially in Los Angeles I mean what you said about that giant nuclear reactor a million times bigger than Earth is floating in the sky is it possible that one day you'll be able to use power all these cars

<timemark seconds="5660" />

solar power I mean we don't ever have cloudy days if we do this three of them

<timemark seconds="5667" />

what does the Secretary of a car is

<timemark seconds="5671" />

without making a car like really blocky we're having some like a G-Wagen yeah I like it a lot of stuff there were like maybe like solar panels fold out or something like to eat class that's what we needed that you type yeah that the Jaguar E-Type with a giant long hood that could be a giant solar panel what the hell I did want to have this like unfolding solar panel thing they press a button and we just like unfolding solar panels and like charge recharge your car in the parking lot

<timemark seconds="5704" />

yeah we could do that but I think it's probably better to just put that on your roof right and then it's going to be facing the sun all the time cuz I did the Fisker have that on the roof the Fisker Karma new generation for I said believe it was only for the the radio is that correct recharge like 2 miles a day or so would you laugh when they started blowing up when they get hit with water

<timemark seconds="5733" />

remember what happened they got there they had a dealership Fisker karmas were parked beside like that with a flood in Jersey hurricane came in they got overwhelmed with water and they also do exploding this fucking great video of it did you watch the video and watch the video but I miss you being naked

<timemark seconds="5757" />

watch that video laugh my ass off they all blow up they got wet and they blew up that's not good waterproof so that doesn't happen smart Kazakhstan map that he he just voted through a tunnel under underwater tunnel that could flooded tunnel I just

<timemark seconds="5781" />

turn the wheels to steer and press the accelerator and I just let her through the tunnel and he smoked around the other cars that's amazing on the internet what happens if your car gets a little sideways like if you're driving in snow like what if you're driving if you're autopilot is on and you're in like Denver and it snows out a car gets a little sideways does it correct itself. It's got great car traction control correct you know I like oh yeah oh yeah pretty crazy that's pretty crazy yeah so like if you're going sideways and knows how to correct itself

<timemark seconds="5825" />

Charlie Ward go sideways it won't it will correct itself before it goes sideways even black eyes

<timemark seconds="5833" />

yeah Eustis videos we could see the car the

<timemark seconds="5838" />

that alone traction control system is very good it makes me feel like Superman right you like feel like you're going to make you feel like this incredible driver I believe it in Sweden Norway and Canada and few other places they do a lot of their they do some of their driver training school on these Frozen surfaces so you're just the cars going sideways with you like it or not and you have to learn how to slide into corners and how do we do asked

<timemark seconds="5878" />

electric cars have really great traction control because the reaction time so fast right so you've got a lot of latency takes awhile for the the engine to reactant for before electric motors incredibly precise that's why you're the only you wouldn't have a gasoline engine printer that we pretty weird or or like a surgical device it's going to be an electric motor on the surgical device on the printer

<timemark seconds="5915" />

gasoline engines going to be just driving away it's going to be going to have the reaction time but to an electric motor is operating at the most second level so it can turn on track on and off traction within like inches of getting on the on electricity drive a patch of ice it'll turn traction off and then turn it on a couple inches right after the ice

<timemark seconds="5939" />

little patch of ice

<timemark seconds="5942" />

because in the frame of the electric motor you're moving incredibly slowly you're like a snake your snail you're just moving so slowly

<timemark seconds="5954" />

because if it's a concealed a thousand frames a second

<timemark seconds="5958" />

then it's a recycle say one Mississippi it it just thought about the things a thousand times so it's realize that your wheels are not getting traction it understands are some slippery surface that you driving on and it makes Jocelyn's in real time are you want them to be driving your car yes I'm bored art have the lowest probability of injury of any cars ever tested by the US government

<timemark seconds="6002" />

yeah but it's pretty fun is pretty crazy like you know people still see us like we all have like some accident at 60 miles an hour where they like Twisted an ankle and they slip they seem like they're buried at another car they still see us but that's to be expected expected do you take that into account with like the same sort of fatalistic

<timemark seconds="6026" />

Anita undertones to sort of just go by

<timemark seconds="6029" />

you got to just to let it go this is what people do tell you I've got hurt it is quite a lot of respect for the justice system judges are very smart and they see that I like I have so far I found judge just to be very good at Justice because I like like like watch and jewelry is a good to like they're actually quite good to know people

<timemark seconds="6053" />

are you worried about like occasional errors in the justice system I tell you most of the time they're very good and I fell asleep in the car and he wrote over cyclist and you know what was what encouraged me to get water pilot out as soon as possible like I see what is getting sued you for falling asleep yes he believe I'm not going to blame it on the new car smell

<timemark seconds="6082" />

what yes he blamed him falling asleep on your new car smell this someone is a lawyer as a real thing that had thought that through in front of his laptop for you wrote that shut up

<timemark seconds="6096" />

yes he got a lawyer and he screwed us and the judge was like this is crazy stop bothering me know thank God yes thank God thank God there was a brain plate that is a judge is very good some of them what about that a lot of the river in Pennsylvania who is selling those kids out know about that story was selling young boys to prison he was like literally yeah I literally under bribes for he was elected judge or a politician this is a very famous story he's in jail right now I think for the rest of his life and he put away he he would take a young boy would do something like steal something from the store and he would put them in detention for you know 5 years something we're ridiculous egregious and they investigated this history and they found out that he was literally being paid off

<timemark seconds="6156" />

was it by private prisons is that what the deal was there was some sort of but this judge is to judge Common Pleas judges

<timemark seconds="6170" />

I think they are elected who was paying them

<timemark seconds="6176" />

someone it was proven to point with her in jail now that song was paying them to put more asses in the seats in these private prisons a payment to put them in the youth center's Builder a million-dollar payment that charges in prison yes but people who think perhaps the justice system consists entirely of Judges like that I want to see how are you this is not the case the vast majority of charges of very good they care about Justice and they could have made a lot more money if they wanted to get trailer and instead they cared about Justice and they made less money because they care about Justice and that's why I feel that same way about police officers I feel like there's so many interactions with so many different people with police officers that the very few that stand out that are horrific we we tend to look at that

<timemark seconds="6236" />

this is evidence that police are all crop in that I think that's crazy no most most police are are a very honest person now that I know a very honorable ethical people have to go up to the average person that's why I freshen have to go and obviously if somebody is is given a trusted place in society such as being a police officer or a judge and they all corrupted then we must be extra vigilant that game such situations I take action but we should not think that this is somehow broadly descriptive of people in that profession I couldn't agree more I think there's also an issue with one of the things that happens with police officers prosecutors in anyone is trying to convince someone or arrest someone is that it becomes a game and then games people want to win sometimes people cheat

<timemark seconds="6297" />

yes I mean you know if your prosecutor shoot you should not always want to win. At times when you should like them okay I should not going to win this case and then pass on my case sometimes people want to win too much that is true

<timemark seconds="6319" />

you know what you should do sententious or see a lot of criminals and then your your view of the world can get negatively have a negative

<timemark seconds="6329" />

you're having a good view of the world because you're you're just interacting a lot of criminals but actually most of society is not consist of criminals and had to have this conversation at dinner so we just go with Tony I was like man what sometimes seem pretty very dark because you know there's some things out there and he was like dealing with some case which consisted of a couple of old ladies that would

<timemark seconds="6361" />

run people over somehow for insurance money that was rough

<timemark seconds="6365" />

like wow that's that's that's pretty rough

<timemark seconds="6369" />

as I get my car to maintain faith in humanity if your district attorney but but you know it's only

<timemark seconds="6376" />

a few percent of society that are actually bad and then if you go to the worst state .1% of society weather

<timemark seconds="6384" />

what's 1 + 1000 one in a million damn bad like damn evil the millions of millions for one in a million of evil is so evil people cannot even conceive of it

<timemark seconds="6406" />

but this 330 million people in United States so that 330 people out there somewhere

<timemark seconds="6413" />

but I buy sentricon this will serve 30 people or incredible angels and unbelievably good human beings yeah we tend to I thought Cindy gravitate towards the worst case scenario yes and we want to frame that end of this one of the real problems with prejudice they we want and whether is prejudiced towards different minorities or prejudiced towards police officers or anything so if we want to look at the worst case scenario and say this is an example of what this is all about and you see that even with people how they frame genders some some men find women like that they get ripped off by a few women and they said all women are evil some women get fucked over by a few Min all mentorship and in this this is very toxic and it's it's also it's a very unbalanced way of viewing the world and it's very emotionally based and it's based on your own experience your own anecdotal experience and it can it can be very

<timemark seconds="6473" />

influential to the people around you and it's just too dangerous way it's a dangerous thought process and pattern to promote it is

<timemark seconds="6484" />

people should give other people the benefit of the doubt and assume that they're good until proven otherwise and I really most people are actually pretty good people

<timemark seconds="6495" />

nobody's perfect they have to be if you think I'm a vast numbers of us there just interacting with each other with each other constantly we have to be better than we think we are his weapons like that how many times like nobody's been really try to motivate you and your buddy yet yeah I'm always look mad if I say something that fucked up it's right there at 11 things up for sure

<timemark seconds="6526" />

guaranteed to make any party better I mean that's the armed civilization Theory write an armed Community is the safe in polite community

<timemark seconds="6540" />

you're in Texas kind of true I mean tell me what's going to happen on a good mood piss people off and everybody can have a gun or off just let that guy get in your lane test site in Central Texas near Waco beautiful SpaceX in McGregor Bay cool yeah there you know we have like lots of fire loud explosions and things and people that work sweet you know your kids go to school yeah it's you know it's dangerous

<timemark seconds="6594" />

yeah but if it's free there's something about it's very enticing because of that it is dangerous but it's also free right yeah yeah I prefer over places that are more restrictive but more liberal because you could always be liberal and like just because things are free and just because you have a certain amount of you know right wing type characters it doesn't mean you have to be that way you know and honestly there's a lot of those people that are pretty fucking open-minded and let you do whatever you want to do or I don't bother them

<timemark seconds="6629" />

yeah exactly that's my hope right now with the way we're able to communicate with each other today and how radically different is been Generations past is that we all just the dust settles we all realize I like you you like what you were saying that most people are good the vast majority what mushrooms

<timemark seconds="6657" />

I think they're delicious yeah right you know the good for you to all of them

<timemark seconds="6664" />

all kinds of them

<timemark seconds="6667" />

what do you see in terms of like when you think about the future of your company's what do you see is like bottlenecks

<timemark seconds="6678" />

what do you see in terms of like bottlenecks of things that are that are holding back Innovation is it regulatory commissions and and people that don't understand the technology that are influencing policy what what what could potentially be holding you guys back right now

<timemark seconds="6699" />

is there anything that you would change your question

<timemark seconds="6707" />

you know I wish I wish politicians were better at science that would help a lot that's problem

<timemark seconds="6714" />

yes is no incentive for them to be good at science there isn't

<timemark seconds="6719" />

I'm actually not if they're pretty good at science in China have to say

<timemark seconds="6724" />

yeah the mayor of Beijing ass I believe in environmental engineering degree and the deputy mayor is a Physics degree and met them and the parasite Shanghai is really smart and you're up on technology what do you think about this government policy of of stopping use of Huawei phones and there's there's something about that the the worry about spying I mean from what I understand from Realtek people they think it's horseshit

<timemark seconds="6755" />

oh I'd like the phone. No I don't know they don't you buy Huawei phones

<timemark seconds="6763" />

is that are you up and around now so we just spend the top secret stuff then you want to be pretty careful about what Hardware you use but you know like most people do not have top-secret stuff and like nobody really cares upon you watch it's like nobody really cares you know so that's kind of on them like you just like National spy agencies do not give a rat's ass what I do not care so much Secrets National spy agency have to learn from the average citizen pipe nothing against the narrative in the argument by Logitech people is that the real concern is that these companies like Huawei are innovating at erratic pace and they trying to stop them from integrated into our culture and

<timemark seconds="6823" />

riding this bike right now they're the number to cell phone manufacturer in the world OK Samsung's number one away is number to Apples now number 3 they surpassed Apple's number to and the ideas of this is all had taken place without them having any foothold whatsoever in America there are no there's no carriers that have their phones you have to buy their phones unlocked through some sort of a third party and then put the worry is you know that these are some heart of the controlled by the Chinese government that common is Chinese government is going to distribute these phones and I don't know if it's that the worries economic influence that they'll have too much power I don't know what it is that you you pay attention on it any of this you know maybe

<timemark seconds="6873" />

you know our National Security Agency shouldn't have how well are we friends maybe that's? But I think for the average citizen this doesn't matter

<timemark seconds="6883" />

doesn't just like me I'm pretty sure the Chinese government does not care about the goings-on of the average American citizen is there it is there

<timemark seconds="6896" />

a time will you think that there will be no security will be impossible to hold back information does whatever bottleneck will will let go we're going to we're going to give in the whatever bottleneck between privacy and ultimate Innovation what will have to be bridged in order for us to achieve the next level of technological proficiency that we're just going to abandon it and they'll be no security no privacy do people want privacy cuz they seem to put everything on the internet and this this idea that one day we are going to be able to share information we're going to be some sort of a thing that symbiotically create symbiotically connect in sure but also we will we will be it will be so much different large or concerns about money about status about what all these things were seemingly go by the way

<timemark seconds="6956" />

if we really become enlightened if we really become artificially enlightened by some sort of an AI interface where we have the symbiotic relationship with some new internet type connection to information

<timemark seconds="6973" />

but you know what happens then

<timemark seconds="6977" />

the what what is important what is non important is privacy important when were all gods

<timemark seconds="6985" />

I mean I think the things that we think are important key private right now I probably will not think our Force right information Ryan

<timemark seconds="6998" />

what do you what do you hide emotions what do we hide and I mean it I think like embarrassing embarrassing stuff but there's actually people out there like an off that much Best Kept private that people at that it is actually relevant to other people actually care about you think other people care about it but they don't really care about us and something happens don't some people care about it but then it gets weird when you when it gets exposed like Jennifer Lawrence when I was naked pictures or got exposed in some ways people like them or that they really like the person to just a girl who likes sex and it's just a live in as a boyfriend and sends a messages and now you get to look into it and you probably shouldn't have let somebody let it go and they put it online and then all right

<timemark seconds="7047" />

she seems to be doing okay it's a person she's just you and me and the same thing she just in some weird place where she's on a 35 foot tall screen with music playing every time she talks

<timemark seconds="7062" />

yeah. I'm sure she's just like her face is fully realize where we really do become something far more powerful in terms of our cognitive ability or our ability to understand irrational thoughts and and mitigate them and they were all connected and some sort of an insane way what I mean I would have our thoughts on well our thoughts on social status like how many of those just evaporate and our need for privacy maybe our need for privacy would be the ultimate bottleneck that will have to submit it will have to surpass

<timemark seconds="7106" />

I think the things that we think are important now will probably not be important in the future but they will be things that are important what was he more for things

<timemark seconds="7117" />

I only might be some more of ideas potentially

<timemark seconds="7122" />

I don't think Darwin's going away

<timemark seconds="7124" />

Bratz dolls going to be there

<timemark seconds="7130" />

I'll be there forever forever it would just be a difference in a different Arena

<timemark seconds="7137" />

Karina the digital Arena the Ford Arena

<timemark seconds="7142" />

Thomas not going away

<timemark seconds="7145" />

what keeps you up at night

<timemark seconds="7150" />

was quite hard to run companies

<timemark seconds="7153" />

especially car companies how to say it's quite challenging the cart business is the hardest one of all the things you do

<timemark seconds="7165" />

not the SpaceX SpaceX is no walk in the park but

<timemark seconds="7169" />

but a car company spray difficult cable company alive spray difficult you know there's only two car companies in history of American car companies that haven't gone back Miss Ford and Tesla

<timemark seconds="7184" />

that's it yeah Ford Road out that crazy storm huh they're the only one that's getting their teeth shout out to the Mustang

<timemark seconds="7193" />

Yea Yea by the skin of the teeth that is interesting when I say what we barely survived how close she get to Fulton

<timemark seconds="7201" />

very close where you at

<timemark seconds="7205" />

2008 is not a good time to be a car company especially a startup company and especially an electric car company I was like stupidity squared and this is when you have those cool roadsters with the T-top with Targa Top release chassis the body was completely different but I was a strategy that we actually did dumb

<timemark seconds="7231" />

based on two false premises one false premise was that would be able to cheaply convert the Lotus Elise and use that as

<timemark seconds="7242" />

car platform and that we would be able to use technology from the store company called AC propulsion for the electric drivetrain and the battery is

<timemark seconds="7254" />

Facey propulsion technology to not working production and we ended up using none of it a long time none of it to resign everything and then the once you add a battery pack an electric motor to a card got to have your kinetic sand heavier invalidated the entire structure or lacrosse structure of everything has to be redone

<timemark seconds="7276" />

nothing like I think it had less than 7% of the parts were common with any other device including cars or anything

<timemark seconds="7285" />

7% yes everything including tires and wheels bolts

<timemark seconds="7291" />

breaks even as hearing well see the steering wheel was almost the same as the windscreen less than 7% so that's basically the entire structure is different the H2 like the HVAC system that the view of the air conditioner with a belt driven air conditioner

<timemark seconds="7328" />

and all that takes away from the battery life as well right yeah we need small highly efficient air conditioning system that fit in a tiny car and was electrically-powered not belt driven

<timemark seconds="7339" />

it's very difficult how much does where those cars 2750 to make that and what was the weight distribution

<timemark seconds="7355" />

it was about

<timemark seconds="7357" />

dirty versions of the car so is about 55 on the rear cuz it was the most popular sports cards of all-time heavy rear end by us well I mean yeah the spice Newton not being on their side I get fighting you can it's very difficult well if you got those any sense they do once you understand them once you understand what I hang the engine so fast this is not a wise move you don't want to let up on the gas when you're in a corner the phone was up with Widow with whistling that's where the engine is mouse over the rear axle or off the rear axle towards the rear they pull number in Russia is fundamentally screwed you cannot solve this is unsolvable

<timemark seconds="7414" />

just wondered if you're screwed

<timemark seconds="7418" />

bright like it seems like if you spawn the car like a top

<timemark seconds="7423" />

but that's your problem if you're just

<timemark seconds="7428" />

false evidence Wireless show by the way I realize you're fucking Elon Musk do whatever you want man

<timemark seconds="7443" />

you're getting confused call me

<timemark seconds="7446" />

elsewhere in private square up a storm to say freaking it's fun way the old house moms have children this freaking thing better I like the looks of the Porsche 912 Porsche handles given that it's the physics to actually still make it work well is incredible if you know how to turn into the corner once you get used to the feeling of it there's actual benefits to it you know that there are some benefits the car I had before Tesla was a 911 okay how's 997 or 6

<timemark seconds="7491" />

great Carmen Schneider where they had the variable vane turbo and you didn't have the black guy with great florek like Photo home Claremont the older one or something fun about it though I like the feeling that we're weight kicking around you know what I was talking about earlier about that little car that I have 93 911 Assist it's not fast just not the son of the best handling car but it's more satisfying than any other car I have because it's so mechanical it's like everything about it like crack holes and bumps and he gives you his feedback and I take it to the comedy store because when I get there I feel like my brain is just popping and Sunfire at it's like a strategy for me now

<timemark seconds="7552" />

that I I really stop driving other cars there I drive that car there just for the brain juice just for the in the in the interaction

<timemark seconds="7562" />

are you should try Model S p100d I'll try to blow your mind skull okay tell me what to order I'll order it Model S p100d okay Jamie just looked car that I drive okay okay I'll get with the car drive okay that's good regular days you'll never notice the battery never never how hard is it to get like one of them crazy plugs installed in your house. Difficult now it's like it's like a dryer Outlet come up with some crazy tiles for your roof that are solar paneled because Russe at the last one time you want to leave for Ruth the last like

<timemark seconds="7622" />

February 1st new you don't replace the roof you want to put like so pound on the front so that's like retrofit you know I never try to make the record for pounds look real nice but they're not the new product coming out with is if you if you have a roof that's either you're building a house or you're going to replace a roof anyway then you make the site the tiles have solar cells embedded in the tiles and then it's quite a tricky thing because you want to not see the solar cell behind the book The Glass Tile so you have to really work with the

<timemark seconds="7657" />

the glass and end the end of the rarest Coatings and layers so that you don't see the solar cell behind the glass didn't look right so it's really tricky stain put it up there yeah and it looks good see more closely you can see the cell but if you zoom out well looks cool though yeah that's really hard because you have to go through when it gets reflected back out it doesn't act up as a seller now are those available to the consumer right now we have proof right there that's amazing

<timemark seconds="7703" />

that looks good yeah I like that one as far as you get that kind of fake Spanish looking thing I like that that's why people in Connecticut smoking pipes that one yeah that's badass dude so I don't actually work I believe you the solar panels that are on that house that we looked at is that sufficient to power the entire home

<timemark seconds="7732" />

it depends on your energy

<timemark seconds="7738" />

generally yes I would say it's probably for most it's going to vary but it anywhere from more than you need to maybe half black half to 145 of the energy that you need depending on how much proof you have relative to living space and how ridiculous you are with the TV is no problem there can you stack air conditioning in stupid is the problem if you have an efficient air conditioner and you don't depend on how are you a conditioning rooms when they don't need to be a conditional release by common cause pain in the neck music program your VCR like

<timemark seconds="7780" />

Brian that's just the blinking 12 I'll tell people just like the hell with that I was going to make it this time after all day long if you're in the room that it stays cool right I'll be home and then cool the room the room that you're likely to use with a little bit of intelligence we're not talking about like genius home here was talking like Elementary basic stuff from

<timemark seconds="7806" />

but you know like if you could hook that into the car next to me was you coming home like an open mind fooling the home we're going to come home really cool when you're not there I can tell that you're coming home was going to call it the right temperature right now after works with your solar panels or anything like that

<timemark seconds="7824" />

yeah and we need to hook it up to a conditioning to a really make the air conditioning while have you thought about creating an air conditioning system I know you have

<timemark seconds="7836" />

trick question

<timemark seconds="7840" />

answer questions about future Patel okay let's just let it go and move on to the next thing that would be interesting I do yeah I would say radiant heating all that good ideas that when you when you think about the efficiency of these homes and you think about implementing solar power and battery power and is there anything else that people are missing is there any other like I just saw a smartwatch that is powered by the heat of the human body

<timemark seconds="7871" />

some new technology it's able to fully power that way I don't know if it's okay or if it's I just watch her here this is a Casio it's called a Protech and it's in like an outdoor watching solar powered and so it has the ability to operate for a certain amount of time on solar function for a certain amount of time I saw her like there's a self-winding watches where it has just got to wait and watch and as you move your wrist that the way it moves from one side to the other on and it said white wines to watch up that's a pretty cool thing Rolex is that it's all done mechanically there's no batteries in there is no nothing that's based on wrist movement but it really depends on how much energy to watch uses about 2 weeks after certain amount of like fuckery with those watches like I brought my watch I have a Rolex that my friend Lorenzo gave me and I brought it to the watch store

<timemark seconds="7931" />

and I said this thing's always fast I said it's always like after a couple months like 5 minutes fast and they go yep

<timemark seconds="7940" />

because it's just what it does to go hold on I go see you telling me that it just is always going to be fast they said yeah it's just like every few months you got to like reset it to recalibrate that thing they can't they tried they say every few months with its 4 months 5 months or 6 months going to be a couple minutes fast okay seems like they recalibrate that because if it's always fast you know delete those minutes to fucking kick down the door at Rolex and go you bitches are lazy it's amazing I mean though the whole luxury watch Market is fascinating I'm not that involved in an intern like I don't buy them I bought them as gifts I don't buy them for myself but when I look at them online with your million-dollar watches out there now they're like they have like little rotating Moons and stars and they they live like look at this thing

<timemark seconds="8000" />

is African Preposterous I like yours love them but there's some of these people have just taken it right in the ass than buying these watches for like $750,000 Mike yo that's a Timex Sun nobody knows it's not any better than some Casio that you can just buy online like we do that though here's the thing if your person it doesn't just want to know the time you want craftsmanship you want some Artisans touch you want innovation in terms of like a person figuring out how gears and cogs all line up perfectly to every time it turns over it's basically a second if that's just part 2 that it's a great yes not just telling time that I like this watch a lot but if it got hit by a rock I wouldn't be sad it's just a watch it's a mass produce thing that runs on some courts battery

<timemark seconds="8060" />

but those things that's the shark at at

<timemark seconds="8064" />

beautiful yeah yeah yeah there's something something amazing about it it's a because it represents the human creativity it's not just it's not just electronic Innovation there's something is this a person work in that yes

<timemark seconds="8083" />

you have watch on

<timemark seconds="8085" />

now have I used to have a watch what happened my friend tells the time was you lose your phone you wait hold on let me guess you are an okay Sky that's correct marveled is ability to get through life without a case that's right you know he takes his phone and he flips in between his fingers like like like a soldier would do with his rifle rolls at shed in between his fingers and he says that's the reason why they do it you said would you look

<timemark seconds="8128" />

add someone who has a rifle why would they do that why would they flip it around like that

<timemark seconds="8135" />

it goes to drop they have in their hand they catch it quickly he does with his phone he's just flipping his phone around all the time I got that Mexico I was hoping it holds joints

<timemark seconds="8146" />

does it do anything to fix open it just alcoholic the whole storage stories in there but like

<timemark seconds="8153" />

try to put a joint near close it you put like one one blunt

<timemark seconds="8158" />

one but seems pretentious you know that's the idea behind it I bought it cuz I figured but good size to hold joints

<timemark seconds="8171" />

horse not

<timemark seconds="8175" />

is that a joint

<timemark seconds="8179" />

voice of a cigar marijuana and tobacco probably can't cuz stockholders right

<timemark seconds="8195" />

I mean it's legal right totally go okay at you if you do certain things

<timemark seconds="8203" />

backhoe and marijuana there

<timemark seconds="8210" />

does the combination of tobacco and marijuana is wonderful

<timemark seconds="8214" />

first turned on do it by Charlie Murphy and then reignited by Dave Chappelle

<timemark seconds="8225" />

grandfathered in

<timemark seconds="8234" />

fine yeah a little sip here and there and you just see your inhibitions are relaxed and shows your true self and hopefully you're more joyous and friendly and happy and and everything's good

<timemark seconds="8246" />

the real worry is the people that can't handle it like they're real worried about people can't handle cars that can go 0 to 60 in 1.9 seconds or anything

<timemark seconds="8256" />

have you ever considered something that like imagine if one day everyone has a car that's on the same at least technological standard as one of your cars and everyone agrees that the smart thing to do is not just to have bumpers but to perhaps have some sort of a magnetic repellent device something some electro magnetic field around the cars race cars come close to each other day automatically radically decelerate because of

<timemark seconds="8286" />

magnets or something

<timemark seconds="8288" />

well I mean I cause break automatically break when they see things

<timemark seconds="8297" />

will the wheels were pretty well as revealed that kind of thing that one day all your cars be on the road and then they'll still be regular people with regular cars 20 30 years from now.

<timemark seconds="8319" />

get in the mix and beat them the main problem

<timemark seconds="8323" />

yeah I think it speaks or like it was a time of transition where they were horses and gasoline cars in the road at the same time it's been pretty weird yeah you know I'm back in Manhattan had like three hundred thousand horses

<timemark seconds="8340" />

I figure like

<timemark seconds="8342" />

horse lives 15 years got 20 thousand horses. Dropping dad everyday or every year should say every year 20000 horses of his thousand horses

<timemark seconds="8354" />

back in The Gangs of New York days

<timemark seconds="8357" />

that movie. What am I dragging this dead horse around and I'm a horse

<timemark seconds="8378" />

do you ever sit and think about your role in Civilization different stop and think about your role in the culture cuz me as a person never met you until today when I think of you you know I've always thought of you as being this weirdo super inventor dude who just somehow or another keeps coming up with new shit

<timemark seconds="8398" />

but there's not a lot of you out there like everybody else seems to be I mean obviously you make a lot of money there's a lot of people to make a lot of money you like that clock is right I'll get you one okay done I like weird things like this this is the coolest TGT promotion what is his TGT Studios TGT Studios gentleman who makes all this by hand

<timemark seconds="8426" />

that's really cool might study is filled with weird devices well get ready for another one alright I'm sending it your way you want a werewolf to hook you up

<timemark seconds="8437" />

Alright Ok Google why do werewolf and one coming up do you think about your role in the culture cuz me as a person ever met you until today I've always liked to do in Pollock houses guys keep inventing shit like how do you how do you keep coming up with all these new devices and what do you ever consider how unusual like I had a dream once that there was a million Tesla's instead of like one Tesla there was a million Tesla's not just leave the car but Nicola there's a million people like him who were radically Innovative it was a weird dream was so strange and I've had it more than once it's one of the only dreams in my life I've had more than one time okay I'm in the same dream and in this dream it's 1940s 1950s but

<timemark seconds="8497" />

everyone is severely Advance there's flying blimps with like LCD screens in the side of them and everything is bizarre and strange

<timemark seconds="8506" />

and it's stuck with me for whatever it obviously was just a stupid dream but for whatever reason all these years that's stuck with me like it takes one man like Nikola Tesla to have more than a hundred inventions that were patents right I mean he had some pretty great pretty fucking amazing ideas but there was his day there was very few people like him that was true what if there was a million like what in the end

<timemark seconds="8542" />

do you think about that are you try to not

<timemark seconds="8557" />

I don't think I don't think it necessarily want to be me

<timemark seconds="8561" />

well what's the worst part about you people would like it that much what most people wouldn't but they can't be you so that's like

<timemark seconds="8570" />

I'll take some superhero type shit you know what am I to be Spider-Man sleep tight and Gotham City I hope he's out there doing his job

<timemark seconds="8580" />

it's very hard to turn it off yeah what's the hardest part might sound great Sean

<timemark seconds="8589" />

now I showed you the isolation tank and you've never experienced that before so I think that could help you turn it off a little bit just for the night yeah just give you a little bit of sleep little bit of perspective magnesium that you get from the water as well that makes you makes you sleep easier because the water is Epsom salts in it but maybe some sort of strategy for sacrificing your biological not sacrificing butt enhancing your biological recovery time by figuring out a way with words to meditation or some other ways to shut off that that thing at night

<timemark seconds="8626" />

but you must have like a constant stream of ideas it's running through your head all the time

<timemark seconds="8634" />

getting text messages from checks no I'm getting text messages from what the hell are you doing smoking weed is legal

<timemark seconds="8648" />

it's got me an approved it's not you know I'm not a regular smoker of weed

<timemark seconds="8661" />

let me know if I don't actually notice any of fact why don't they go there was a time where I think it was Ron Dons for someone gave some Buddhist monk bunch of acid okay 8 it no effect on

<timemark seconds="8676" />

I doubt that I would say that too but I've never meditated to the level that some of these people out where they're constantly meditating all day they don't have any material possessions and all of their energy is spent trying to achieve a certain mindset I would like to cynically deny that I'd like to send you this a contagious fucking think the same way I do they just hang out with flip flops on and make weird noises but maybe know a lot of people like weed and that's fine but I don't find that is very good for productivity for you or for me

<timemark seconds="8720" />

Someone Like You album All a cup of coffee right you want to Yerba mate what do you know I'm saying you would like more more like will be beneficial to you would be like coffee I like to get things done like for useful that is one of the hardest things to do when you say you lied to get things done like in terms of like what you satisfaction when you complete a project on something something that you invent come to fruition and you see people enjoying it that feeling

<timemark seconds="8758" />

yes doing something useful for other people but I like doing

<timemark seconds="8763" />

that's interesting for other people

<timemark seconds="8767" />

yes so that you think the dad is maybe the way you recognize that you have these unusual position in the culture where you can uniquely influence certain things because of this mean you sexually have a gift right I mean it's easy to take it was a curse but I'm sure it's been fueled by many many years of discipline and learn learning but you essentially have a gift and that you have this

<timemark seconds="8797" />

radical sort of creativity engine when it comes to Innovation and Technology you're going at a very high RPMs all the time what is that why is this stuff

<timemark seconds="8811" />

I don't know what would happen if I got into a sensory deprivation tank most sounds concerning

<timemark seconds="8819" />

what's running the engine

<timemark seconds="8821" />

with no resistance that maybe it's not maybe it's fine I don't know have you ever experimented with meditation or anything what do you do I would have you done rather

<timemark seconds="8841" />

and we just sort of sit there and be quiet and then repeat some mantra

<timemark seconds="8848" />

which acts as a focal point

<timemark seconds="8851" />

it's just still the mind I just don't mind

<timemark seconds="8855" />

but I don't find myself drawn to it frequently

<timemark seconds="8860" />

do you think that perhaps productivity is maybe more attractive to you than Enlightenment and I or even the concept of whatever Enlightenment means like what are you trying to cheat when you're meditating all the time which would view it seems like almost like there's a franticness to your creativity that comes out of this this burning furnace and fruit in order for you to like, that thing down your throat might have to throw too much water on it

<timemark seconds="8891" />

it's like a never-ending explosion

<timemark seconds="8895" />

I wouldn't like I try to explain it to a dumb person like me

<timemark seconds="8902" />

what's going on in Neverending explosion it's just constant ideas just bouncing around

<timemark seconds="8909" />

damn yeah it's when everybody leaves just Elon sitting at home brushing his teeth

<timemark seconds="8916" />

just punch ideas bounce around your head all the time

<timemark seconds="8922" />

when did you realize that that's not the case with most people

<timemark seconds="8931" />

I think when I was I don't know if I was 6 or something I thought I was insane

<timemark seconds="8936" />

why'd you think you're insane because it's fair that other people do not

<timemark seconds="8941" />

what their mind wasn't exploding with ideas. I'm expressing it they weren't you realize by the time we were five or six oh they're probably not even getting this thing that I'm getting

<timemark seconds="8954" />

no it's just strange who is like

<timemark seconds="8960" />

I'm strange that was my question answering did you feel diminished by then anyway like knowing this is a weird thing that you really probably couldn't commiserate with with other people they will do it I understand you when you were little girl order to put me away like when you were little you thought this wow

<timemark seconds="8989" />

but you thought this is so radically different than the people that are around me if they find out I got the stream coming in

<timemark seconds="8996" />

yeah wow

<timemark seconds="9001" />

yeah I was only like 5 or 6 though

<timemark seconds="9004" />

do you think this is like I mean there's there's outliers biologically

<timemark seconds="9011" />

you mean there's people that are 7 foot 9 there's people have giant hands as people that have eyes that are 20/15 vision is always outliers

<timemark seconds="9023" />

you feel like you are caught this like you have got some you like on some weird

<timemark seconds="9030" />

Innovation creativity sort of wave that's very unusual

<timemark seconds="9036" />

are you tapped into the various things you've been able to accomplish in a very short amount of time and you're constantly doing this that's a weird you're weird person right by Grace what if there's a million Elon musk's

<timemark seconds="9055" />

well that would be very weird

<timemark seconds="9060" />

woo yeah you're pretty weird like real weird that's why

<timemark seconds="9066" />

yeah but it's early and show Rockettes the probably is

<timemark seconds="9077" />

I mean I think that's the case with the a lot of folks

<timemark seconds="9081" />

yeah I mean but like I am I goes like kind of useful things

<timemark seconds="9088" />

how to maximize probably the future is good computer exciting something you look forward to

<timemark seconds="9098" />

help with the

<timemark seconds="9102" />

it was Tesla I would like to make things that people love feels like nothing by that you really love that really give you Joy so rare So Rare I wish there were more things

<timemark seconds="9117" />

that's what I try to do is make things that somebody loves when you when someone loves like do you specifically think about like what things would improve people's experience like what what would change the way people interface with life that would make them more relaxed or more happy

<timemark seconds="9139" />

you really think

<timemark seconds="9141" />

like when you thinking about things like that is that like one of your consideration like what could I do that would help people that maybe they wouldn't be able to figure out

<timemark seconds="9150" />

Daleks like what are the set of things that can be done to make the future better

<timemark seconds="9157" />

you know like so I think that future where we are space-faring civilization and out there Among the Stars

<timemark seconds="9166" />

this is very exciting this makes me look forward to the future

<timemark seconds="9170" />

makes me want that future

<timemark seconds="9173" />

and other things

<timemark seconds="9175" />

I need to be things that make you look forward to waking up in the morning you wake up in the morning look forward to the day for to the Future

<timemark seconds="9185" />

a future where we are space-faring civilization and out there Among the Stars I think that's very exciting that was a thing we want

<timemark seconds="9193" />

where is if you knew we would not be a spacefaring civilization before ever confined to a this would not be a good future that would be very sad think it would be so I want to see the finite lifespan of the Earth itself in the solar system itself but even though it's possibly not mean how many how long do they feel like this sun in the solar system is going to exist how many hundreds of millions of years

<timemark seconds="9220" />

well probably if you're saying that when does the sun boil the ocean

<timemark seconds="9227" />

about 500 million years so is it sad that we never leave because in 500 million years that happens is that what you're saying

<timemark seconds="9238" />

no I just think like there are two Futures and one future is were out there among the stars and things we read about in Sea and science fiction movies the good ones are true we have these starships and forever

<timemark seconds="9253" />

which we going to see what other planets are like and where multi-planet species in the scope and scale of Consciousness is expanded

<timemark seconds="9262" />

crossed many civilizations in many planets many Star systems this is a great future

<timemark seconds="9270" />

this is a wonderful thing to me and that's what we should strive for

<timemark seconds="9277" />

that's biological travel that sells traveling physically to another location yes

<timemark seconds="9286" />

do you think that's definitely where we're going no yeah I don't think so either I used to think so and now I'm thinking more likely less

<timemark seconds="9296" />

they never like almost every day less likely we can definitely go to the moon and Mars

<timemark seconds="9307" />

Saturn Vue get to Pluto that be the craziest place ever if we colonize Mars Andre terraformed it and turned it into like a big Jamaica

<timemark seconds="9317" />

this title should I think that I'm a great amazing

<timemark seconds="9327" />

well I mean overtime wouldn't be easy but it's you could just want you can warm it up yeah you can get some water there I mean overtime hundreds of millions of years whatever it takes I'm also planets that would be amazing I want to be me too

<timemark seconds="9349" />

yeah me too I think it's great we're glad as a robot that you love humans cuz we we love you too and we don't want you to kill us and eat us and strangely I think a lot of people don't like you're mad at me and say those blinds but I do not but I think one of those I think part of that it's just I've been you know they've been struggling some people struggle they Associated struggle with other people they never internalizing problems they looked other people as holding them back and people suck and fuck people and it's just you know so never never ending cycle

<timemark seconds="9386" />

but not always again most people

<timemark seconds="9391" />

a really good most people vast majority this may sound corny it does sound corny but it has the answer answer it is because we're all scared you know we're all scared of trying to love people being rejected or

<timemark seconds="9409" />

someone take advantage of you because you were trying to be loving but if we all could just relax and love each other

<timemark seconds="9418" />

what hurt to have more love in the world wouldn't hurt to be great yeah we should do that yeah I agree man

<timemark seconds="9431" />

now that's probably spend more time with your friends and less time on social media deleting social media from your applications from your phones and then they give you 10% booster happiness was with percentages

<timemark seconds="9451" />

I think probably something like that yeah yeah I could 10% I mean

<timemark seconds="9458" />

I mean the only thing I've kept is Twitter because I kind of like need some means of getting a message out you know Ryan

<timemark seconds="9466" />

that's about it

<timemark seconds="9469" />

so far so good well what's interesting with you you is actually occasionally engage with people on Twitter

<timemark seconds="9477" />

what percentage of that is a good idea haha

<timemark seconds="9483" />

good quality 10%

<timemark seconds="9492" />

Taurus mostly I think it's unbalanced more good than bad but there's definitely some bad

<timemark seconds="9499" />

so do you ever play the Good outweighs the bad do you ever think about how audit is the weird feeling that you get when someone says something shitted you on Twitter and you read it the weird feeling is weird little negative Joel so I guess objective negative jolt of energy don't really need to absorb but you do anyway I want to fuck was gar

<timemark seconds="9521" />

I mean there's a lot of negativity on Twitter it is but it's a weird it's in its form like the way if you ingest it as if you were like you try to be a little scientist as you're ingesting it weird is this that I'm even getting upset and some strange person saying something mean to me

<timemark seconds="9540" />

sun even accurate

<timemark seconds="9543" />

I mean there are vast number of negative comments so vast for the vast majority of I just ignore them like I said it's not good make mistakes yes you can make his own mistakes we're all human we can make mistakes

<timemark seconds="9564" />

it's hard and people love it when you say something and you take it back and I fuck you we saved it for ever fucking screenshot that shit bitch you had that thought you had that thought like well I deleted it. Good enough you had the thought I'm better than you I never had that thought you had that thought you piece of shit look I saved it I put it on my blog yeah I hear what people think about it that anyone would think that's releasing it sweet makes it go away it's like hello Internet for a while yeah they don't Brown you to be able to delete it because the problem is if you don't delete it and you don't believe it anymore it's really hard to say hey that thing above I don't really believe that anymore I changed the way I view things people give a fuck you I have that over there I'm going to just take that America to pay attention that shit you wrote underneath it it's on your permanent record forever

<timemark seconds="9624" />

so your tattoo you keep it yeah it's it's a there's a lack of compassion so lack of compassion issue people just like intentionally shity to each other all the time online and try to catch that fits Adam or trying to catch people doing something that's arrested ball like a cop trying to like get arrests on his his record like to try to catch you with something more than their logically looking at it thinking it's a bad thing that you've done or if it's an idea they don't agree with so much and you didn't salt you trying to catch you it's way easier to be mean on social media than it is to be mean in person yes way easier it's not a normal way of human interacting it's cheating and I'm supposed to be able to interact so easily but people are not looking at yes you would never do that you don't be so mean to somebody looking in their eyes if you did you'd feel like shit

<timemark seconds="9684" />

yeah unless you're sociopath you feel terrible yes

<timemark seconds="9691" />
