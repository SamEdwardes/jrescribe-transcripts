The Joe Rogan Experience

<timemark seconds="510" />

all day

<timemark seconds="512" />

welcome back jogo what's happening baby it's good to be here good to see man we're just talking about Chris Cornell found out last night at The Comedy Store that he died and then this morning found out that he hung himself

<timemark seconds="526" />

fuck yeah it's it's hard to even comprehend how do you comprehend that I'm living in a parallel universe doesn't make any sense like how could someone like you know it's easy on the outside looking in a guy like that be like that guy was one of the best ever like how does a guy like that even want to kill himself how did the lead singer of Soundgarden to me it is really kind of feels the complexities of human life of his skill of the Pinnacle of Fame The Pinnacle of money and then for him to say you know what not going to do it anymore yeah I don't I don't know what was going on in his head obviously who knows what if he was on medication if you had some sort of an issue a health issue of who knows me that I would never speculate but I just I don't understand

<timemark seconds="579" />

I mean again I don't know his life but I knew I couldn't even comprehend I can't even imagine it what's that's one of the really hard things when you start talking about suicide or people that for someone like me and I haven't had suicidal thoughts right so when you when you go from that to somebody that not only has the thoughts but then goes ahead and execute it is very hard to comprehend have my people that have done it before I've met I've added a few friends are done it I just have never understood it I don't get it but I don't know them you know I mean everybody's got their own unique mindset just know what's really crazy man is already statistic the other day about suicide that people in poor neighborhoods are far less likely to kill himself people that are in the struggle yeah well I actually believe that cuz they're fighting for something and someone that's already got everything and then there was an end up with no drive with no goal and nothing left to achieve

<timemark seconds="639" />

so then all the sudden they're just staring at the mirror without anyone else to go. I'm not talking about Chris Cornell and in particular but for some people I know one of the things that happens is that when they become very successful and they're still not happy then they get hopeless they just feel like well I have everything and yet I'm fucking miserable you know I have a nice big house I drive this fancy car and I still am miserable like there's no hope I just life is meaningless

<timemark seconds="669" />

I don't even know what to say to that I don't know what to say to be honest with you and you just don't even know what to say to that I like struggle I like it I think it's important no doubt about that there's no doubt about having something that you're striving for some goal and achieved and now you're sitting there at the top of the mountain and now you don't feel happy what are you do just pick up a fucking hobby man find something you suck at and get better at it I mean that seems so simplistic but you know I just you and I are we share this very important part of our Lives which is intense exercise with indeed and I think that you know I go to your Instagram almost every day to look at your watch it's hilarious if you go to Jocko's Instagram it's a fucking Timex watch advertisement it's all

<timemark seconds="729" />

his fucking hairy gorilla arm Ironman Triathlon Watch Once you do do that hears a thing like you know like a friend of mine said that is like I was saying something about you could come on the podcast any of those can that do take another picture was fucking Mark watch every day until he dies I go it's important it's it's it's it's sort of in a lot of ways it's symbolic of what we're talking about like no it's not fun to look everyday but you fucking do it everyday that's what's important early on I had someone you know say something along the lines of on social media on Instagram on Twitter going to post another picture while I was like on the follow me. Just don't follow me it's no big deal I'm not making you do it and now it is kind of turned into something where I'm doing it every day regardless of anything else in the world

<timemark seconds="789" />

I want to know when I get upset but it is a lot of ways it is it symbolic of what we're talking about it's the struggle yeah you know about and I always make it a point to there's like a a single mom somewhere in the valley here that's working three jobs that's getting up at 3:30 in the morning so she can go work as a waitress somewhere before she's got her other day job that she's got to go through so she can feed her kids, retired guy from the from the military so I can sort of but you also get up because that's who you are and I get up because it is is a way to maintain discipline in life for sure to get that stone out and sharpen that blade every morning it's the grinder to sharpen the axe indeed

<timemark seconds="849" />

and I don't want to say that this would have saved Chris Cornell or anybody else I did it I'm not saying that but I mean for some people out there that aren't feeling good man if you just fucking struggled more you get over that struggle you feel better that sounds so simplistic but I swear by it myself to see I had I had you know I had Tim Ferriss come on my pocket so he came on he was like hey I don't know if I'm the right kind of guests for your podcast cuz you know my pocket and killing and all that stuff and so are about being better and stuff like that so it's easy to contract and he said to me you may I don't know if if I'd come on the podcast but you know maybe I'm not the right type of gas or whatever and I and I wrote back to him and I said hey man you know you've been through some dark stuff in your life because he wrote a blogpost years ago

<timemark seconds="909" />

about him being suicidal and him contemplating and planning to commit suicide this is Tim Ferriss to library I got a bunch of books on killing yourself and then did the research on how he's going to do it and planned it all and then you don't tell me he was going he was like just done with college and so I mean what is that at 2:35 or something so maybe it's 20 15 years ago and he wasn't working out and it was just problematic and so he started saying what's up OK Google how am I getting out of this well there's one way to get out of it and luckily you didn't do it but when he came on you know that's what we talked about and what he said you know as he was making recommendations from again from a guy who's been there was like eight if you're trapped in your in your mind and you start to feel that way and go do something physical get in your body get out of your mind the same thing you're saying it when you're feeling bad when you're feeling down

<timemark seconds="969" />

go out and swing a kettlebell round and you will feel better yeah this is just too much for some people especially their just experienced in way too much pressure and that that that pressure a lot of times it's just out an imbalance in perspective and some of its input like I was talking to his mom wants her daughter does gymnastics with my daughter and we were talking about kids killing themselves where she used to live she used to live in one of the really wealthy Tech areas outside of San Francisco and a bunch of kids that went to school with her daughter that were like 15 16 or jump off Bridges and shit like it was like an epidemic and they're trying to figure out what the fuck is going on in there literally calling it affluenza that these a fluid kids and their their families are literally worth a billion dollars you know I mean everybody's super rich and they're having this insane pressure be like before high school in high school to be an Ivy League schools in to get 4.0 and they're fucking they're not having any fun

<timemark seconds="1029" />

and they don't have any hope in their parents are all the fucking pills and they're just killed themselves as a piece of perspective because if you think about when you want one of your buddies go down the downward spiral maybe it's not the suicide but whether it's drug addiction a lot of time some female the girlfriend the ex-wife will just take him on the downward spiral and they can't get out of it if they would have stepped back if it were if it was you and your buddy watching one of your other friends go down that's why they call my God I can't believe he's doing that that's crazy but when you're not spiral people get caught in that they can't they can't get the perspective of what it looks like from the outside yeah it's hard for people to break momentum to the momentum it's good momentum for mental momentum is bad Memento when I get when I get on a good Groove working out all the time I feel it like after I'm done working again I can't wait to workout again that's the good momentum but then is that bad you get injured or something like that for a couple weeks and then

<timemark seconds="1089" />

motor up again I've caught some Flack for saying it was easy science experiments or something in the end they said that will power dissipated throughout the day and in the more decisions you have to make the weaker you get throughout the day I think that's BS lunch time you're not saying Hey where's the pizza where's the today as opposed to exactly what you're saying which is when you sleep in you skip your workout all the sudden the donuts are starting to look pretty good and then continue on for days in the days during the week and the next thing you know you're fat and out of shape

<timemark seconds="1149" />

it's a little out of people to read and shit food and then by the end of the day your body is in a crisis yep yep I just processing all this bullshit wake up around 4:35 and 1/2 hours to turn in my first question is what are you eating what are you eating cuz if you're eating Cheetos and chocolate chip cookies for lunch there's no way you're going to feel good and I don't care if you slept 12 hours a night before eating a Big Slice bulshit lunch filled with nonsense like your body's got to process all that stuff until the end of the day you're going to lose your willpower so like 156 rolls around you going to be tired but if you have a healthy lunch and you know you're with your properly fueled and then you also have positive people in your life everyone's motivated by the end of the day you're going to feel good like see if you're if you're doing Juju

<timemark seconds="1209" />

a bunch of other people are doing Jiu-Jitsu everybody's enjoying it you looking forward to that 6:30 class everybody's fired up you get out of work you fucking pumped man when you get out of work with water trying to get some electrolytes in you cuz you know you're going to get out there on the mat so you going to sweat it out when you get done with work and with a grind and you didn't get me gate crappy food and whatever happened happened and you got yelled at by your boss or whatever and the real easy decision is be like I'm not going to rain tonight those the night you got to drink cuz that is going to kick you back on the track real quick when you get in there and you see your boys and their on the mats and that's going to get you on track as opposed to going home and watching TV which is going to do anything for you you know filled with bulshit well then hey dummy don't eat shity lunch tomorrow tomorrow try a nice salad and I'll try salad with some salmon and see how you feel then you

<timemark seconds="1269" />

your decision making a significant to the fucking Cheetos chocolate chip cookie route you just making a shit your carving your fucking path for broken rocks and glass and is not the way to go no doubt that the decision is in one big decision that you make it smell these little thing and then you make the right decision on those little things that's where that's where the change a refrigerator she the Coca-Cola right next to the water just collect just do it look like I did it I grab the water listen water doesn't taste good compared to Coca-Cola if your body is like craving that the heroine of Coca-Cola

<timemark seconds="1329" />

and you saw a cold bottle of water to be so excited for that we want some some mouth pleasure and if you've ever been before like in the desert can you get to fill it really is you get in that mode where you've been truly thirsty which I've been before you know just like I was going to die but I've been close to getting some sort of a heat stroke scenario happening and and then got to stream pump the water drink the water and that's the most beautiful thing in the world have water and you get it it's what you supposed to have folks I think people are supposed to struggle I think there's there's a part of us that long for the old times when we were just some sort of primitive monkey people running away from

<timemark seconds="1389" />

animal so there's that that still in our DNA possibly come up with his I'm going to fight you guys were going to do in a cage so why is that so popular we still have that instinct that we want if we want to fight and going to struggle to survive and I have talked about this so many times that it transcends every language like Cricket is so giant in England right and then India TV what the fuck are you doing what's going on is this the real sport of of MMA is not I mean it is unquestionably it's a sport and there are rules but a transcend you know what's happening you might not understand

<timemark seconds="1449" />

when you see a guy turning red cuz the other guys behind him choking the fucking life out of them awesome to say I know you want to put this guy down and they'll fall down and that's all you need to tell him and then they'll be basically doing double leg takedowns instinctively have this guy throw the ball to three times every time you swing if mrs. So that's close to him and I know it's also feels good about like choking somebody you know something about it but even if you're not hurting him mean it just feels good is that it feels like you're supposed to do it maybe just you and I

<timemark seconds="1508" />

price it and gets that scratch getting so popular because you take a random person on the street male female 10 years old twenty years old 40 years old you put them up and you say okay when you get this other person in this position right here and you get their arm around you put your arm around their neck you can kill them or you can accept the you can accept their tap you can have mercy on them that's a powerful feeling you guys can be friends and practice killing each other and not even heard each other like like I'm sure you recognize that like I feel better working out with black belts I feel safer for sure training with guys Village super high level than I do with even guys that are like an athletic white belted might spaz out and accidentally head all the time to people saying hey I am I too old to start your own 52 years old on 49 years old and what I tell him is you're not through but you need to be smarter

<timemark seconds="1568" />

and one of the smartest decision can you make his choosing your training partners and you don't want to train if you're a 52 year old guy that's never trained before and you're a white belt you can get on the mat the person you don't want to train with is the other white belt that's 22 years old that's on steroids that's going to go psycho and he's going to Egypt this is not controlled by the black belt the percentage chance of you being hurt by a black belt if you're a white belt it's just no time is nearly zero on nearly 00 martial arts class in the instructor asked me to come in and demonstrate one particular type of move the other day and so I start I demonstrated and we were talking about like some different positions that are important for kids to recognize like how to make sure you don't get like kids were giving up their back when they were trying to pass guard they're trying to pass Garden they were pushing down and I might never want to turn you

<timemark seconds="1628" />

and she's a little brain spinning man and you see them practicing on each other and they're laughing and the girls you know so that you watching these like eight year old girls having the best time like choking each other and everything is going through these motions and to me I mean I think it's fucking awesome and these kids do it all the time no one's getting hurt there. They're having a great time with each other and it's just this Primal release like let's get all that shit out of there and then you can be civil even if there's no Jiu-Jitsu instruction involved around and you take two kids and you put them in the yard eventually figure to start wrestling with each other but it's just natural like they getting their hips La Push each other than trying to figure it out neither one of them knew what to do and I kind of wanted to go up and Sharko Channel brother just playing in the grass

<timemark seconds="1688" />

it's it's fascinating to see just a natural human instincts and that's the other thing I've noticed in teaching kids the kids are the parents of think while you know my son he's Beauty he's kind of a kind of smart kid I don't know if he's going to like this but the opposite is actually true very often where the kid that cerebal he'll recognize as soon as you've shown three things like you said he's going to wait a second and I'll be able to be to get into it even more than didn't you know some kid that's just kind of a natural Bruiser it is and and you're you're you're not being facetious when you use the word assassin nerds because you know this is you if you go back before you need to get there before I do Jiu Jitsu before I need you to

<timemark seconds="1748" />

and you'll 200 lb man okay fight and hit one time in the side of the head and then he's in on my back and put me to sleep that's the reality assassin's, that you strong complex game of kinetic Chessa mean it's more complex in chest because you know you got these different pieces and their restricted in their movement Jiu-Jitsu is not restricted and its transition has so many different possibilities and so many different setups are so many different times you get lead one way and then just to get you to defend so they can establish that was in third position and that part of it is is what I think really for me transferred from Jiu Jitsu to not only to the battlefield what's a life as well because

<timemark seconds="1808" />

the big things you did you from my perspective is that you don't go strength against strength right if I don't think I'm trying to choke you I don't try and choke you over the I don't just grab your neck know I work on your arm and your guard and then I eventually while you're thinking about something else boombatz when I grab your neck or that's when I grabbed your arm and that's what I think on the battlefield know you can't you just don't attack hardened positions of the enemy and in life you know if you're trying to be a leader you're trying to step up and Lead somebody you don't just come down and that's not as effective as maneuvering and adjusting your position and getting in a better position and then getting that person to give you what you want instead of trying to take it from that's so important lesson 4 Parenthood you know what you just do it cuz I told you to do it. Like fuck you not only to Kids R Kids

<timemark seconds="1868" />

people need to understand why they're doing what they're doing and you know if I want you to go take down some building and capture some bad guy I don't go hey hey Joe I want you to take down the building once you're back I want you to take in his methodology I want you use for the clearance because when I send you to go do that mission it's not your mission it's my mission I came up with a plan you didn't so you might be there was a better way to do it or you might have an idea of how to get it done and now when you go out there and you meet some kind of resistance whether it's an obstacle you didn't expect or whether it's some scenario that you didn't foresee instead of you trying to overcome it you just play me and here we are trailing forget it we're going back we're not going to carry out the mission as if I said hey here's what I want you to do go figure out the best way to do it and now you come up with a plan and now you make up all the methodology get it done and you decide where you're going to take with you now it's your plan you own that plan and when you go out in the field and you meet a little resistance guess what you do you should come to find a way around it

<timemark seconds="1928" />

how to make it happen and that's another piece of leadership and it's the exact same thing the kids if you tell your kid good grades in school that means nothing to them but if you explain to them hey I would love for you to get your drinks and here's why it's an open opportunities for you in the future it's going to allow you to be able to outsmart people cuz you have more knowledge than them and they're going to be able to end up making more money which is actually give you more freedom in the long run instead of doing a job that you don't want to do you explain all those things to a kid is going to a lot more successful than just do what I told you get good grades Because I Said So businesses and they bring you into a sort of these leadership what would you call them leadership seminars principles that you discuss when you talk about absolutely no that's another another all this time ideas about interacting with human beings they just don't change like there's little variance

<timemark seconds="1988" />

you're doing were kids or what are you doing with adults and what they were dealing with business people with your dealing with soldiers on the battlefield the leadership principles they don't change and therefore you can try to get people to go out after until a bad guy or what you're trying to get them to build some product and sell it the principal leadership don't change to you're still trying to get a bunch of totally independent people right and it's one of the mix we have to overcome a lot cuz I don't think so in the military when she's talking robot is not true everybody the military is free thinner people there people there free-thinking people in their agendas and they're going to think of ways to do things that they think are better than yours so you have all these independent free thinkers and you got to get them on board with the same plan to you to go out next year and so it doesn't matter if you're on the battlefield in business that's what that's what you're trying to get done and Leadership principles don't change it to me as a person is it works is like how how do you get

<timemark seconds="2048" />

all these different people to follow through on a plan and who are the leaders and why do the leaders have the right ideas and who educates them a lot of people are excited about where the military is right now like Tim Kennedy reenlisted yeah and he really loves him yeah I relisted Because he believes that the military I support now I was put on this Earth to kill bad guy that's what he wants to do me and I think I agree with Tim Kennedy his money where his mouth is and in his eyes that this is me know this is the way that it should have been that you should give the military the chance to do their job that's their idea and then other people believe that they should be much more civilian oversight and they should be much more much more checks and balances before things get done this is Isabel is going on today

<timemark seconds="2108" />

just talked about what the military gets told to do and how they do it another two different things and I think that yes you are absolutely the civilians should control and to control the military by the way they do control the military under control civilians and yet once you say okay this is what we want to happen you need to let the military professional figure out how they're going to go and make it happen that's where it gets tricky right because if you are in that like one of things that was explained to me by a friend is Navy SEAL you saying that when something needs to get done and you have all these people that are telling you how you can do it how you can't do it if people that are not in expansion combat and don't understand what what could or could not go sideways like to put more problems in place or to put more checks and balances in place you're actually going to put these people in more danger that is true

<timemark seconds="2168" />

you should like I said if you let the civilians decide what it is that needs to be accomplished and in the military leaders decide how they're going to go ahead and make that that happen and I mean it goes back to it goes back to Vietnam you know there was too much civilian oversight of what was happening in Vietnam and the military leaders were they didn't really have the wherewithal didn't have the free reign to go out and try and make things happen the way they want to do and it ended up in a big Quagmire seems like to me from an outsider to be one of the most fucked-up Wars ever make sense that it was happening and then now we know that the Gulf of Gulf of Tonkin was very likely a false flag and that there was some sort of motivation to get there in the first place and then you're dealing with guerrilla warfare for the first time ever US History like they didn't exactly know how to handle this no we didn't and we didn't adapt very well to what was happening on the ground which is always going to be problematic if you have close-minded people

<timemark seconds="2228" />

in the military if people are closed mind that there you're not going to be able to move forward against when it when the battlefield changes in a conventional force that we went up there to fight against saddam's big army but once that fell apart then what happened and now all the sudden we were facing gorilla skin and an Insurgency and it took us several years to change our strategy from Wheaton to know what to do don't want to hear what we need to do so it took us some time to adjust our strategy and Iraq and luckily we had some good leaders that Dad went ahead and made those changes isn't it also that when you're in war and the strategy and not stretch but the motivations very clear like if you fight against Hitler's Army in World War II where is in Vietnam it's like why are we here

<timemark seconds="2288" />

what's going on what's Happening extremely extremely challenging that is why you know I've talked about this before America or any nation is going to go to war you have to decide that this is the most important thing in the world you have to end of wheels that I talked about that you have to have to text you this war you got to have you got to have the will to kill people in and again I say this all the time no one wants to hear it cuz it's ugly and horrible but when you say going to kill people in war you're not just going to be able to pick week you'll just the bad guys civilians are going to die it is a nightmare kids women it's horrible it's awful and if you think I'm going to go to war we're just gonna kill the bad guys it's not going to happen Wars 2 complex it it's just not going to I'm not going to get hit

<timemark seconds="2348" />

in war so you have to have the will to kill people course it's easy to have the will to kill the bad guys but then you have to accept the fact that some innocent people are going to die and that is going to be awful and then on the other side of the coin is of course if you're going to send people or people Americans are going to die and there's nothing you can do about it you have to accept that fact and you know that's why Vietnam was just the ultimate tragedy written in many respects because we were killing a lot of civilians we were losing a lot of Americans but we weren't progressing the way we needed to There's a Nightmare agree with you 1% what do you think about transparency like when the Bush Administration wouldn't let them take photographs of coffins and then send them home like a lot of people really upset because there's a lot of people that felt like look American should know that there's a cost to this and they should know that there's consequences to these actions and they were saying that these consequences and knowing about these consequences good lesson morale could lessen support.

<timemark seconds="2408" />

home when they really really need to know this so that what they need to know is we're on the right track and we're doing well that's a tough one and whether it's the right decision to keep the Americans in their beautiful bubble that they live in and let them know that this war is happening but you don't have to see the the brave Americans coming home it better to sacrifice their lives and interesting ly if you remember I think it was at or what the Battle of Darwin World War II and for the first time but so we work we needed money to run World War II a lot of money war bonds and all that and we were kind of falling behind and we needed some money and one of the first times that they released a lot of pictures of American Dead Americans was I think it was the Battle of Tarawa and there was all these Americans washing up on the beach in the Marines at a drowned and got shot and it was awful but they did it for reasons they did it to show like hey this is real this is happening we need to put Pitch in we need money we need to save

<timemark seconds="2466" />

save me. Save your car's we all need to get in for the big win right and that's the opposite of what we're talking about when they're saying hey you're not allowed to take pictures of the Americans are being killed and they don't I think there should be some level of transparency there when you should America should see what is happening what is the cost cuz it's really easy for Americans to to sit there and allow these young kids to go overseas and fight and die or be wounded Gravely wounded and just to shut those chicken you just ignore him cuz I don't care cuz I'm over here in the mall know maybe we should maybe we should not only you know maybe we should not only show pictures of the coffins that are coming back but maybe we should explore and show the lives at those men sacrificed and who they were and what they did and what their families are alike and wife and kids and mom and dad that they left behind that they gave up and why did they give it up because they believed in Freedom and so now we just going to stay home that's not happening now it's happening and you need to you need to know it it is

<timemark seconds="2526" />

strange right when you think about how little access to information people really had back in World War II they were counting on the news and we're counting on newspapers and now today we have massive massive access-to-information instantaneously but yet you get less of it when it comes to that yeah and and in some ways to get more of it I mean obviously when there's an incident that happened overseas you can find out about it on Twitter as fast as you can find out about it through you know waiting for real news source to come up with it but you don't get anything that's specifically distributed by the US government to let you know the consequences of war and say hey folks we need your support this is what's really going down these are American citizens this is what's happening to them over there and then the same thing could be set it for 8 sometimes civilians are going to get killed and what do we do what do we do then do we brush that under the rug and we just show The Americans getting killed or do u university show what's happening what war is war is jacked up I'm here to tell you or is not glorious

<timemark seconds="2586" />

is not fun it is a horrible event and so yeah I think you should expose it horrible as war is there's many times throughout history where war is the absolute in my mind in my opinion the right thing to do and we don't have a choice in and we need to do something when horrible things are happening and I think that's your my podcast I talked about like the like I said I talked about war and death in horrible genocide in the reasons why I think it's it's gotten the attraction is because I'm talking about things that don't know otherwise being ignored and I think people do want to know I think people do want to understand War II deeper level so that way when they hear a politician up there saying hey we should go to war they can at least say them so I know what I know what he's talking about about hey we're going to wave the flag going to send some soldiers over there that's not what

<timemark seconds="2646" />

mauritz and let's not ever forget that that's not what war is war is a man and another man on a battlefield surrounded by people civilians and they're trying to kill each other and it's a bloodbath and week we shouldn't forget that and is it necessary sometimes it absolutely is it absolutely is necessary sometimes but we better way or our minds have a movie before we make that decision to go next to you about the evolution of human beings you think about how much safer is today versus how it was thousands of years ago do you ever foresee a time where won't exist

<timemark seconds="2684" />

I don't know either people joke with me a lot about the robot wars and robots being able to accomplish Wars I actually believe that thing will come by I mean we've got drones right now that that are very capable pretty soon we'll have land Warfare robots that will be able to go in and clear buildings and and make things happen and then will the enemy then have robots that will fight our robots at some point yeah and then at some point will that elevate to a point where we're not dealing with physical robots anymore but just a software behind the robots and now it's just a big sort of the cyber warfare that that is that's inconceivable to me now Joe

<timemark seconds="2723" />

don't mistake me for some kind of like a Sam Harris intellectual over here Buddha mentary thought process could not Elevate to a point where we have robots fighting robots and then eventually Escalade to point where it's some kind of cyber warfare with it's not physical but it's just information based that does make sense to me that that could happen especially you see those Boston Dynamic robots have you seen that awesome app Hills they can run like 60 minutes it's really and what they're doing now is just I mean who knows where they're going to be 10 years from now they're going to be solar powered to live out there with no food it'll be awesome and then and then then where we go out to fight people for a while probably people that don't think I don't people don't have good and that's not good

<timemark seconds="2783" />

how about robots right and we'll see where it goes from there if you got if let's say America has these robots that can just come in with ruthless precision and take out bad guys and you know you're going to be at their Mercy

<timemark seconds="2802" />

that was a fucking science fiction movie right like China develops robots it take over New York City moving around yeah and what's interesting I've seen some other ones like you don't need them that they put all this effort into making it actually walk instead of have you know wheels or tracks or whatever the wheels or tracks with little Posite they want us to look like for a person for some reason a human shape is not necessarily the most effective you know structure for fighting talk us into standing up straight I can pick up 10 lb the big deal I'm better than that fuck this robot someday though it's it's just we like things that look like us for for whatever reason you know we like the idea that this thing is going to look like ice but yeah I agree with you it doesn't need to

<timemark seconds="2862" />

the real Combat robots probably won't look like they won't be bipedal they won't be worth with the machine will have many legs like what was I when there's like a cheetah there's some crazy ones like a cheetah in it runs at some fucking ridiculous speed and it's terrifying they had one that was on a treadmill is this the cheetah one

<timemark seconds="2889" />

again it's obviously not the best Galloping is not the best structure because you have to make this thing up and run whereas with the wheels on it or Treads or something like a tank of mini tank yeah but I wonder if you like forgetting of the logs and stuff like that if there's any sort of benefit they also have those ones that leap up in the air and they can go over there go over the top of walls and shit that's what you need is some kind of a legs that can pop out if they need to maybe we should just designed this thing and take over small wheeled bags and come back wheels

<timemark seconds="2932" />

Google Skynet that's what we should be careful of Google is powerful God damn stuff is pretty crazy so I don't know about the information so I can't tell you just look it up cuz we're getting scared this is like the Google Siri this is for the new pixel phone pronouncements on top of that to what supposed to be significant and legs is burnt there you go through does this it goes down the stairs and then it gets two Maids it gets to this wall like a hurdle and fucking bounces over this hurdle like it's nothing there snow doesn't matter grass.

<timemark seconds="2992" />

no matter what the problem is one of those wheels made out of you shoot one of those Wheels I think fuckly it bounces right over that no problem talks its legs it looks terrifying and put it covered in like some creepy fucking fake skin like an alien and then you put sensors on it and thermal sensors at night vision sensors and you wouldn't be able to get away from it I mean just think about that technology and then add that Tesla technology for self-driving cars and knows where all the cars are and everything

<timemark seconds="3026" />

swear just wear a just a few years away from something very very bizarre again I kind of look forward to it the robots I'll go down to blaze of glory yeah that's like it's an out-and-out battery and understand the world around you wide enough that I Google The Google Lens thing that used to be existing and they took it away it's kind of built what was a Google Translates the world that translates languages and everyone will have it that has a new pixel and what does it do its doing a bunch as far as I know right now it's a bunch of AI information so it's looking at barcodes and QR codes all over the place and it's you don't even have to have a really good version of it you can do it from far away and I can read it

<timemark seconds="3086" />

they can be really low pixelated resolution okay so what what is bark why why do you need to read barcodes show me to tell me a link on Amazon you can one click it just like that so that's one good thing that it does for the barcodes but compare prices and stores it saying automatically weather choose an Amazon and no block that might be so basically we're moving into the ultimate age of consumerism

<timemark seconds="3134" />

I mean I think you have to hold it up to see it so it's right here it says you can even at a flower in it and it will identify the species below you can point you pull up a Bandz music or videos by pouring the lens at a concert poster wow so like right now there's something that popped up Annapolis phone recently that people don't really know cuz it's hard to see I can fight type in your name Joe gets underlined and if you click that a whole bunch of information pops up and needs to like all of your things on Apple music at least your webpage a Siri assistant thing but it's hasn't been advertised and it's not really expensive work for every person's name like it might not work for Jocko willink but it will work for Joe Rogan and I might in the future if they updated or I don't know who needs to update but that's kind of it's cool to this is an updated version of that belief

<timemark seconds="3181" />

and just to bring this conversation back to where we were the further we go in this direction of Technology being in every part of our Lives the further away we get from having to struggle with things in the bigger hole there's going to be invisible that you sense and I sense which is if you're not struggling for not working you for not fighting for something that's just going to go further and further into the past and forgive them for the town of people going to that pool to fill up somehow requirements it is it stress requirements and if you always did want to talk about is like a battery and like almost like the not a conventional better the way we think of as but almost like a storage vessel for energy and then if you don't do anything with energy at sort of booze is over the side and fucking battery acid cross the outside of it like he gets all fucked up but if you just keep pumping out energy keep doing something it maintain some sort of homeostasis and maintain some

<timemark seconds="3241" />

the balance point it and maintain some sort of operational happiness like what were the bodies not fighting against itself because I think that a lot of people's bodies just fighting against them in a lot of likes the way the decisions are making it's a big a big part of it is just not taking care of their meat vehicle so confusing messages from The Flash we see that every day when you walk around America and you saw that you wonder how much longer they're going to be able to survive and what happens if they if there's a fire they have to run. They're not going to make it around the corner to go to Disneyland every Buddy's on a scooter it's weird and it's so weird and I have a friend who works at Disneyland he was telling me like that you started working there 10 years ago it was rare to see someone on a scooter and now they're all on scooters and then on scooters do they got a broken leg there are there old there on scooters cuz they've eaten themselves into this unmanageable shape

<timemark seconds="3301" />

even five years ago if you wanted to eat yourself in a miserable shape you had to walk to the grocery store to do that which was at least some form of movement and now you just one click on Amazon and you got the Cheetos in Ultra large size showing up at your front door in 2 hours and they going to come in a drone soon yeah and by the way you can just look like Cheetos and then it will feel put you up the other things that you will probably want to you want Cheetos you but I want to liters of coke and if I want some marshmallows to go with that and there you go 2 hours a day are you just kill yourself what the fuck man when is this going to end up going to be able to figure out a way to compensate for all the the shit that like it was just some sort of a pill that figures that or even crispr I was I was listening to His Radio Lab podcast with her updating crispr a new tool that they have that they're using to modify jeans and they've only figured it out over the last

<timemark seconds="3361" />

years and apparently they already started doing work on nonviable fetus is in China with this that's what they say who knows what they want by time they say that my thought is a guy telling you is probably some fucking fake person by then you know by the time it actually gets to the news who knows what kind of crazy advancements they're making you know behind the Iron Curtain or is there any more well there's China in China. For sure they're doing some dark shed with people in this goddamn technology but they think that they're not only going to be able to use this Gene editing tool but they're going to be able to plant this Gene editing tool into our genetics so that you are on Jean start doing the work of crispr for you so things like there they think that's going to take the place of antibiotics they think it's going to be able to edit out things like Alzheimer's like whatever the gene is for Alzheimer's of the edit that out so all timers will no longer exist means it's going to be really really strange because we're going to have to make decision

<timemark seconds="3421" />

I think this stuff is going to come quickly wants it like once we turn the corner watching you come fast that happened in there to talk to people that have one in two heads and jugs to be all jacked up and they're going to do those people wish I was crispr Gene editing to I don't know the actual mechanism behind it I don't understand that I've only like listen to people talk about it red things on it and then how far away is immortality is what you can eliminate all these different diseases if you could just clone your body and then you let your body go to be 20 years old then you just take your brain out put it inside that new body and you're good to go besides it's going to be even creepier than that the clock cuz I think that when you think about like cellular aging with Will what is it

<timemark seconds="3481" />

do your body's not reproduce every cell in your body except for your neurons reproduces like somewhere between every three to seven years or something like that right your neurons are the only things you keep for that for the whole life and so what they're thinking is that like as time goes on your in your cells reproduce shittier and shittier you're telling me your SRI Monica doesn't do what well they'll be able to flip that around so that as time goes on you'll be like Benjamin buttons you'll start getting younger and younger we should be really weird if they fuck it up and you start turning into a baby you know you're like some fifty-year-old then I'll sign you like dude I'm 12 again like this is not good next year going to be 11 like if they can take you and then like say if you're a 40 year old woman and they put you on a 20-year program and I like both in 20 years instead of being 60 you're going to be 20 and this is how it's going to work next year you going to be 39 next that's totally conceivable

<timemark seconds="3539" />

that's totally concealed totally 100% conceivable possible and likely then that a mortality thing isn't that far away then you up is accidents in murder and then I'll chat like that and asteroids is life become more precious than because now you're thinking I don't want to live for thousands of years if I don't screw this up more likely you're going to see a lot more parkour and those assholes are doing backflips off the Grand Canyon like that kind of more people that are like wanting to feel those Russian dudes though but he stopped a fucking buildings in Dubai and shit like you posted one of those the other day and he said something like you know I don't know how you wrote it but you said something like that

<timemark seconds="3599" />

my sentiments exactly that is jacked up but you see them on the very top of the Golden Gate Bridge doing some silly shit hanging off the edge like I did some dumb stuff when I was going to get some rock climbing without ropes not any Alex Honnold stuff but I would definitely get injured if I fell that was just being young and stupid never one time we were I was on a ship out in the middle of the Navy ship out in the middle of the ocean somewhere I was going to see you and me and one of my buddies we were doing pull-ups off the side of the ship at night on a little cable we're doing anyways cuz we were just young and stupid wow want to feel the juice is pre-war you know there's no war going on how do we prove to our buddies that we are brave

<timemark seconds="3659" />

and badass you do stupid stuff dumb stuff that's right and knowing that you can't let go it's just you know but what do you do when your whatever 23 years old is something that is like particularly in the human brain there's something that resonates about hanging from something by your hands like that's one of the scariest ones like Kingston is on his gigantic Crane and he's hanging on to the crane hang in there and he's fucking hundreds of feet up and if he falls he's just splattery just the water balloon but there's something about for some reason like bouncing scary but hanging is really scary I'm the opposite balance is scarier than hanging I'd rather hang I feel pretty pretty good hanging on so I don't you understand

<timemark seconds="3719" />

cuz I think if you don't trip and fall that's it what's the life expectancy of Kingston not so good I mean oh is that right I'm like a look at these fucking assholes, oh my God skateboard and he is on a mean like what I mean how many of these guys that's what's weird about it I saw video one guy frapping in I didn't make it of course walking around my area cheap price this kid is out

<timemark seconds="3778" />

what is that were so did you talk to about how he how he built into this did he start 20 feet and then he went to 30 feet and me to get more confident I don't think they're just just finished working at Jean smart guy he's a weird guy because you made them you're expecting like I'm going to talk to this math doubt psychopath who just just wants to just get it juice Rush all day long now he's super calm and relaxed and normal weird doesn't make any sense for him he just likes that people are weird can edged into a riot

<timemark seconds="3838" />

which is completely even even somebody completely insane to even think about that or you're going backwards like you're at a reverse 215 degrees the wrong way like any climbs up at to go above it and he's got no ropes and he just hang out with hands like what the fuck dude he was telling us a story about one time where is halfway up the mountain to realize you forgot his powder soda and some other people that were up there that were on the ropes he said hey can I borrow your yeah and I heard him talk about it that he for him it's not a big deal because he knows how strong is he knows what his limitations are so it doesn't for it it's like

<timemark seconds="3887" />

he's comfortable with someone walking on a balance beam that does it all the time that could be comfortable with it and he's climbin stuff we had this one thing that we did where we poop at people hang from a pole that was suspended over this water and it was shocking how the least the little amount of time the small amount of time that men in particular could hang from a pole like they were like I'm in one of these guys were dropped into the water and I was like what the fuck are you women want real women want it because they have their to have lighter bodies so even though their hands might be weaker like in one guy was fucking Jack goes like this football player looking dude and he didn't make it a minute and 15 in plopping into water was like this is crazy I had I had a guy in my muscle training class that was a big giant monster guy and he couldn't complete the obstacle course

<timemark seconds="3947" />

too much too much mass behind you that you're asking small limbs or small digits to control and then also too much of your part is got a pump too much blood do that tissue there's like a point of diminishing returns when it comes to size you know that that's one of things that you saw when you see Cain Velasquez fight guys Camp Alaska's is always been in that sweet spot of about 240 240 to me is about as big as you want to get cuz the guys over to 40 in the first few minutes but you take them into that fourth and fifth minute of the first in the SEC around to getting their asses kicked and became Velasquez storm was that one of the more fascinating things to watch in all my years of the UFC because he was a heavyweight that had the cardio of a lightweight but again 240 lb

<timemark seconds="4007" />

launch real heavyweight and you don't have that kind of sustained energy is a talent just like some guys are super flexible and some guys that are super strong explosive and some guys just have that big to have that range and it wouldn't to medium well know that I'm a marathoner and then vomit Olympic weightlifter but I can go for a long time that's interesting about that but it makes sense and that's what I like you said yeah that's beast mode right there is a lot going on with Kane I think one things going on is genetics incredible genetics and they they like Bob cook with tell me that cane would be out for months I get an injury and come back

<timemark seconds="4067" />

at work everybody I could just have insane cardio so maybe it's also that his base was so rock solid that his out of shape for 3 months is everybody else's you know Peak condition and was one of the reasons why I was able to overwhelm so many people but also like when you see Kain execute things he's never straining like Kane everything is perfect technique there's no like forcing anything there's no like crazy looks in his face and everything is clean and crisp and it's all like a very efficient efficient the music machine and obviously that comes from training hard and is that training hard to hard as you can change it or is that why is all dinged up the DSM-5 code of injuries well there's also like the mind like his mind is so strong that he's able to overcome the feeling of pain but sometimes like Elite athletes especially Fighters they can't distinguish between what is just like dings like everybody gets dinged up but something that's a significant injury like

<timemark seconds="4127" />

hey you've got a compromising the structure of your body if you keep pushing it you going to blow this knee out you going to fuck this disk up you're going to need surgery and it came out of gang surgeries now shoulder knees back and now we know he's is been out for quite a while with this most recent back issues so it sucks because in my opinion it's like him and fade or you know those are the two greatest heavyweights of all time interestingly same similar body style to 3240 well marbled had like the ultimate dad bods to play rugby Videos HD full address in tons of it you know but it's also like their methodology just different I mean he was like very very old school with his methods like he was doing kettlebells

<timemark seconds="4186" />

for CrossFit or pressure came to America I mean there was an old school pictures he doing strength and conditioning as his body got older and focused more on Ancient picture of him standing there shirtless around a bunch of kettlebell kettlebell I remember that picture in my mind was that he was really good rappers really good Striker put key to waking mix them together now you would see him just like the hit somebody in the face and then Judo throw them in an armlock Comercio, it was all just so smooth I don't think anyone knew what to defend because if a defendant one thing they were they defended a grappling moves are getting punched in the face they do depend upon through didn't take it down man and you know he was something special for quite a

<timemark seconds="4246" />

long time to I don't I don't think anybody can keep going longer than life just like a time that you can compete at the highest level some folks think it's about eight nine years till I can eat after eight nine years the highest level like nobody's body holds up he just all falls apart good about say door in his style and everything let's face it what was the best about fade or attitude when he would just come in there with no emotion States raises hand Dead face you know they'd introduce him he just raised his hand to keep destroy someone and you have the same trashmaster just had total absence of emotion that was to me that's what I always thought yes that's why it's a door is right up there at the top of my list on a bunch of fucking iron cannon balls with handles on them and those aren't some little kettlebells either alone must have sold millions of dollars and kettlebells

<timemark seconds="4306" />

how to get some mad but he also was very smart and that's his brother actually he was very smart with his training where you know he spent some time in Holland is it in his brother brother now getting the picture of Alexander know for sure there different kind of white people they totally different they just did so much different well it's the hard upbringing but diamonds diamonds made out of pressure and the other guy that comes to mind when we're thinking about full School Fighters that really it wasn't just his skill-set which is on the way but soccer Abba cuz the way so I can Rob at his craziness and just go in there and just to have that incredibly playful attitude also chain-smoked and drink through the entire Camp chain smoke and drink

<timemark seconds="4366" />

Ticketmaster

<timemark seconds="4372" />

attitude of not giving a fuck is like that's what worked so well for him inside the inside the rent yeah well I know we should just all the time with Fighters when she would anybody that dude is going to live out on the friends like that they're going to have some sort of offset there's there's another there's for every action has an equal and opposite reaction rates are you get guy that's 11th at 4 on the edge like the soccer Rob was that that just doesn't stop when he gets out of the cage right is going and going to get after it more she had some horrible losses though she got he got used in an exploited worse than anyone else right I mean worse than any other fighter no one has been exploited and put into those horrible fights where he just wasn't out and he was just out Matthews old he wasn't right and they were just put them in there and just let him get destroyed his knees were mangled so he would run his knees up like a mummy horrible and you knew that that was a real

<timemark seconds="4432" />

like he could move so good at these were all wrapped up and fucked up and then they put them in there with Wanderlei and vandelay knocked him out what three times brutal brutal Kos I think at least twice or three times but then Melvin man of the Soccer kicking them cuz you could soccer kick and cry and stomp

<timemark seconds="4453" />

yeah he had some really tough fights he's apparently doing a grappling superfight now I think he's grabbing he grappled Enzo and metamoris that's right I was thinking of something of shinya Aoki is going to Grapple with Garry tonon oh that oh yeah yeah they're going to have a straight-up grab them yeah, most likely between guys were good in MMA and guys were good at like straight-up grandpa in the training vids of Gary and he's doing rope climbs and he's just that's all he does look good also coached by John danaher and he's part of henzo Gracie crew in Ark City and that danaher death squad man talked about it a real like wizard of Jiu Jitsu Donner understand his Instagram

next matches what went well what went wrong what's required of athletes and and how to Excel and the difference between an athlete in competition versus a difference in training as well as with most recent things about putting yourself in bad positions and working on your weaknesses as opposed to just continuing to push your strengths that that's a big one of the fighters that are good in training but are not committed in their cage and there's other fighter how to get beat up in training but I'm going to get in the cage that they were just turned it on the Elevate themselves and then some guys that are crushing everyone during training they get in the cage in UFC fight night or whatever and they just they just can't I can't get it done that night, yeah there's so many factors right and I think some of them are also the ability to overcome adversity and with really talented guys they didn't really have to overcome that much adversity because they were good really quick

<timemark seconds="4573" />

like guys who had massive physical advantages and then for some reason you know once they faced other people that also have physical advantages but we're tougher they would just go. Just fall apart did Wilt yeah it's so common yeah you got to get that in in and we got some guys at the doctor this guy at the gym right now who's just he's just a he's a mutant he's a mutant like he's so strong he shot on me the other day and so he's on all fours and he's at he fights at 185 I'm on all fours and he picks me up with one hand with one hand picks me up and slams me get the cross-eyed and I said bro did you just like shot put me right there and he walked on a 200 205 you know typical picture of one hand but not with his back but like with his arm

<timemark seconds="4628" />

you're going to see him Taylor-Johnson watch out for him what is his background he wrestled he recipes that are great wrestlers and their and they're okay to get to but they can't quite make that transition in the Striking is okay but they can't quite make that transition that for whatever reason whatever gift he's got he so the other day we were training and he's been training this was in training for like six months right and he Dives for a camera on me and you don't have to move and get out and you know we keep trying and whenever we get done this man you know I just can't walk anything up on uh campus I can't get any finishes on you and I was like bro

<timemark seconds="4670" />

you've been trading for 6 months those guys have been training her for 10 years and have never even attempted a submission on me and you're trying to submit me with my own move the camera I'm like bro don't worry about it it's going to come so yeah it's but my point is with him is he's an incredible athlete and he's got that work ethic to and so and he's competed a high-level wrestling and Judo but none the less you savage the ability to compete it's it's an interesting ability like it's some people just don't have it or they said they don't have it they lacked the mental skills to overcome pressure-filled obstacles and you're right and there's some people that step up when that you think you can turn yourself to the stress it's just the mind so like like the idea that these pitfalls in the minor insurmountable I think that's ridiculous that seems to be more surmountable or more

<timemark seconds="4730" />

more more possible than physical problems cuz like physical problems like if you're a hundred 40 lb in a guy's 240 lb talented and pulley driven boy you're fucked kind of talk to you well that being said it is similar to what we talked about earlier which is when you have somebody that's called their own mind they can't get the prospective to step out dude just calm down right it's all kinds of Fighters they're going through that never came out of it well there's a really important quote if you win you win if you lose you learn and so you always win and if you think about it that way every time you know I remember pretty much every time I've ever been to Millie ated on the mat every time I've ever been a really manhandled and tap I remember them very well and I also remember like everytime I rolled it like a real high level

<timemark seconds="4790" />

don't got my ass handed to me my training jumped up a notch cuz like you know it's Xpression the rub like you train someone is way better yet all you realize like whatever I thought was like a high-frequency there's people that are operating like several hundred RPMs faster than that and I just hadn't counted them you know and I think that to be around that is so important if you eat if a train with a guy that likes trains in a small town and all the people in the towns like maybe like purple bell to do a certain RPM that they all operate in and if you come in and you used that fucking San Diego assassin RPM and they like what the fuck is this guy doing like they're just not used to it they have it but if you come from a place like that and you try to train and hens or something like that like you didn't want you jumping into a fucking pit of killers like and that's what you know that old expression iron sharpens iron could not be more true when it comes to jiu-jitsu

<timemark seconds="4850" />

can you get those people out you know I'm not mind about do I get my ass kicked by a guy that's been training for 6 months no I hate it I hate it Taylor well guess what I call him out every time you know and I talk smack to him I don't talk about this Mac guy talk smack to him I'm like hey whatsup young buck you want to come get some of this to every day cuz I want to change it because he's that strong and of course I'm sure it doesn't make any sense I got my bra with some research before my okay whatever you are just there's if there's people and then like this like a chimp people your head chimp person like when your body is used to form the time you're in early kid throwing bodies around like your tendon strength in your your ability to manipulate bodies is a very different kind of strength I mean it might not translate to a 40-yard dash

<timemark seconds="4910" />

horse prints or do you know lifting weights but there's the physical ability to move bodies is very unusual and you always have to be along the way that don't do well in MMA strong but I think that's a mental thing I think they have like some limited factor in their brain where they don't they just can't quite open in mind to Jiu-Jitsu I can't quite open your mind to strike and they can't get out of that wrestler mentality of you notice I have to go as far as I can right now cuz you will run out of box you can come home with headaches every night going to get very discouraged it's a matter of who your training with to like as far as your trainer or like who's who's coaching you and what methodology they using and what what mine said they're trying to impart on you as far as ice Kill Devil

<timemark seconds="4970" />

cuz there's so many people out there that just don't have like a real clear philosophy like they don't have a goal like in terms of like I want to work on footwork in avoiding certain shots and being able to move in better you know instead they're just trying to win every round or they're trying to do you know push hard and then do you not get to the next level which in my mind we get past the athleticism we get past them mental overcoming of challenges and then in my opinion you get to the next level which is creativity that's when you get to McGregor Bryant Jonny Bones Jones they're doing things that they're kind of making up their making love live as they go and I think that to me is is know we kind of so I think we would be Japan back in the day he was creative I think they'd or did it where he was he was doing creative things but I think to me that's that's where you go that one level higher is when you add the creative element to a guy that

<timemark seconds="5030" />

Take A and B and make F out those things somehow there's something about Jones or fate or a prime time BJ Penn it elevates you if you watch someone do something special like that and you've just walk out of there you feel like I know I can run faster than I could before I saw that fight I know I could lift more weight I know I could do something better just people watching this is a huge thing that will that one of the reasons why people enjoy watching all kinds of sports but in particular Combat Sports when people do something amazing and makes you feel like amazing things are possible I actually I have limitations on that too because personally watch somebody if some random fighter or whenever I say

<timemark seconds="5090" />

you know what I could not do what that guy can do it just makes me tumbling I think it's humbling I was wanting you know Jack Black right there sure I was watching Jack Black the other day and you know I look at Jack Black and look at some I look at some right I look at Brad Pitt what's Brad Pitt doing I could do what he's doing is talking on the movie Scream whenever I don't underestimate him this right but that's one thing I didn't know I could do that but I was I was watching Jack Black and Jack Black was singing and I was like I can't do it. But don't write their respect and props to check the pipes the pipes look the same time I look at you know that Jonny Bones Jones and I go I wouldn't have done what he just did I look at McGregor angle you know what she's got that you got some will spark that I don't have a flair McGregor has its half of what he does mean

<timemark seconds="5150" />

ridiculous power but there's also this flare about him when he fucking walks in there playing in his arms and they still the fucking audaciousness of his you know he's just so ridiculous and it was really impressed me when he came back and be very close by. Actually I don't have to watch it again I usually don't watch fights more than once but I know it was very very close I thought so too even just as close as it was I was impressed that I was I think one of most impressive sheets I'm seeing as far as that mental game were talking about to come back and say know what I'm going to do it this time and he was on some serious

<timemark seconds="5210" />

biotics and it's one of the reasons why he was so drained like people to call you cast out like if you've never taken antibiotics before you don't know how fucking horrible it is on your gas tank it's when it's a weirdest thing ever so you can be in great shape you get on a run of antibiotics in your body is just you got to the fucking thimble gas tank there's nothing left but no energy for whatever reason you just can't push yourself through stuff and I think that played a factor in that fight here's the thing about McGregor you never had a fucking peep about it if it wasn't for me talking about it most people wouldn't even know he's a bad motherfuker and I don't know I don't mean they said he signed the Floyd Mayweather deal when did that happen did you happen yesterday note Mayweather has not signed the negotiating the flea medicine

<timemark seconds="5258" />

my people suck I mean maybe he's going to go full Bernard Hopkins just fucking clench and hit him in the clinch and tie him up and drop him off and it maybe that's the plan lean on his neck you know just put fight dirty levitate qualified don't like stand the middle of the ring and try to fucking shuck and jive with them but it's a good fight in terms of like to see what the fuss say yeah how much money is that going to make he's going to make a fuck ton of money he's going to make sure that you keep estimated I don't know if it's true between 75 and a hundred million dollars somewhere in that range too maybe more probably more but I think that it's going to be interested personal Floyds 40 almost 41 Floyds maybe the best defensive boxers ever walked the face of planet mean he's right up there in my me you go back to Willie Pap a lot of the guys from the old days and for sure lomachenko today but in terms of like

<timemark seconds="5318" />

overall performance against Elite Fighters over the course of his career the guys only been tagged hard like five or six times ever he's a fucking freak and hard work mean he deserve it baby you looking at me throwing money around driving Bentleys but that fucking guy will get on the strip and he'll be run in miles at 3 in the morning he opens up his gym 3 in the morning just does 15 round to the back just he works hard real hard anymore that'll be an interesting one but he might not you know he might tag Floyd I mean if he can Conner is very good at closing distance and snapping off like lead shots like it's one of the things that he did with Nate and he's a southpaw if she can just snap off one or two clean shots and make it interesting it'll be fun I don't know if you can I don't I don't know what he can do is straight box it's so hard to judge

<timemark seconds="5378" />

come out without knowing without seeing and if they do do what I think they're going to do it somewhere around September I think that's the idea Jesus Christ so what you doing with you until then nothing so they've lightweight division is on hostage right now they're being held hostage something or whatever that's supposed to make the weight and didn't make the way happen there Tony Ferguson and Habib were supposed to fight a beads liver shut down yeah he's cutting too much weight these guys they get to fucking big know they get up 290 and they try to get down to 155 and he couldn't make it was he walk around at 190 that's what I heard I don't know what he really way but he's up for sure is so super high level I wanted I wanted to see that fights so bad cuz Tony Ferguson is a fucking Savage he's a straight Savage so him vs Habib like I watch that fight with him and Edson Barboza

<timemark seconds="5438" />

then the other day crazy fucking wild bloodbath until Tony caught him with the Darcy was a fucking amazing fight that's the guy I want to see fight a guy who's the only undefeated the top-level the game we just have everybody in front of how much longer until he can fight them who knows if you'll ever be able to make 155 again who knows who knows what kind of damage is done to his body and his rapid rapid horrible way Cuts I don't know man I don't I don't know his medical history is medical history or we should plan for the Michael Johnson fight apparently had a similar problem he made the weight but apparently was real touch and go yeah can do that mean you want supper cut your calories back do a lot of fucking running drop somebody wait you're going to have to end it can be done it can be done yeah you going to have to do it because of dehydration

<timemark seconds="5498" />

fucking dye someone's going to die Mission and he is such a fucking animal any Foster's one of the most important guys at in terms of like commission the guys run commission's in MMA he's like one of the most proactive when the most knowledgeable and one of the very best maybe the best he saw on the ball so he's pushed hard for these new weight classes and these new weight cutting regulations and such a fucking smart thing is awesome an Electra 225 weight class 95 weight classes 565 just go 10 every 10 is good 10 makes sense when you don't like

<timemark seconds="5552" />

70 and then you got 85 and 285 and 205 that's too many that's too many pounds I mean GSP vs how to explain it to people being in the room stood next to those guys have big big big is a normal sized guy I don't see how that fight was going to be fair you don't also Bisping is currently active GSP took years off this being is capable of fighting 55 it says the Bisping said he can make 55 wow so if he wins at 18185 he is thought about fighting either at 170 or at 1:55 like what the fuc he's a big dude straw train with him he's a big strong these what 6 to something like that

<timemark seconds="5612" />

just like the ultimate like Bulldog mindset and just refusing an elephant's the chain that I think it was a few days I think it was like 11 days notice you're such a crazy now just being pissed talkin shittt Dana White on Twitter cuz he was mad at idle shot and he hasn't heard a title shot yet he's like what the fuc to GSP do and I'll man the whole the whole weight classes in a flex there's a funny meme of this being said that he's in his knees hurt cuz they said that the UFC said they wanted to fight you over marrow because the GSP fight is off actually my knees hurt so I can wait for GSP I'm good I'm so sit back and take a little break so is it a funny meme of GSP Michael Bisping in the hospital bed that says Bisping be like I'll just sit here and wait for GSP

<timemark seconds="5672" />

Ulysses Savage terrifying but that really bums me out with them cheating if I to grab his gloves punch in the face couple times where is holding your wells glove but they don't understand is you shown slow motion like it looks like he's holding on to it for a while and it's probably just throwing shit whether or not he actually knew that he has glove consciously the gloves make a really big difference secure and chokes on top of the head like old-school Ken Shamrock Style

<timemark seconds="5732" />

people start grabbing your pubic d1854 grabbing the inside that glove tomorrow it's a lot harder to finish down people have gloves on but some people finish with it when do you could get deep in there I saw him to choke somebody out with that is like you can do that if you can grab your own it's amazing how hard it is to choke people when you have those especially those Pride loves a big padded ones even Marcelo Garcia was having a really hard time with it when he had his One loan MMA fight this dude back and couldn't finish I'm in a lot of it is because of those does ninja make a big difference there really do I don't think you should wear gloves with you I think fighting if you could kick to the face like you can send some in the face we can't knock a woman would be so helpful for all that's happening if they took off the gloves

<timemark seconds="5792" />

hit you twice before I broke my hand and now I'm going to be grappling with you and try to take you down under stand that you are very likely to break I don't think you should be able to wrap your hands either yeah I really don't know would be awesome. Let me know so I think you should have a cop on and a mouthpiece and shorts and I really think that's it I mean and people that guy you're fucking idiot at your Barbarian to need to cover the glove don't. You're less of a barbarian you make yourself you make yourself more able to hit someone and you don't really help them at all like it's harder to hit someone bare-knuckle it's it's more realistic I wish they would make that change Canton bare-knuckle that's crazy fit your knuckles are way more vulnerable like it's way harder to get that off until you wrap it up and make it like a cast you wrap it up and you get some

<timemark seconds="5852" />

ice tip wristband it was hard, it's hard just turn it up. Don't never make that change I don't say I don't think ahead and all those times and it it's not good for you catch people at stuff like it'd be way easier to secure Guillotines and chokes is just you you wouldn't have all these restrictions of having something on your hands your hands need to be able to articulate to secure a certain grips and its you see a lot more submissions I think it's better for everyone

<timemark seconds="5912" />

got to wear Me torrent tank time is on the first guys ever to wear gloves and you wore those gloves that he was wearing were like old-school Century martial arts Chuck Norris gloves like nobody even thought were those I think tank was like the innovator first fight in 1997 the first time at UFC 12 Nobody seen anything like that this guy comes in with his blazing hand Speed Build God and Jesus what do you do with this fucking kid that was that was interesting and of course we offered cuz I was the guy that time we like what is it 13 punches to the face Bubble Pop

<timemark seconds="5972" />

Bandelier was wearing shoes from 1993 to 2017 how far are fighting has changed how much we know about it now I'll always say that fighting in 1992 with theoretical and what about this martial art or whatever know what you what do you think of this and like that uses no reason to fear is not only do we know from the UFC we also have been and now a country at War whatever 15 years so all of our guys been going overseas and doing the same stuff in combat so we know what works by the I know we know what happens we know what happens if you

<timemark seconds="6032" />

it's not good hit somebody 17 times in the head with a high school wrestler yes set a Chinese Tai Chi Master try to fight an MMA fighter and it's got a bleeder a to do so and this guy's had to hide this Chinese MMA fighters had to go into hiding cuz people are offended that he battered this taichi master and made their country look bad because it's making their their traditional martial art look ineffective that's not it doesn't make sense to me but I don't know why the fuck this guy didn't understand what was going to happen with sometimes I think they actually believe

<timemark seconds="6090" />

what they're saying this is so brutal though this taichi guy what's really bizarre is Thai cheese not really a a physical fighting martial art it's supposed to be something that's more of like a meditative Yoga Yoga deal I had one of my one of my buddies blocked out the old school and he got told by a taichi guy you know you can't take me down my buddy sit up I mean. I just got a blitter rated and the only way you can never actually know what would happen if someone punches you in the face is the train that way if you just have these ideas in your head you're going to stand in front of him this touches his nose is shattered wobbly I guess first time ever been punched maybe the MMA guy should have if you had a little bit more foresight and was going to happen he should have come out in like really done the whole you no respect in the back

<timemark seconds="6150" />

and then all the stuff in the gym should help them if maybe that would have helped him for a month from a political standpoint but yeah because it seems to me that this is something that they need to say they're really do because there's too many people out there that are just buying into this foolish it will look like I said so my buddy Jeff hits got this this I think was an Aikido guy does Aikido people say chi in all that I don't know how to have Qi they probably do well pens on which a solute or whether it was Aikido or whether it was tai chi I forget but the guy says you know hey I'm a martial artist and once I settle my chi you can you can't even take me down so I won't be able to move me you can try it if you want it in my friend eggs goes okay cool tell me when your cheese all centered and the guy you know does a little thing and then settles is Jeannie says okay I'm ready

<timemark seconds="6210" />

and Jeff just did I mean it's no big deal just hit a double that that guy actually believed that that's so have a mental illness it is but I mean you know it's flat earth right it's the same time so off on this podcast I've got a couple people that are now now every time I talk about Jiu-Jitsu it all day like flat earth flat Earth supporters are mad at me for exposing they just want to believe it that's real it is a weird thing and by the way one of the main guy's who's in the flat earth makes it has a whole video about how to get to doesn't work and it's about Wing Chun isn't like one of his biggest videos on his page

<timemark seconds="6270" />

but there's like some secret power like in that in of the idea that you can just send her yourself and a college wrestler can't take you down that's one of my new things that I tell people with your magic cuz cuz it kind of is so you can do things that are almost magic elbow Escape or something from the mount and the guys like it's really hard to do cuz he keeps pulling my arm away you know when I have to fight against the other person of the human I just told him what to do and I told you what to do now you got to fight for it yeah you got to figure out how to get to the right position not magic but it is weird that people that you know they're they're looking for something to believe in again and maybe they just want a contrarian view point so that's why they pick saying that the Earth is flat why it's it's sort of the same thing that people want it short again

<timemark seconds="6330" />

this road right now I just want to walk away and it's all based on a live we're not on a globe on a flat disk spins around us like that just like to argue this may be just people that like to argue and have a country I gave me some of them for sure they could be some of them for some of them I think it's just that say to people that straight just straight-up Hustler all your soul they really believe it to join the Moonies you know his people join Scientology like a dick if they think it'll make him live forever they sue Shores, live forever knowledge will flow through you but you have to believe in San Diego

<timemark seconds="6390" />

what happens to those purple shoes in the mind is just so complicated and complex that it's grasping for Something to Believe In and some people are going to believe in anything about your ownership and it's one thing that I think that you and I are both really focused on is the way the brain works in the way the mind works in this is one of the things that I think that you reinforced with these big photos of your watch everyday is like the mind works in very peculiar ways and you can it's kind of pliable and you could force it into positive productive ways you can you can you can express yourself in these very positive productive ways and in the end in carve those grooves of productivity and of advancement well it's

<timemark seconds="6450" />

talking about we just talked about the Moonies in the Scientology where people are trying to do mind control and when I talk about mind control control your own mind you can make yourself exactly what you're just saying you can make yourself and force yourself to do things and once you get in that Groove and get in that habit it becomes part of you in that becomes who you are and why not be that person than the other person that's not doing positive things when people don't like people like to also pretend that the way they're doing it as a right way they don't want to be open to the idea that there is some other method that's may be more productive or more successful well there's the downfall I mean and that's that you know again and I think this is one of the reasons why your show is so popular and why people listen to you because you listen to other people right people listen to you cuz you listen to other people you listen to what they have to say Hugo okay that's why I haven't heard that before I'm the same way when somebody tells me

<timemark seconds="6510" />

if I don't say well I don't believe that I believe something else I go that's interesting that's interesting because it has no shit you and you're right dude this guy is wrong but you always got to like pause and think I mean again I hate to bring this back up at that could easily be was also going on with a flatter thing is they have this idea in their head and then someone says there's no photos of the earth other than composite If there really was a around Earth you be able to see a hole in your own actually there's a photo taken every 10 minutes and twenty-two thousand miles away of the four. True and they get into this thing and they get into this thing because they don't want to ever stop and pause and look at the way they're thinking versus the way other people thinking okay can I get myself in a fucking in a trap here that I get myself into an intellectual trap I'm supporting an idea that's not true and now I'm reinforcing that in my head and I'm fucking tightening up

<timemark seconds="6570" />

all my my borders and trying to figure out a way to not let new ideas in in to reinforce my old ideas you know your podcast with Jordan Peterson the other day if anyone has a podcast that's that's got to be one of the best podcasts that I've ever heard he's unbelievable podcast and he's talking about the fact that sometimes people if they if they accept those new ideas all the sudden what they've done with their life for the past 20 years gets thrown out the window and myself yeah that's that's what happened in the 90s when somebody that had been studying some traditional martial art God bless them they were doing the best they could but when all the sudden some blue belt in Jiu-Jitsu could come in there and roll them up and choke him out and it was nothing they can do about it and they either had to do one or two things say okay, start raining this new thing that I don't understand or block it out which is very hard to do what you do to me that's a good thing about anime in about USC is it was like you can deny it all you want but

<timemark seconds="6629" />

Too Faced this guy on the mat that's the only way you can end it when you do that you're going to lose where is with all these kind of intellectual arguments I say you say I say you say and if you tell me I'm telling you that every picture of the earth is whatever CGI and that's what I'm going to hold and I'm not going to let it go and how you going to prove to me otherwise and every single picture you show me I said no that CGI can you show me another picture at CGI we're never going to get anywhere I'm not arguing with you about it you never going to tell which was it's not like the it's not a good martial art for fighting it's got that by itself is going too many holes in it but it's a great martial art for throwing kicks and when I went from that to kickbox I realize how easy it was to get punched in the face and I was like Wow and so then I started really studying boxing and I was like man my my ideas of like how well I can fight or so overestimated

<timemark seconds="6689" />

I'm not nearly as if I'm a good at taekwondo I'm not good at fighting and then I started Jesus Christ shows like I'll fuck there's so much I can I'm so fucked because I got I got really good at something that kind of sucks on its own and then from there Jiu-Jitsu where I was just getting raped I was like at least it would kickboxing I could throw kicks I could move around I could try not to get my legs kicked I could try to like to be more mobile but when I was going to the Wipeout I was just getting fucking malls what happens and I had to accept it and it's literally stopped I've got to get better at this. No way I can you can't even start like a white person was ever change its before is is a 0% chance of beating a guy that's a black belt 0% if you take somebody

<timemark seconds="6749" />

doesn't really know how to fight against a boxer there there is a puncher's chance I mean there was a punch or should not probably not going to happen but it's a crazy chance but who knows could end at least the Box before has some semblance of an idea of what to do block the punches from hitting me and try and punch the other guy when you don't know you don't even understand what's Happening Here completely lost and it's certain positions like you get your back taken or something like that where you're almost a hundred percent dead yeah it's but I think that fit is parallel to that in life because if you look at life and you look at the way you're behaving in the way you're thinking in the way you choose to accept ideas and you choose to view the world if you are so rigid in your ideology that you're unwilling to accept any sort of new information in new data or any sort of contrary data or information like someone who's telling you something that you don't agree with but you you're going okay

<timemark seconds="6809" />

what's your perspective instead of just agree or disagree sir Graham and arguing and going to war with them what is this guy saying that has America where is this guy coming from or if I even if I totally disagree with what what makes him think that's what's going on in your head that you think we should take everyone's money and distributed equally across the country against people that believe that somehow or another. If you're stealing and then what we need to do is take all the money in the country and redistribute all this well so everybody gets $50,000 okay all right why do you think that you know I might I might argue with it or am I see your point or I might think that if you did do this but you still if you do this right now this is what I think if you did this right now if you took all the money from all the billionaires and all these fucking Rich tycoons all of them and took all their money and distributed equally amongst everybody in the country how long would it take if you just allowed normal capitalism to flourish after that

<timemark seconds="6869" />

how long would it take before the levels went right back to where they are how long would it take to be the way I explain that concept to my children was I said okay here's here's what communism is cuz this is what you're talking about I said let's my kids are really hard workers and they do well in school and I said for your test right that's how you get a 90 95 on your test and then what happens with Communism is there's another kid in your class who's the dumbest kid Billy okay Billy's getting up whatever and then take the points from you

<timemark seconds="6914" />

if I do that is that can inspire you to work any harder the answer is obviously no daddy no matter what is working harder than what we have been working and that's what happened to Communism you're all just level set you're all going to get the same thing and that's why it's failed everywhere stride yeah it's not the right idea for just the way the human reward system works it's not the right idea for motivation is not a ride right idea for like the only way things get done the only way you get a laptop or a big skyscraper someone as a profit from it take to get to get something out if someone has to make that happen if someone has to be driven to want to that laptop into somebody's going to want to make that and you're right for them to want it there's got to be some reward you have to be somewhere or being driven is you got to have something to show for it so we got to be really careful that the amount of wealth that you spread around if you spread it all around you're going to end up with no one

<timemark seconds="6974" />

wanting to achieve anything yeah like I heared Bernie Sanders talk and he seems like a really nice guy and he seems like he really has his mind in the right place in his heart in the right place and this idea of democratic socialism in the same talking to people make well that's definitely better than being greedy it's definitely better than being corrupted by the Banks it's definitely better than being corrupted by Wall Street and giving these bulshit phony speech is $400,000 and fucking over people for profit but does that shit but the socialism really work doesn't seem to work it doesn't seem to like work in terms of like on Bernie Sanders who has multiple homes and I hope she does I mean the guy's got multiple of you just bought a house for $800,000 in open that up to the public house of course not it's too much difference on a wake

<timemark seconds="7034" />

good good for you Bernie but don't try and you know make it like that's what like like that's okay to take everyone else's money, what a concept of income inequality is always strange cuz it's like okay but you should you make the same amount of money for a job that doesn't have the same amount of important no it's not it's just going straight up answer for you know if you got paid after 10 years of medical school the same that you got paid to drive a bus after you bust your ass and worked hard and had to study and do all the stuff to go to medical school and by the way you've built up a bunch of debt trying to go to school we we have to be careful that there are people that we need help with

<timemark seconds="7094" />

nobody's there's people with mental problems and we've got to be compassionate and take care of those people to the best of our ability but we definitely need to watch out for let's steal everything from the people that worked hard and give it to people that didn't I just doesn't seem like a good idea about human motivation basic human instincts do you stop or what cuz we could distribute all the money and wealth that we've built American distributed over the whole world concept is figuring out why there are pockets of extreme poverty and how to mitigate those pockets of poverty that have just I mean generation after generation certain neighborhoods just been extreme poverty and these people to grow up there that's what they know they're sort of almost programmed into it because they're they're seeing it around them that is the the Paradigm that they they accept and it's very self-limiting in a lot of ways we don't see anybody escaped received very few people escape it's very yet you feel like

<timemark seconds="7154" />

resistance is futile like what do you do wish I knew all the details but there was a Native American tribe and somebody I'm sure will but will tell me what it is but there's a Native American tribes in Northern California that win all the Native American tribes got designated as Native American tribes and here's what you're going to get in this is your driving these guys for whatever reason they didn't get designated as a Native American tribe they just got they got passed over no one noticed him and now all the members that try but completely dominate everything financially they own everything up there like they got a kick ass right and it's because they had to and I think a lot of times when when people just get given stuff it becomes a very very difficult for them to say you know what I'm going to go out and work hard you know am I going to bust That's a classic example of a day am I going to bust my ass at McDonald's for a fox an hour 40 hours a week or whatever 30 hours a week for 9 bucks

<timemark seconds="7214" />

I want me to work that hard doing that or am I just going to take my welfare check which is equal to or almost equal to for sitting around doing nothing but that's not a hard question answer for many many people sit around and do nothing so we got to be careful that it's hard yeah it is hard it says it is a natural inclination that people have to do the least amount to to just be as comfortable as possible as lazy as possible you know I think you are your statement that you always say Disick discipline equals Freedom that people should have that shit tattooed on their thigh you know you should look at that when you get up in the morning to put your underwear on like it's that shit is it so important because if you do have discipline and if you do go out there and get the things done that you need to get done you have freedom and you feel better and you feel relaxed cuz you're not you don't have that balloon hovering over you that balloon of you know you don't just knowing that you're not doing your best knowing that you're not out there hustling

<timemark seconds="7274" />

you just get a free check every month and you don't really have to go out there and kick ass can kind of get by boy that doesn't it's not it's not conducive to lighting that fire under your ass you need to be successful and again and I'm going to point this out for I think the second or third time today I'm no sociologist I don't I'm not some big guy that understands the mechanisms of the welfare state and all that I'm just going off of what what I think it would just simmer what you're saying look if I was just getting the check for not do anything I wouldn't feel good about it wouldn't feel good about it and so I think that there are people that go hey if I can get free money I'm going to take the free money is a concept of universal basic income that's kind of interesting though because this idea is that once we get Automation and once we get an artificial intelligence if there's going to be so many jobs that don't exist anymore that did we got to figure out what to do with all these people and the idea is if you just have your basic needs taken care of like not enough so that you

<timemark seconds="7334" />

actually Thrive but just we have food and shelter how many people would then pursue their actual love and what what it was there actually passionate about and what tests are doing they're doing on it now they're trying to find out what would the same amount of people be successful would more be successful or with less like how many people would pursue their dream if they knew that have to worry about starving to death they just got money every month they got it they knew where they were going to sleep and eat and then they could just go and do whatever the fuck they want to do or would that just squash motivation I don't know I don't know what the answer I take what I think I think it's I think it's washes motivation for some for you if you get a check every month for like twelve Grand or 12 grand for the year whatever it is like I think that's the idea see if he'd like a thousand bucks a year or thousand bucks a month to $1,000 a month maybe double that just enough that you could just get by but you know you're not bawling two questions number one of course would it would I take free money sure would I

<timemark seconds="7394" />

what about it no number to where does that money come from where does it come from that's the thing that I also explain to my kids is that you know every time you every time the government gives a dollar to somebody

<timemark seconds="7406" />

they took $2 from somebody else and it's you know it's that's the reality of It Like Bernie Madoff or some crazy Wall Street character when they just move some money around and make money like okay how much you getting out of that is that going and how does it exist Welborn he's a bad example right cuz he was stealing everyone I'll give you that money waiting companies in funding companies that are trying to grow and build and create things you know that that money it move somewhere and if your ends up investing in a company in Building Company that's what that's what that's what America is trying to build things try to make things

<timemark seconds="7459" />

yeah taking risk of wonder what is going to happen though when all these fucking robots take one is the automatic driving cars trucks because that's a huge you know you go to Vegas think about this when I'm in Vegas to go to the buffet in 10 billion pounds of food none of that food comes from Vegas so at some point all those already doing in Australia dirty have automated trucks in Australia that are driving in a shipping things around it's going to get weird engineering and all these different things we've been talking about just giving get really weird again I think the hunting down food and fighting against other tribes I think the further we get away from that the more we going to have to reach back to it and ground ourselves to it well at the very least the more you're going to have to deal with whatever

<timemark seconds="7518" />

garments your body and your mind have for difficulty I think we have requirements for struggle and difficulty because I think your body is set up to I think it biologically we have certain expectations for difficulty and when you don't uncover those oryx it encounter those expectations I think people find like a real lack of meaning and strap this lack of stress and that's where we have to reach back down to this physicality at some point if I'm just sitting there and I don't have a job anymore. I just get you know 12 five thousand bucks a month and that's enough for me to pay my food and pay my rent I'm just going to sit there and play video games I don't think that's the kind of existence I would want to live in my not even just be physical to I think it's just in overcoming an enduring and figuring things out like even writing a book I'm sure you're feeling like you just have you have a new book out the way of the warrior kid and I'm sure the

<timemark seconds="7578" />

doing that you get when you write a book and complete complete it is I fucken did it I got made that happen I didn't want to get through all those days there's a lot of times I didn't want to write but I got through it and here it is is a satisfaction of accomplishing goals and overcoming obstacles and problems and if they don't have to be physical I think this mental requirements we have as well I think when people aren't mentally challenged they just start to fade your not looking for the physical and mental challenges you're going to start seeing the warrior kid in the reason I wrote it is because first of all all the things that were talking about right now they're happening even more to kids that mean you have kids right and iPads iPhones are sucked into technology and there's nothing completely wrong with that but if they get sucked into technology and they don't ever come out of it you got issues and being a kid if you remember

<timemark seconds="7638" />

I want people forget this being a kid is hard being a kid is hard and in this particular book there's a kid his name is Mark he's in fifth grade he's got kind of a typical issues at a 5th grader has he can't do any pull-ups showing gym class when they're doing pull-ups he's getting made fun of he's doesn't know his times tables which you should actually know in 5th grade but he doesn't know I'm so he thinks he's stupid now it is not a swim because he never learned and he's when they go on the field trip to the to the lake he does not us wearing so everyone's having a good time and he can't and eventually they call him out on it and find he's getting picked on by the big bully Kenny Williamson the group the fucking can I stay at school basically all these problems come to a head he's all bummed out crying behind the library goes home and he gets home his mom reminds him that his uncle uncle Jake is coming to stay with him

<timemark seconds="7698" />

summer and Uncle Jake is a guy that was a seal in the SEAL Teams and he's just got out of the SEAL Teams and he's going to go to college in the fall but he's going to spend the summer with his sister and with his nephew Mark and so you know that the Navy SEAL shows up Uncle Jake shows up and he sees his own nephew and say you know these are actually stayed in the same room and you say we can do tomorrow if you want to go for a swim and the kid says you like Uncle says okay so you can swim you don't know your times tables you can't do any pull-ups and you're getting picked on we can change all those things we just have to get a plan put it together and make it happen so come on the workout program teaching how to study teaches about a swim teachers in Jiu-Jitsu

<timemark seconds="7752" />

if it was only that easy and what's what's good is

<timemark seconds="7759" />

it's not as hard as people think and I think that's why the books getting strong reaction because there's actually pragmatic message in there on friend since I went through all the stuff not knowing not knowing time tables and went through that with my daughter my oldest daughter didn't or time tables and what she thought was she stupid she thought I'm stupid I don't know my times tables all the kids know I don't know him and I said to her if she's crying you know Season whatever third or fourth grade crying what's wrong I'm stupid why do you think you're stupid I don't know what times tables how much have you studied them I haven't studied oh well how do you think you're going to know if you have anybody to Boom make flashcards an hour later she knows our timetables it's that and so I can actually go through that method in the book how do you learn how to fight your getting picked on how do you learn how to fight you go down to your your Jiu-Jitsu school and you start learning Jiu-Jitsu and you and I both know if you know what you did to in a great school fight in 6th grade you're going to win a hundred percent of the time right so you learn you learn that

<timemark seconds="7819" />

how to swim how do you how do you do that is big things he's afraid of water well why you afraid of the water how do you overcome that fear how do you overcome fear you got to inoculate yourself to it you start off waiting in the water than you dunk your head then you get you know that you eat can you lay down and you feel the water all over your body and then eventually step in and then eventually start the dog paddle and then eventually start to swim in the event you jump off the bridge so he's a real things that's how you overcome fear and that the you know that when I got from my my middle daughter who wanted to be in the school play but she got stage fright and so she would freak out every time she would have to go in front of a crowd so I said okay working on oculate you to being in front of people first you're going to sing in front of me in front of me in front of our friends are going to come over there going to be 10 of them and then you're going to sing in front of you know all of the people that we know at a block party and then you're going to get out and going to do your hair so when she did it and she got an oculated I'll tell you right now she's not afraid of anything

<timemark seconds="7879" />

and so that's the same thing that that he goes through in the book overcome his fear of water he can oculate Stewie gets used to it and then finally the final step is you have to go right that you can't overcome every part of the unknown you have to there should always give me some unknown and doing something that you never done before and then what do you do when you prepared as much as you can and you've done all the training that you can do then you got to step up and you got to go that's what the books about and I wrote it so that kids can apply these things that I learned both in the SEAL Teams and in raising my own kids they can apply to their life and their exp greats been great to see all these kids read knitting and all the great feedback of kids doing push-ups and pull-ups and in training and going down the starting Jiu Jitsu and making flashcards it's it's awesome is awesome it's hot it's a struggle in that you haven't really achieved any success yet in anything what you don't realize is that you got all these possibilities to get good at stuff like

<timemark seconds="7939" />

get out of comfort zone to become a beginner again and it's one of the beautiful things about life is humbling yourself with something new humbling yourself and learning stuff and and kids they don't have that lesson yet so everything is terrifying but once they do learn it if you could teach a kid how to get good at one thing at one of the things that led me to get good at stand-up comedy and all the other things that I did is that I got really good at martial arts young so I knew i k i sucked when I first started I remember socking but I remember I kept working and I get good at it cuz I focused and I put the time and what if I just do that with everything else do you mean you've learned that you can make a path you can do it can be done that's that's that's kind of one of his 10 pull-ups that was his goal and his uncle says you know did you understand what this is about in this kid says you know what this is about everything. Everything that you want to do in life you're going to have to work for you can have to come up with a plan on going to happen to have the discipline

<timemark seconds="7999" />

execute that plan and when you do that you're going to be able to achieve what you want to cheat and that's hard work hard work and discipline is what's going to get you there I'm a lot of kids don't have anybody in front of them like Jocko to tell well and you know what it's interesting so in this book you know Uncle Jake is the character and and he actually addresses that in the end of the book cuz Uncle Jake leaves and the kid says hey you know you're not going to be around anymore who's going to who's going to leave me who's going to help me train and he says you didn't need me then and you don't need me now you know what you need to do you know it's going to take hard work and the other thing that I didn't know smoked which is

<timemark seconds="8035" />

I I I played around with the idea but his dad the kid's dad is not really present and and the reason I did that is because a lot of kids these days don't have a dad around and he's the only thing you said about his dad I put one line in there about it that which was we says my dad's gone a lot for his job and stuff that that's the only line so you have an idea that the kid knows his dad knows that he's out there he's working or doing whatever he's doing but there's a lot of kids out there that don't have a dad they don't have an uncle Jake and that was another reason why the book because kids need to see and learn you if you win the martial arts who told you that hey if you work hard and you train your going to get good at this that would have if you would have done that with martial arts you wouldn't understand up, you wouldn't done it with the rest of your career you decide you know you would have gotten on the stage the first time for 4/4 stand up comedy you wouldn't of made anyone laugh you would have walked off set I suck and going to get the job you know down at down at 7-Eleven

<timemark seconds="8095" />

or whatever you know that's where is if you use somebody said look man of course you suck you just started of course you suck of course you don't know your times tables how would you know if you don't born with that information of course you're not good at stand-up comedy you just did it for the first time you got to learn how to do it a question I couldn't stand up fighting and Taekwondo you've never done it before so you got to learn these things you got to put in the work you learn that lesson 3 martial arts a lot of kids don't get that opportunity I'm trying to give them that opportunity wonder what this book and even for people that aren't kids like something you're not good at it it's really important it's good just try something pick up a new hobby pick up a new discipline try to learn how to play chess just do something you suck at it and let your mind feel what it's like to be at the beginning stages of improvement again I think it's it's very invigorating actually that's good for your brain know they say You're supposed to learn new languages guitar read new books

<timemark seconds="8155" />

continue that's that's what continues just like your body falls apart and I don't exercise exercise as well if I don't do anything new for a long time I feel stagnant but when I start doing something new especially something that I'm not good at so I can start thinking about it a lot I start obsessing about it a lot I get invigorated I get excited about going there we saw the same thing like when our first book came out into leadership book right and everyone thinks hey you know it's another leadership book and then when you read it people, I'll wait a second this is like a new thought it's it's a new thought I haven't seen before we were happy we have these things that we do we're weepers bring people in but we found that there was some small companies or people that couldn't afford to bring us in so we said okay what are we going to do about that so we made this thing up call the muster where we open it up to the public to come and you know

<timemark seconds="8214" />

come and spend two days going through all these principles into same thing that you're talking about they say it's a challenge it's a new fought its thinking about something from a different light people that have been in leadership positions for 5 years 10 years 15 years and I can apply this new methodology I haven't seen hadn't thought about before so they'll continue to grow and learn is just so important across-the-board stepping outside your comfort zone this is one of the most important things for a human being for whatever reason I mean I don't know what it is but I know what works

<timemark seconds="8247" />

and that's it yeah that's what it is man for me that I do that I suck at right now it's it's so important man I just started running really recently like when the last couple of months and I've noticed that you've been posting about that time so it's all crazy you're getting a lot better luck with all right man like your endurance jumps up quick-like within a few weeks I was able to like way past areas I got to get this his Trail that's about 2.7 miles through the hills like real steep hills and there's some spots where I was just fucking dying and now I can get through them and I can get through them and get to the top and I'm still dying but I'm dying less are you going to make yourself there so sorry cuz hours and then you know heart rate watch to which I let my heart rate get down don't like when I when I when I have to take a break on this hill Sprints I'll get my heart rate down to 140 and then I'll start going again

<timemark seconds="8305" />

people ask me that too cuz when you get bored when you get bored of working out and also when you reach your physical limitations right so you wouldn't reach your physical limitations on something you know like you're going to get down to a 6 minute mile let's say and then for you to take it past a 6-minute mile you're going to have to like stop lifting kettlebells get all skinny you know you go to a point now that be your focus and I know I'm guessing you wouldn't want to do that I know I wouldn't want to do that answer for me I'm always jumping around from kind of from goal to goal right like maybe I'll be doing pull-ups everyday swabbing false false was trying to get my Max pull-ups and I get to a point where okay now I'm not going to take it every bit of focus in my life to get to from from 58 pull-ups to 62

<timemark seconds="8356" />

I don't want to do that so I'm cool with 52 and now I'm going to start working on my deadlift I'm going to start change it to more I'm and I'm just constantly 52 pull-ups Yeah Yeah Yeahs pull-ups not not not just full of dead hang pull-ups full dead hang pull-ups the waist belt or do you use Avast window Wipeout and vests I'd like to take to get to Game Changer people live in cramped quarters but pull up bar and maybe a set of rings do so much yourself one kettlebell if you have a yard and you have a kettlebell you could do a lot for a pull-up bar

<timemark seconds="8416" />

dinosaur I mean I mean it's so gigantic and also it's so good for your shoulders just to hang in your house you can you pull up so you can do push-ups you can do squats you can do you know all kinds of burpees and everything else sit ups and got work and you can pretty much get your whole body in really good shape for that one piece of equipment for sure so when you set out your workouts do you do you write them down on paper or do you just have an idea what you want to do I do write them down cuz I kind of log what I'm doing but I'll put down you know whatever exercise I'm going to do or whatever bunch of exercises are going to do when I'm walking down what you know what my timezone if I'm going from time and what the weights are if I'm going for weight and I'm pretty sure I heard this the other day so I'm going to say it they said Arnold was an instinctual trainer so I I do that somewhat you know I'm not like looking at a book and I don't plan out for three weeks or a month in advance exactly what to do that day cuz that day

<timemark seconds="8476" />

I might go damn I don't know anyone that type of work out and I'm I need to not do it I'm going to do something else so I use my what my body's telling me some what that's not to say that I go and I don't feel like doing anything to do today so I'm not going to do it cuz that's a actually a rule that I have if I don't feel like doing something to actually like I need a rest I'll do something that day and put the rest off to the next make yourself do it today and if you still need it tomorrow you can take a rest you can take a rest today not allowed in the logbook you keep like that so you could go back and track progress if you look at yourself so like saved you going to work out tomorrow do you plan it out tonight I know kind of what I'm going to do tomorrow tomorrow I'm going to do a bunch of ring dips I'm going to do a bunch of dips I'm going to be doing a bunch of parallette push ups, do a ton of burpees and probably some

<timemark seconds="8535" />

that's that's going around it out right now I have a little tweak on my knee right now so I can't Sprint like I normally would but otherwise I do be doing some Sprints in there to shoot weeks right now it was yeah it was in joints manatees in the end but if you think about how much time you spend on the mat if I would've been playing basketball or playing soccer at still get the same probably worse relatively free and this is not a bad week it's just like oh yeah it was weak but that's one thing that people to that likes it protects the joints for sure and the back and let other issues I think that is why I have been relatively knock on wood injury-free because due to reasons I work full-time and I never take like any significant amount of time off I never say I'm not going to work out our never just fall into a hand went through months or even two weeks or even 5 days for me to

<timemark seconds="8595" />

show me to not work out for 5 days there was some kind of like something happened I was like majorly sick or I was even if I'm traveling alcohol still get it done but I think that that consistency your body just as used to it and you don't you don't get hurt as often and you're like hardcore metal guy Riley will you listen to I listen to it you know I so I grew up on the East Coast listening to old school hardcore music yeah and so metal and hardcore bands like the Bad Brains cro-mags Agnostic Front old school hardcore bands from from from John Joseph is a trip trip man I watch this documentary about him he's in his fifties takes up his ankles and ship before shows like he's warming up and stretching out does triathlons in between shows right wrote a book called meat is for pussies has a hardcore vegetarian he's like a Hari Krishna I got my the other guy that got it founded that band the Chrome

<timemark seconds="8655" />

he's actually completely as well been completely insane isn't this doesn't even really cast and

<timemark seconds="8681" />

it's it was a different it was a different guest for me a different genre and people in the first of all the guy you know my podcast they expect a certain type of podcast item to talk about leadership on the talk about the military and all the sudden I bring this guy who's been a complete maniac and I mean he's done you know he was drugs drugs act Rock and roll's basically been his whole life and since he was like 10 years old he was playing in a punk rock band in New York City concert in your soul his mom was a hippie his dad was a rumor never stop never been used at the end he is just he just grew up in the streets in Lower East Side of New York City, New York City at all very little I find a tournament New York in the 1980s I remember driving there with the guys from Boston we're driving to the city and looking at it going what in a fuck is this

<timemark seconds="8741" />

place in New York in the 80s is completely different than it is now it was really really bad it was filled with crime like 42nd Street down in Time Square and I will when I was a kid I would go there cuz I was into this kind of music and I was going to see hardcore shows and metal shows and you get off the train and you get out in 42nd Street if you don't know every two steps drugs dust crack everything and that's where he grew up basically without parents and then he's just a crazy crazy story how old is he now he's 50 instructor henzo Gracie in New York on the podcast and it was interesting to have people that listen to it that listen to my podcast which is very good to know you bringing basically all kinds you can get all kinds of such a completely wide variety of people hear my guests

<timemark seconds="8801" />

I've been basically War guys right Ryan stand Tim Kennedy Jody mitic was Canadian sniper wounded real bad in Afghanistan I had a guy named Colonel William Reeder on there who is a pilot Vietnam got shot down and got shot down twice actually captured in Vietnam was in captivity for a year and he's talking about he's you know in a bamboo cage with his legs Shackled and he wakes up in the middle of night because the rats are eating his wounds I mean I'm bringing on guys that are just talking about 9 we talked about heavy subject but they're also talking about it from you know a very

<timemark seconds="8843" />

positive perspective of life right I mean is there anyone more positive than Binh Brian stash do I bring on Harley Flanagan in and he tells his story was really interesting to me DI to have people's reactions and it was a couple people to like all you know this was a real letdown free to bring mon but if you hear his story you listen to podcast me here's a guy who

<timemark seconds="8870" />

you can hear it in his voice like his his heartbroken over some of the things that he's been through his life losing his father his father was at was a heroin addict and in his father died burned alive in a dumpster as he lit a fire to try and keep himself warm that that's how he tries died buried his mom I mean it's just it's just a tragic story but my point is that the even though I had a very few people that would like all that was you you shouldn't have he swore literally he swore a bunch on the podcast that's inappropriate or whatever and then I was really that that was kind of funny that's kind of too bad hear someone say that that they would have that viewpoint but was really cool with all these other people that are very straight-laced kind of kind of Middle Road American people that. Thanks for having that guy on what a heart with a guy and it's good for me to know about that stuff and I screwed for to hear someone else

been through the depths of drug addiction and he'll come back out of it and do all right and then again for my perspective

<timemark seconds="8940" />

I think that my interaction with those kind of people when I was growing up which I certainly had you I was a young kid going to New York and Boston going hardcore shows in all that let me see part of the world that most people don't really see it so when I got in the military I got it was kind of used to dealing with people that people aren't used to dealing with I think it helped me out a lot so it's like 75 episodes up already that's crazy last time you hear yours because I'm going deep on some subject that I'm actually going to like I have to study and prepare for and and it's not interacting with another person most of the time most of time interacting with the history so it's harder for me to prepare now of course you've been preparing for this podcast for 50 years right I mean that's what you've been mentally preparing for getting your turn to your background but I have to like dive into stuffing and so

<timemark seconds="9000" />

is hard my my my my point is yes it's hard for me to do a podcast and pink I got to read a fanbase sometimes they have this idea in their had of what the podcast should be to them like what they want out of it and then they they can express that they don't like where you're going like I don't like he brought this Harley guy on the sky's not what I like I like straight lace military guys who don't swear this guy's of a fucking nutty dude jumps around on stage and the my answer to that is no in and I'll tell you why

<timemark seconds="9040" />

from the beginning of signal when you said and it was you and you and Tim Ferriss them both you guys have you should do a podcast and I said okay do it in the in my eyes are I was cooking I was listening to my kitchen was like Jesus fucking Christ is a good podcast who's intense you know when it was it was so deep and intense and I was like I got it I got to talk to this dude I got to get you one I had known you liked from peripherally jeans fights and I seen you around and that but I didn't know who you were I know your story and Grill Tim had John and sew in with him again when he when he press stop on the on the on the recorder he said you should have your own podcast and then you told me in the middle of the podcast on podcast and obviously I'm the complete idiot not to listen to you what you did and now it's a huge success and soul area

<timemark seconds="9100" />

but as I've done it I've done you know what I want to do and if people don't like it that that's okay I'm okay with someone saying hey you know what your you know I did so I've done some episodes that were horrible man I talked about the me Lai Massacre if you don't know what that is Camille I'm asked her little people talk about these atrocities that Americans commit all the time Americans don't actually committed atrocities all the time but we have committed some heinous atrocities in this one is well-documented Vietnam the My Lai Massacre it was a company of soldiers going into a village and they raped murdered killed around 500 people just cold blood I mean if it's it's heinous it's awful

<timemark seconds="9153" />

probably the hardest podcast that I've done because I'm a patriotic guy in here I am talking about you know American soldiers doing the heinous acts 2 innocent people in it so I have done that I did though I did a podcast about the genocide in Rwanda which was if you don't know anything about that two tribes and it's very hard for Americans understand the difference between these two tribes is nothing it's just two tribes they speak the same language they have the same they look the same they have the same religion which by the way the religion was Catholicism cuz they've been like converted to Catholicism well they went on a rampage and the hutus which is One Tribe murdered 800,000 Tootsie's in hundred days with machetes machetes

<timemark seconds="9203" />

show Auto covered these dark in horrible things on my podcast and I I don't even know really 100% why all the sudden this font in the back of my mind that I've always had which is that you have to kind of understand the darkness of the world in order to appreciate the good in the world and that's why I was really interesting to hear you talkin at Jordan Peterson because he covered that part you know he was saying look man is got a dark side and you won't become a good person unless you understand your dark side in and it's interesting for me because Jordan Peterson is clearly of a highly intellectual one academic guy and I'm not right I'm I'm a nug right I join the military After High School in and yet some of the things he says when he says them I say oh yeah well that's the same thing I stumbled upon he came across that reading the French philosopher or whatever

<timemark seconds="9263" />

I came across it in life and so it's very interesting to me when I hear him say look there's darkness in the world there's evil in the world and we have to face that and end it soon as I heard it podcast Michael that's that's what I think and I can't give you the philosophical basis for it like he can but I can tell you what I've lived through and I can tell you that if you don't understand the fact that there is darkness in the world than that people human beings are capable of evil things if you don't understand that you're not going to understand the first understand what you need to look out for in the world and what we need to beware of as a society and as a as a race of humans but also you're not going to appreciate things in the world that are beautiful and good and positive so with the podcast I'm not doing it to make people happy I'm not doing it to make people listen I'm not even doing it to make people listen I'm doing it

<timemark seconds="9323" />

because it's things that I've lived through its think that I want to understand better and I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing and if people liked it then that's awesome and if people don't want to listen to it that's cool too well at least from my personal experience listening to Guys Like Jordan Peterson or listening to yourself or listening to anybody talk about really deep important subject even if you know what they're saying to be true it reinforces it in your own mind and maybe even opens up new doors of comprehension. Jordan certainly did that with me when I was listening to him talk but he was saying some things like you know like like to talk about dragons and dragons have a goal those like pool Jesus Christ like he was he was he was hitting some notes about human psychology and the reason why we behave in certain ways and the pitfalls of the certain types of behavior that I absolutely knew he was right but and maybe I'll even thought about them before but seeing them a reinforced so eloquently and seeing espresso

<timemark seconds="9383" />

articulately and it really like it it's sparked life in in my mind and even know he was talking about being a warrior right and how these guys in modern times we don't we don't spend time being a warrior if you and I were living 500 years ago you and I would both be battle-scarred and we would be used to that lifestyle Point used to that lifestyle now they kind of Forgotten what that feels like and so that was my life I mean that was my life which prepare for war and go fight war that was my whole life and so for me to look back on it now in here Jordan Peterson to say like that's normal that's okay that's expected and it makes me say okay I understand now we're kind of part of part do I understand myself better when I hear him say oh yeah this is this normal for guys to go out and fight for this is the warrior mentality and when you come back and you

<timemark seconds="9443" />

the truth about it people will react to that deposit which were you saying you're not you're not some academic sitting there reading a book in talking about what you reading the book no eyelids I'm a fighter I fight I've been through the stuff I had physical challenges that's why people are listening to what you're saying you know cuz you have that

<timemark seconds="9464" />

Warrior mentality in your life

<timemark seconds="9467" />

I think the guys like Jordan Peterson I think that anybody that can tap into those truths that we know you know I just don't think we hear them enough I think we're inundated with so much stupid shit everyday it's so hard to get to any like real substantial truths that will positively affect you both your outcome and your your outlook on life and I think you guys like you guys like Tim Ferriss putting out all these amazing podcast Jordan Peterson all these people that can express things to someone like this podcast literally has changed my life I mean is changed my thinking it's you I'm a totally different person than I was when I first started this podcast is talking all these interesting and fast any people and wise people it's been like having some crazy crash course in a million different disciplines and a bunch of different conversation seeing the pitfalls of some people's thinking and

<timemark seconds="9527" />

and being around people where you see the holes in in their of their way they express themselves were the way they process information and it made me recognize though the holes in my own processing in the way I used to communicate with people I'm just I'm a better my better conversationalist now and it all comes from just having these intense conversation this this whole podcast thing is something that I never expected in life I never expected it was going to come along when it came along I never expected it would be something that I would do and I never expected it would be something I consume as much as I do I don't even have radio anymore my fucking car I listen to music if I listen to music in my music that I get off of iTunes or it's something that someone like a new band that someone tells me you're turns turns me on too but I don't listen to anybody like I don't want some satellite radio I don't listen to local radio I listen to podcast constantly or something that is

<timemark seconds="9587" />

nice person so what I'm 75 podcast deep it's been going for a year and some change but when people come up to me now they look me in the eyes and they shake my hand and I didn't know them to like they have these shared experiences with me and I talked about this on that on that podcast about Rwanda they talked about the fact that the first thing they do in a revolution in a coup is they want to take control of the radio and there's this great piece in there where he says they're talking about the fact that with the TV do you have to take what the image on the screen in your mind your eyes process it and then it goes into your brain with reading you take those words and they going through your eyes and it processes many poisons your brain but with audio there's no filter the words are going directly into your brain of their own filter and so it's this that's why I think this pain

<timemark seconds="9647" />

cast audio format is so powerful because the people that are listening to this right now they're sitting in the room with us they're here with us and when I'm recording my podcast I'm actually talking to them and they're there when I go out and I meet people you can absolutely feel like hay and the little inside jokes could even though my dark and evil my podcast is what we we have a good time to when we have episodes that are funny and we talked about regulars we talked about Jiu-Jitsu and food and everything else working out and we have fun too and all those little inside joke people say the inside jokes to me they're not. But he knows exactly what I'm talking about and and so it's it's a very very powerful medium that I think that skipped over and you know where we went from Radio just completely absorbed in the TV and then absorbed into the internet and now all of a sudden we got to this other side where we're back to this thing that there's some reason why people used to sit around that radio and list

<timemark seconds="9707" />

those radio shows back in the day even I did you know when I was a kid for whatever reason I like radio shows I listen to Doctor Demento know my doctor Doctor Demento in the capitals of the radio shows in the skits and it was a powerful medium and I knew it back then and so for for me like you know as soon as as soon as you and Tim were saying you should do it on podcast I was absolutely I'm going to do this and I'm going to everyday you know my goal is that when people press play on my podcast I want them to like be putting their headphones on and like stretching their neck a little bit pressing play and then and then just going okay this this is I want them to get absorbed in it that's what I said when I go with it that you can have your work with right Echo Charles at home Joliet and him and that's it

<timemark seconds="9767" />

what kind of audience if you are on a radio show you have a successful radio show so you'd be in a studio somewhere you have a network behind you. That production meetings have a bunch of people that have people telling me what I couldn't couldn't say no telling me to stop advertisement right now and that's the beautiful thing about leaving money on the table because right now all these advertisers that come to us and they say he can you talk about this when can you talk about that can you and they want to pass money and I just like nope we're not doing it we have want we have on it cuz it's your boy is your company and you help me in the beginning so and good products but that's it that's all that's the only advertisement we have not doing anybody else and so there's no one that can tell me what ya smile on that beautiful face there's a lot to that is a lot to do and also not interrupting your podcast is giant not ever never breaking up that thought not just keeping that thing going

<timemark seconds="9827" />

the and say thank you very much. See you guys next week you know and I just think they do people get locked up in this is like sort of like almost like a trance of the way you're thinking they're there in Jocko's mind you're talkin and they're thinking how you're thinking they like allowing themselves to be taken on his journey with her in their car with her at the gym they're absorbed in your thoughts in a very unique way and because the fox is not a whole lot of other people contributing it in in entering into the picture you know I producers and neck work your ass actives and advertising agencies and look we've looked at the stats and I mean that you could get lost in analytics and never find your true voice but podcast it's almost entirely your true it's so it it's cuz I don't want to say low-tax not low-tech but it's low did this is a small amount of voices you know it in terms of what each individual podcast it just your voice and it may be like mine it's mine in the ghazt and whoever else comes in that's it that's not a lot of

<timemark seconds="9887" />

intrusion and that's where you I mean singular Visions is what makes something it's like there's a reason why Netflix does so well and the reason why a lot of these HBO shows those who is because they leave those working people alone they just helped make up make us Game of Thrones will be back here go ahead and what you going to do going to make a comedy special you know I did my last comedy special with Netflix damn fucking zero notes for me zero I've never done a goddamn thing where they didn't say you can't talk about this can't put that bit in the only thing I've ever done what they said we love it that's it okay that was it I love that joke you do that one I'll do it yeah I actually told that to my publisher about you know what publisher I was like you know what the best thing about my podcast is is that I can do whatever I want to do I can do whatever I want to do and that's what makes it it's in bits are very very liberating there's no book

<timemark seconds="9947" />

how to look like this the podcast is it is just you and the first my first podcast came out and you're my wife listen to listen to it and she was all stoked because when was the last time that you sat down and talked just talked to your wife for 2 and 1/2 hours right it doesn't happen if she got to know me better and she got to know me better because she got to sit and listen to me talk for 2 and 1/2 hours and now she's at she's listen to every single one of them and she's she knows she actually knows me better than she did before the podcast started because I got a wife before kids and jobs in of work and travel all that she can I don't have time to sit there and talk to my wife for for two and a half hour maybe I'm a bad person but that's just the reality of Life honestly when do you ever get a chance to sit like this across from someone running for 3 hours without checking your phone without anybody coming into the room

<timemark seconds="10007" />

up to you with something you have to do or someplace you have to be it's very odd in its that's one of things that I say one of the reasons why I said to change my life is because it educated me on other people stop processes in a way that you just don't you don't get one-on-one dialogue with people in the real world if you think about it you know as we talked about going back into final things but there's a primal think about, having human conversation and if you think about where technology is going we don't have much human conversation so you're a hundred percent right not only am I not having two and a half our conversations with my wife I'm not having two and a half our conversations with anybody until I come up here and sit down with you or until I go into my podcast do you and I sit down and I have a tattoo in our conversation with you know a million people that are going to sit there and listen and they're going to give me feedback on Twitter and they're going to tell me this and they're going to tell me their story and it's it's very it's a weird feeling hot is a hole in communication right now because you know we text each other you know

<timemark seconds="10067" />

show me text each other I text I text texted we're good we're going to send you something just like that's the way it is and it's totally acceptable but there's something missing and if we can't you know we're going to roll train together but there's there's a gap in in human contact right now but in having conversations and I'm just thinking this right now that this is the whole nature of podcasting feels that and if you look at the podcast that do well it's podcast that are conversationalist unless you go with the podcast the time be produced in the ones that are produced by NPR so they have a real money behind them and they're up there different thing

<timemark seconds="10127" />

but the normal dudes that are just sitting around and talking those are popular podcast that's why 10 Sam Harris there's kind of sitting around and talking explaining stuff because that doesn't exist anymore in the in a day-to-day life for a lot of people you know what else doesn't exist in a day-to-day life place where it's okay to be a man

<timemark seconds="10145" />

it's actually okay to be a man that's okay to have man thoughts like everybody so so tone down and neutered it's like human resources and and corporate life as water down people's natural behavior to the point where people are just dying on the inside sitting in these fucking cubicles rotting freaking the fuck out having all these thought that can entertain having to pretend to be someone they're not all day long putting on this bullshit way of talking this fake way of thinking everybody's got to subscribe to whatever fucking ridiculous policies their company wants to enforce and you're just a robot you get out of there you just want to scream or you want to listen to some guys talk about some real she's a real shit and then the kids book because the kids book instead of you know it being about if someone's picking on you go and tell the teacher it's like no actually if somebody's picking on you to defend yourself

<timemark seconds="10205" />

and kick their ass if needed that's that that hasn't been said it's another reason I wrote the book I told the story before but I went and got some book for my kid when he was little my my once on the $3 I went got a book from is it was a pirate book right and I'm thinking Pirates are going to burn stuff take over Villages steal things and I read the complete these guys are complete you know pathetic their pathetic they're not fake Pirates. Manly Pirates right and I just was so embarrassed by a fire truck that's what life is at this another thing that we Shield kids from these days life is hard don't get a trophy you don't get it is no such thing as a trophy for participation that's free

<timemark seconds="10265" />

it's a lie. Doesn't exist you can't learn your times tables guess what you need to work and study you don't get put into a special class and get a tutor maybe you get a new you got some special help to get know you need to work and make that happen you don't don't don't know how to swim guess what that doesn't mean you stay away from the water no do you learn how to swim you step up you man up that's what you do so that's another reason why I wrote the book so that people can actually our kids can learn that life is hard and in order to deal with life you got to be hard that life is hard to something you supposed to shield from them it's so silly and you don't have had this conversation with my friends because everybody that I know that's interesting had a fucked-up life but but now we have kids in the last thing we want is our kids have a fucked-up life so we put our kids needs good schools you live in these nights and Everybody Eats healthy everybody seems it's it's so different than all of our lives

<timemark seconds="10325" />

Roxy talking about like what we all had fucked-up childhoods and everybody we know I had fucked up childhood and they're all interesting but I don't want my kids to be boring but I also want them to be safe so it's like how do you how do you approach that mean I think he get it Mom that's what I've chosen do was get my kids involved in martial arts and and and and give them the opportunity to pursue difficult things and understanding that through pursuing these difficult things like in accomplishing stuff like you you learn something about yourself you learned that you have this ability inside of you to overcome I've got this statement that I made on my podcast about kids and I said if you're helping your kids you're hurting them

<timemark seconds="10364" />

if you think about it right and it was like tying your kid shoe if you tie your kids shoe you're you're actually taking away the opportunity in their life to develop their fine motor skills of times you actually take that away from you and it's the same with everything make your own sandwich make your own bed clean your own room you need to do this stuff yourself and when I'm helping I'm hurting you so I think we can I think we can protect him without just completely coddling them and making sure that every issue that ever could present itself of them have been eliminated as you can end up with some weed Kids R Kids slime kit competitive sports are important whether it's football

<timemark seconds="10424" />

positions where you're going to have to step up and get ground out and like my one of my daughters wrestles and she is either this is the same one that got stage fright and to see her step up and you know we live a pretty good life right minutes did we live in Southern California we live in a nice house it's it's it's it's a nice living right it's a very comfortable situation some of the hardest times that she's been put through is on the wrestling mat and having to step up against some girl that like the exact girl you're talking about some girl from the Barrio in San Diego that's a tough ass girl that's been through the wringer and has domestic violence going on in her house and her escape from all that is to come out and wrestle against the heater down so my daughter has to step up and do that and it's it's an incredible thing it's it's it's incredibly powerful and empowering even I watched her change you know what you would be intimidated by the in those situations to where now she's like bring it bring it I got some

<timemark seconds="10487" />

that's awesome man we were almost three hours in here so anything else that you got a whole has ever showed up I think with this many notes we had a we had all kinds of stuff I was driving up here taking notes on on the Jordan Peterson podcast I need to everyone should listen that's a great great podcasts to listen to in there so many point to be covers in there that are really profound and I think important port today but unusual situation where those coddled soft kids are now in universities and they're trying to run the show with these ridiculous programs of inclusion and diversity and Nina forcing their mindset down everybody else's throat it's really fascinated yeah it's fascinating and disturbing to see all that and it's really yes it's it's actually disturbing to see that happening and see kids could be focused on such an important things in the world and they end up focusing on something that is

<timemark seconds="10547" />

borderline cases borderline you know meaningless you know why don't you listen to moves toward a real goal there's diseases to cure and you know good things to do in the world everybody agrees that racism is bad and homophobia is bad but that's not exactly what you're doing and if it's might not even be in response to any actual real like negative things that have happened like they're trying their trying to create negative things the battle they might not even be there it's just a lot of weirdness today in this world and I think that to bring it back. Oracle a lot of this weirdness comes from a lack of true struggle like do you think these kids are growing up in Russia they're doing backflips off of the top of buildings are they dealing with the same like you know diversity lectures and classes that they have to handle

<timemark seconds="10607" />

forensic part of human beings that wants to be part of a tribe of some kind and wants to defend your tribe and when you grow up in a place where there's no real try but then you look for one to latch onto in these people over here they have a car on a tribe and you can be part of that tribe and you can be and you and then you can lash out at the bad guys and I think that happens a lot and I think it's it's unfortunately unfortunate because it really crushes no individuality which is what I you know that's my kind of my Premier base you know farts are around individual freedom and individual for yourself for your mind like comfort in those groups that these people belong to whether it's you know any kind of group whether it's a hardcore right-wing group or hardcore left-wing group you get in you kind of know what the rules are and you play by those rules and then you surround yourself with a bunch of like-minded people than Echo chamber who also support the fact that these rules are the rules and we have to get these out there in like establish there's a bunch of shit you

<timemark seconds="10667" />

don't steal from people don't rape anybody don't you know don't shoot anybody like figure out a way that we can harmoniously get along together without fucking with each other you know and then just let everybody be whatever they are if you're gay you're gay if you like listening to fucking classical music and and running naked through the streets I don't care just don't you know don't cause trouble don't you know what you want to like individual freedom to do what you want to do hard for insecure people to allow that to happen because into insecure people when they see individual Freedom that's contrary to what their own personal behavior is like they have to question themselves and challenge themselves they decided that person's wrong and these people are wrong and I'm right in this in this needs to be established that we need to fight and we need up and I will go out and punch Nazis or whatever the fuck they think they're supposed to be doing it just gets real weird man it's weird when that becomes your whole life

<timemark seconds="10727" />

when you get this I get a lot which is people on social media that me to weigh in on this thing or they want me to weigh in on this side or they're attacking me because of this attack because of that but that's what people want me to weigh in on things all the time and it's things I just say man

<timemark seconds="10744" />

this isn't affecting me and not only that my comments are going to move this forward and finally I don't care about that thing I understand that you're obsessed with it but I'm not I know I'm not obsessed with this thing that you're obsessed with so I don't even care that you're obsessed with that's cool and when people ask me that I had sounds good you know something to keep keep doing what you're doing sounds great not not my thing move on people get obsessed with things they won't even be obsessed with a few years later like a man I got upset about that thing you are obsessed with and now I'm like you know a lot about that no more obsessed with kettlebells in Jiu-Jitsu do them and get bad around them seems so simplistic it seems like a ridiculous idealistic point of view but it's effective you will be happier and you will be more positive influence on everyone
