bombay work for the entire got twelve is that we're out there in those guys have gone on longer in overall an expression to cross the pacific of the atlantic are on the streets of ocean combat know you'd worked the entire time ahmed is all things of that breaks down swim x. ers their parts for some reason appeasing him out blood on by yet now in that they were coming aft course should bring food for the entire time as well on on on there so that was the key part of it how much food so there's six of us like i said incompetence on the compartments for fall amin others in time you look who permits lazy to think so we're out we had freeze treadmill select roundhouse freeze dried meals on wheels for jab or no weirton of this crazy as the water is the case for you in on a forty foot waves are bounce around is try to hold a job on a troublesome waters pretty tough blood found some close calls the battle we also tom had these bars alas i'm nothing without ross was on abbey's that can cause some nutrition bars out that our maid on the end so that were true wealth remain ardor crossing the dollar's going to kill you or explain them again like hundred paddles men yes so ominous in america crossing one of the comet challenges as basically can you take an awful with you 'cause when i was doing was called on supports an hour we supplies of food or fuel no crossing the limits of an article fifty four days and so wanna get like the most optimize nutrition ahmed so work with this company called skinner process was on a whole foods supplement company in the collies were doctors found food scientists must know when the lab free here and they did all this come across them blood work on my body on try to figure out who basically my exact sort of physiology in the trade these bars based on all of this research that they did found that these are these really high calorie bars 'cause of the most high calories i needed to optimize space aman they were kind of they were all there are planets and ended up in another's the woods and make them no coconut oil not seeds now offer of a different the nutrients in particular makar nutrient when i needed was about forty five percent fat cousin in the high fat combo forty percent protein town than to

and on them not from that i have about fifteen percent our cards bombed and so i see leisurely retirement altman approaching cargo ship there but mom but yeah i worked really well for that answer was to run around like called surprise again and enemies of our mind they're like right hander in this world on those bars work so the lesson like a december theo china boil water and you know all the cephas really challenging on the rowboat the bassa be at this really kind of high optimize nutrition that we could use again for a project like this but the parameters of different you know the humidity is different the temperature is different in six of us now is not as one of me in a twin optimize it for it's an economy of specialty blind palm of the bars again on the base called the calm bar supply popov been incurred the bombard so is really was someone who are there they're not for sale out which we talked about lied to nasa maybe in the future but i you can that you can see on line on the web site like all the difference appearances of the one interesting come by the component parts by yell one day we might might might make 'em but they'd been comes custom for these two product they worked really really well but to clean the rowing so network amazing man are crossing as well but in the rowing it was ninety minutes of rolling on nine units of romanov continuous twenty four hours a day so that we're coming to set the three six of us only three people rollin three people resting in a nine units a year off that's also when you gonna be out the drinks leadbetter only sumner rest basically and so as much time as you can have optimize eating in south meant more sleeping is about these bars get thousand nine him in a row in sheffield eeo thousand calorie bar fine sinopoli nutrition in your body amin center process now and again was amazing to have these bars at work really well for all of us to come optimize not just the food also the efficiency of sleep is asleep got him crazy out there like a demand that is so you you basically sleeping every ninety minutes four are no more hour or so yeah exactly initially depicted him like when once the slow start cranking up eagerness tiny compartment right off you pull the picture the bow for visual is a moment's aggressive cover their mom not cover

like really not conquered all like so all this covering the tiny to harm to the rowing parts not covered because when you're rolling waves a splash of white over top of the union getting completely soaked like you to know who cleans up inside an entirely compartment you know it's like the glow in the stable if he be like a crouched down like in and around the addresses the robot right here assassins soul that's the floor is that where all the food stores and the jani this compartment c. can see that time you look a compartment on either side won the smaller ones they are not really doesn't sleep that's rude sleep on the taser want pass away it's hard to believe this twelve thievery with and the six people things easily six today but still dom c got enough three people and not to be borrowing in three people may compartment singing something into cosgrove said tommy readers want to sit shows and the whole book like what looks like an area where this comes out of it on c. s. c. thus the man like the back of a compartment that's where i was on the house alternating with this guy's the armaments and icelandic i was the captain of bones real experience osha roar bomb handle we alternate inside this little cabin on the other four guys they'll sneak two people 'cause sounds a little bit bigger in the front of the ballot have in front on whether ladylike had to tell in there or you're cracking a little ball it's not it's not glamorous off the gina's jazz offering to those so i'm not really not really i am was a deep diving the team mapping something soloist pretty excited to do something new has a team in doin' somethin' incomplete you explore the complete different kind of atheneum ahmad exploration the ocean something i never done foreign i had actually now and then i know these guys on come on to college italy like really losing you cho economic maybe like our recognize the face of a dinner like that phrasing like than three of them i'd never met my entire life mom and i had also had never wrote about in my life ever before tom and so we see on high he called me out and told me about the project he's go on most worlds most renowned ocean roars he's got no thirty world records is something like

act on complete legend is row boats across every single ocean this was like that all last in a big ocean that he'd never cross know and you know whatever donna just like this before and sell become said hale was his idea but the logistics of super complicated by going antarctica is all this work like trees that you need all of paperwork getting a boat on the south america came pouring in through the panama canal extend early it's like it's how thing he been like how thinking about three years sony he said like harry a sinkhole some big projects chemically county montana know you know your team has got really get there now these logistics and to be interested nynex and looked at ocean rowing bomber couple years ago something that was wanted to one day and so as canada after i'd have got peppers phone call isolate alec guinness go back to america only go back to our time about love but of course the curiosity is ironing out the best of the icon back up as an annual as soon as we begin in cuddled into a home for america and my my team to iraq arms around us are likely to succumb going up the project in his cell phone the visionary of palms up and he dreamed up in a super cool the team of bow with him up again some time alone now this thing he did when you when he walked across america bomb very impressive incredible but i'm sure you've seen the national geographic article guard about him and they said that there was another man from was a norway printed on it already this wasn't the first time someone got across our yet he donned actually further distance yet so something i've been talking about super openly including in my book which is a an ideological be out sullivan unfortunate how much is part to stay out sixteen page letter bomb around asking that today at the track the entire article the reason sixteen pages is unfortunately the entire article arrows is so thrilled with accuracies income misrepresentations and omissions on that yelled at the mass and say hey look you know he can i got this wrong house number probably interviewed for about one thing to its archuleta sky board auslander is now reaching back

absolute freaking out legend so it is guided bomb in nineteen ninety six of new twenty some years before that i attended my crossing days he crossed antarctica out tom from the edge of the coastline across the ice shelf all across the women's across the other ice shelf hombre fleeting hundred miles and when he used to burp own self was husic fight on for a good portion of the time and it's an absolute sterner project it was really weird about service national geographic or record numbers senses is one of the premises of it was thank you caller never talked about for al's slightly he never talked about him in his book he never mentioned and he never lets in my book the woods really bizarre why we're asking for retraction physicist ruined in fact was that you're here i am on page forty nine of my book clearly it says that always an adventure borealis one in many ways to find the terrain of astonishing modern antarctic beats become the first person across antarctica solo we shall eighteen hundred miles occur in sixty three days from ninety six ninety seven knowledge it across the entire landmass in america but it also crossed before on ross ice shelves from the ocean's edge thousands expedition is deeply inspired me was on supported a halt all this food and fuel to the re supplies says we're is like a journalist like wrote this article that was a really mind luck costanza and i had dawned on allows the law speculation tom i did this big project the film projects around the rose with discovery on of matches command discovered our body it is is really bizarre we could talk about all the different on a fine points of that the big distinction and like i'll say i've said it jeff unwrapped rev rooftops will stay here again forget how slim it is absolutely incredible like i'm in awe of the guy when he did in ninety six is phenomenal that's why write about it my book that's why bring about my sons of the dapper finish my crossing the road about on the air as well as about sortie bowman's army i'm standing on the show was a giant sea on well as it would do the right buddy this is impossible for us ours if he didn't first rights of the different

this is just have to really specific distinctions in the world of polar trial is not supported which means not using bomb not using die concern not been resupply with food or feel like i was talking about with the food and then there's on assisted which means not using anything to propel you other than your own body so let's call human cargo so he did is considered assisted on and i use a kite is evident twice the distance to me which is amazing so she and how often did you use the time for us what i've read that is the only use the kite and a few instances where the wind was right so that's another one thing that when as intergraph record or call our law force only got robbed and my sixteen page sell lennon anyone to read it's on my website carla bray dot com slash blah good an idea works with my answer grandpa bomb it's not like it he said he said they were like all had this got wrong is a sexy really count documented and source document that has links to everything alma while ling said shows is actually his entire can of project afterwards in the aftermath i'm talking about including talking about now with pair wing which was that one of his sponsor the guy's actually built manufactured the kind they're talking about how we use it for about a least a third of his journey six six hundred or so miles calm as well as you know he was there would you use the kai going hundred and twenty five miles a single day on which is by the senate it's amazing it's really incredible would be dinner time he did it this is really haven't apples and oranges on comparison it comes to pour travel on the distinctions among all that sounds really travelled further but he use some assistance yet so there is basically these different distinctions in the world polar trouble not to know why things i can compromise or how they got this wrong ayyash and in lincoln's sixteen days in a show the text message on the jury was asked me would tell me about these definitions of on supported and on assisted thomas and tunneling under sizzling six is gonna publish thing on this web site called an article which is six on expeditions remains river expedition on facility in

her son like ron's logistics on n.'s gary clear on supported means no use of relies on assisted means no use of kites or dogs and the thing that i did solo bomb that people i guess about and somewhat confused about birth and first was i was the first person across the land mass in antarctica solo on supported the re surprised and on assisted no cuts or allison did is he was the first person to across antarctica not just the landmass but also the ice shelf so there's frozen ocean on the ice shelves bomb so from the coast across thy self across the land mass across the other itself no one yet including myself has ever done by solo on supported on assisted crossing of both the land mass in the ice shelves to help someone has a manner be amazing ayyad printers seventy five pounds let my body was rent food at the end crossing landmass mom and i defy you need maybe a six hundred pounds lighter something like that or maybe more optimize foods loosen the no-one's gonna get blood found at and on the crowd that was awesome slowed somewhat size music he was out there for all of these other for sixty three days but roughly hours out there for fifty four days were out there a lot different interracial on ok sil the sled really did make a big difference of his own damn much further than knew exactly exactly correct as also uses walmart are you rather how it is out of the fifty four days and use other sioux city three days of amazon that different right and so he like as a customer days he talks about openly he went to his and commoners but if you calculate back to monica hunter in twenty five miles in a fifteen hour period of time but unfathomable does walking pulling a sled they're just two different things it's like the visiting sailing across an ocean and wrong about across the ocean liners in national geographic darpa wrong because the way they wrote it do is you know is they made it look like you're just a faint morton and you know there was a bunch of other explorers and outdoors p.

will that work in support of the fact that thousands on won the first one to do it didn't make this distinction and they actually made it seem wise as if this the sweat was an ingenious solution but it seems like there was a planned thing and that was an engineer day and it wasn't something that he built up on the fly this was the message to be used to help him get across the snow totally anyplace and if you look him up at leisure the arrows got links to actually manufacturing base to talk about as being this elegant solution is thy keeper the kind of random lady that there that have what it's like avoid manufactured thing it's allergic i. m. ike as ed is not a knocking on that i do think that projected for private inspire me the most to do what i did it is amazing that sounds amount we see without slugs is earning photograph of a thousand sky was tulips are the unarmed it's whenever someone does something extraordinary which is no doubt does what you did fifty villages in fifty four though is the law talking crazy 'cause it's crazy imprinted with shit on that is not so old and you're the first wanted to ever done and just hole in that thing in you showed us what was like last time you were here so reluctant some of the areas we have to pull it seems like an insane physical hundred did totally means a alice that has the deaf we tested me to the edges of my potential there was many times on that phone calls for think actually talked about last summer the second chapter my book is called frozen tears because on the first hour trample my slide through seventy five pounds fully load of food and fuel as a crime but others are crying the tears of freedom and that is is all that pathetic feeling amelia was really really brutal really challenging anywhere thing's for sure in the national geographic article they're not not disputing night did that says either so you didn't walk nine hundred thirty two miles by itself across america the town of wood grudgingly gave ukraine and to own something really freaky the f. d. also didn't mention the differences in the time it took you travel them in time to the auslander travel far greater distance york as you

zack height to go with a hundred miles of the dead yes those are pretty big important thing totally and i think that the ethanol flee to pull pull out a picture of the house and how what is heading down in that it's it's like the man by his list of eleven types there with the despotism to denial find yellow finds that implies you know it's a light as it is unfortunate thing on your wrote this letter there a national geographic action respondents other do not think that in the hope we do the right thing the facts are pretty clear on this we're awfully good portion of blood disciplinarian here it was a zest okay yeah that's a big difference i think the biggest fucking tried to get their attention as la carmona to mum about the really helped i'm totally an italian ski you with those things like that the fact that he's dead skis on and he's getting pulled by that kind to me your gliding and yet you not propelling yourself they're both really cool thing i'm delighted to meet with that looked he doesn't have holes in his hands now is is holding on the kiting pulled along by it so he's apart we strapped that type yeah it's like if you hadn't it sport like to get warning on the water soda or less trapped at the waist he's holding on to that that kind but it's calling him bali zhan skis yet scores were you did was hall was tracking polls yeah tracking polls and taddeo cross-country skis askins that the tracks incidents into deep in the snow bonds walking basically to throwing in with my own body fully he's not doing there is a different thing that assured thinks i'm sure there was times we had to walk around yeah i get a man called for parts as well as significant as since been a lot of that when the wind was with him you it this kind lupo long in the fact that he was illegal one hundred miles a day it makes me go away matt why it behind us down on us a different thing to a different thing than the defending national geographic's not recognize that that's different and that he can go on the snow point three hundred pounds more than a hundred miles a cop hundred humming go on

twenty five and one time in nineteen hours flocking ridiculous and as a totally different than a completely completely national geographic jesus christ the slim they should they should've been really clear about that if they were trying to make it out with some elegant solution that he occasionally is no big deal but we really did was made with what he did was fog inmates in the snow no doubt no doubt that we just saw on that image of him getting pulled by that giant asphalt in kite on skis strapped to his harness with all the way behind him also being polled by the giant asteroid that's different bank hundred twenty four miles in the day cooling three hundred plus pounds get the fog and it ate at its heart of laconic twenty four mollison the death blow in melbourne on you guys zack better who holds the american world record for the fastest twenty four hours ever ron ran a full clip and all lemon hours he ran hundred miles i'll sell hundred twenty four miles in fifteen minutes while dragging our son hundreds of power or fifteen minutes as effective as fifteen hours hundred and twenty four miles while dragging hundreds of pounds each year on fifteen hours is insane and that's insane death is zack better henry ron and our hundred miles in eleven hours a break all the world record urban america so were her marriage record never murdered yeah that's a crazy record yet but hundred flocking miles in eleven hours is a crazy wanting that guy did hundred twenty fourth with hundreds of pounds and here in the sled and fifteen hours executives a different that's two different things and if events and self world record correction because that's what we're we're at the outset cuomo public to get the adult american record for so many broken world record was about as actors monster yes shall exact bombed by it he did him being able to do that rhyming is incredible that

hi be able to go further in at just four hours longer holy hundreds of pounds each year calm on national geographic that is two different that's a different and it's not an impressive it's incredibly impressed neither has fought in steel was all stability them into all across the ice shelves and all that should be added to absolute an unnamed the biggest thing for me is on course and it was super trainers are plentiful was in fact hector what that alike for me the whole purpose of any of this the whole purpose of reading the book and sharing with the world and bianca talk to people in a few pockets or never liked my whole goal is to inspire other people step of center comfort zones do things your life towns themselves like this is not about me is not not not just about the b. little bit about to you wrote a book i like the idea when i look now have an opportunity now that surprises me to serve reading a book one point but i had a hundred deal with a book publisher and the notes were so brutal it in my back with a hero's narrowing they might hit you on your right essentially to wear right stand up and i need to be like soap on torrents of our so it does is not how your writings guys which they wanted it without intimidation of the voice in the yeah they actually wanted to take my stand-up be offered to just take my stand up and transcribe it into a book i said never do that no one would george prone to ago to seal of the flock an irs that dileonardo the c'mon man george yes george was a good idea but you said you know the amount needed money george her own bills would deepen the whole d. r. us do our thing some treated more do that but that doesn't mean it's a good idea for a book that won't say what i have walked across lamb as america by myself i'm for both of them some other crazy shit like the parthenon overtones for hodgepodge of the things that's known as at r m reliable as you know ahmad proud i'm proud of the l. common in our report on our insulin to put those towns and journalism thousand little kid like some sauce twelve years old so gone back drama journals and thinking about in others the american piece of this by

it said subtitles from fire nice to talk about him being burned spire in thailand been told out never walk again are we going towards peace my life but why are things that happened long hours and articulates is it was interesting me maybe a fine an interesting is as i was out there by myself in this anti white landscape twenty four hours of daylight cameras white nothingness my mind started filling in with all these memories side guglielmo so my music i'm in silence i'm awful solitude like i said you had joke that a graduated from high school unlike some is in popping your mind right now or do they keep talking in a move on and allows walk out about i suppose i'm pop my head like a color member that your first one reason you're looking at an all the sudden like i'd be back there like acted like the hive in the eye could see mom amish the pool deck and must heal the wind's blowing across my face my conceiving kid next to me i can taste the chlorine in my mounted visceral memories like elusive dream were common back to me for the route for weeks and weeks and weeks the times of the book itself he reads about antarctica buddy intersperse is the way my experience was in an hour ago which was actually going back in for my life is the tapestry of for visceral memories and flashback some other expeditions and child and the ups and downs my personal life and that of all of these things count conspiring in rwanda is it was while the good deep in the brain like that on the shore then we should point one out we've had a part as reform in this broadcast we did before was right after you got that from this journey in our trapped and you describe the whole thing in thailand you tried getting a burned and how are you never know war dead and a alerts of switched out people's souls operate pause can go go by the death and come back and i am tom how would it did it upset you won the national geographic part of him out with judith seal it would discover bronco the meat nice straighten 'em out you know it's closing zombie tears to your perspective on comedians of legacy been around unity and have us afflict murray of milan enemy but it you know to hurt my feelings obviously and i was kind of just it was bizarre

kal with them with it that thus far in and then i have my eyes close of the holding of their time and ice metric motion and he would call the plane likely off on the sides and so i have destabilizing catch you with my left side all my right side salon is stabilization imbalance stuff and then the other piece that was huge you know mike in an utterly does not lie about throwing specifically in terms of the technique of throwing in the technique of ronnie sexy very specific and sell commissar mnemonic an increase would ask alms from portland bombed an icy i called him up and lose its champion roarke leisure rorer home rowing coach and he took me out on the willamette river important in a single man like rolling schools a very different on ocean robot ollie knowledge robots a lot bigger different different ways but he taught me on the river the axle purity of the rolling motions of law that training in the physical aspects and getting stronger with with mike and the mindset need id small things we did there but certainly the stuff that we did ahmad on the rock on the river in nocturnal emma was chris was was hugely actually honors in motion does i just like you would you like how hard can impede is gonna put your arms to go back to ferret out it's a pretty complicated motion it's a full body being upset or admit it's a very courtenay thing you know your power in a different things and certainly on river rowing you're having to omni no square is called squaring the blades and found you needed to take the blades on the water new turn them slickers glide across the top get back in incline on the cusp of self on there's a lot there's a lot of emotion and so it was a short period of time i didn't take my first stroke in a rowboat until july and in that in the ad in the river in august in the ocean robo making him as a team for the first time the train in scotland and an hour's ride across the drake in december is so is a pretty short period of time zeigler new bern about rolling get stronger but it was a fine process to devon is something completely new us all from audience of them are october november and december do you train for all time bomb you out quite a lot but there's other things got his ratings diver in a book out

what do the right above us in our look at the same time manos and traveling doing different things on vietnam is a training was a core focused on but the was like i was like every day knows all is doing is rolling ten hours there some in there there's a lot of things going on the badge in you would need some pretty spectacular intern to do that ninety minutes on the hour every nine months knapp c. n. nine months on nine minutes off one zen analyzed a strategy for do it though because the snobbery shows up too much but yeah so like as if the andino has no lot of rocher on experience of her ms other expeditions account collectively talked about as a team and uses light okay you know this is what he's still has worked the best for people to be not too long stretch get enough rest by not as it may be the first day or two you think alike to grow for four hours a timer something like that needle longer stretch of rest but over time inter party really starts to wear down and so he kind of feel felt that was the happy balance and it's f. l. agony i was delirious we were all delirious and sleep deprived of mikhail we're now there for shore but i think it was the best my body actually held up pretty well i'd a listened on high lizzie how to zobel highlighted the things going on my mind that the nighttime like the night shift was really crazy so the night of the bill in its wants to prolong u. got about three hours of darkness every single night of them at least one nine in shift was complete darkness and so one or you go back to that part is like a mean it's weird enough to be honest high lobo bobbing around the middle of the ocean not come back and forth calm but all is any good complete darkened like you can see nothing is always gonna come out i know where it's very very disorienting how his rulings on my shift it was myself a guy named jamie on versus scotland and dugan kimbell mean a south african guidance on a funny story reviews from absolute legend palms as a three of us out there on our ship and other shift was set in church on the on on on our shift in men over night are now how it started was our first night the reality is complete even rowell
